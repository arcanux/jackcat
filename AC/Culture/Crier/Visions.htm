      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;It's nice to relax and enjoy the Festival Season. I guarantee though, 
      soon as we get comfortable and settled in all happy and tranquil, some 
      nasty monster will start stompin' all over Dereth making a mess of 
      things.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard the Candeth Keep Archmage isn't running her 
      store. She's been holed up in her tower for days.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's the Festival Season again! I love this time of 
      year. All of the masks, pumpkins, the food and the celebrations. Keep away 
      from those scarecrows though, they give me the creeps.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lady Dain asked me to send trustworthy adventurers 
      to see her in Candeth Keep. A warrior she knows may have found a clue to 
      her husband's disappearance.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;You like my mask? Would you like one? Well go and 
      find yourself a head and take it to the Mask Makers.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen an awful lot of eye injuries lately. 
      People should be more careful with thier pointy weapons.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;A battle between the natural and unnatural has 
      erupted in the heart of the Valley of Death!&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I 
      figured the lair the Ancient Olthoi Queen made for herself would have been 
      abandoned after we succeeded in routing her. I thought wrong and received 
      a visit to the lifestone for it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you see? You can carry hundreds of alchemy gems 
      now! No, THOUSANDS! It's amazing!!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who would have thought that Reedshark hide made 
      such a comfortable robe?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Seems as though Aerbax is up to no good in that 
      valley of his. My cousin returned from a foray there recently. He said 
      that there was an enclave of Banderlings fighting a battle against the 
      drudges out there.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Robes! I tell you. Robes!&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Have you seen those new Olthoi Shields? They sure are something!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some folks say they have seen a rather 
      shady-looking fellow loitering around the Obsidian Span. The fellow 
      actually claims to have studied under Oswald, the infamous assassin!&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Have you seen my new leather jacket? I'm not much of a fan of hide armor, 
      but this jacket is just so comfortable!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I used to be so worried about my enemies sneaking 
      up on me! But I can tell you're not going to try to hurt me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you know that they moved us to a new pay 
      schedule? We only get paid once a month, and only on the first day of the 
      month. But I'm expected to be at my post the same amount of hours... Oh 
      sure the town crier is here for you, but where's the love for us, huh?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell of a dungeon being found in the middle 
      of that valley in the direlands.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear the weather in the deserts near Candeth Keep 
      has gotten very windy.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't know what it is about late fall, but 
      creatures are once again losing their heads. And other body parts, too...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;You like my mask? Would you like one? Well go and 
      find yourself a head and take it to the Mask Makers.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who would have thought that Reedshark hide made 
      such a comfortable robe?&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Those Mask Crafters and their apprentices sure have been busy. But, I 
      suppose they have to be, what with our festivals finally beginning.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Here's a little secret: Do not eat chickens from 
      Sawato! You'll thank me later.&quot;<br>

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Seems as though Aerbax is up to no good in that
