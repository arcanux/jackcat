		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Anyone else feel a chill in the 
		air? I guess winter is on its way.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Viamontians in Knorr? I don't believe it. Asheron 
		would never tolerate that... Right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard about Duke Raoul's new brewing recipes! 
		Sounds yummy, and useful, too!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The masks and festival were fun, but I'm glad to 
		have that hot outfit off!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Adventurers returning from Vissidal Isle report 
		that the little Merwart camp now has a full service bartender. Must be 
		nice to be able to relax with a beer, after a long day of fighting 
		Remoran.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that Antius Blackmoor himself has taken 
		an interest in the Viamontian activity at Glenden Wood...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not sure I believe this one, but we have 
		reports that the Viamontians have managed to open up one of the 
		long-forbidden Collegia of Knorr.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I saw someone wearing a really smart-looking new 
		horned helm the other day.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Viamontians are raiding Glenden Wood! What can 
		they be after there? Where will they strike next?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I saw someone wearing a really smart-looking new 
		horned helm the other day.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that a Viamontian force has 
		taken over the old Nexus, way out there in the Dires. Is it just me, or 
		are they popping up everywhere?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that Harlune the Misanthrope has actually 
		expressed concern for something other than himself! More specifically, 
		he's taken an interest in the trouble at Knorr.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Viamontian noble named Duke Raoul has 
		formulated new brewing recipes! His book is available from the barkeeps 
		at Cragstone, Sanamar, Ayan Baqur, and even the new Merwart barkeep on 
		Vissidal Island.&quot;</font><p>
		<font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those Viamontians 
		sure are busy bees! We're getting reports of them raiding so many 
		places, I can't keep up!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin went to visit Harlune recently. He told 
		me that Harlune's been in an even worse mood than usual and is 
		complaining that no one will leave him in peace.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If I weren't bound by honor to keep my post here, 
		I might go off to battle the Viamontians at Glenden Wood myself!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard about Duke Raoul's new brewing recipes! 
		Sounds yummy, and useful, too!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that Commander Kurth, the 
		leader of the Fort Tethana Garrison, has vanished mysteriously. I've 
		always liked old Kurth. He's a good man, and thorough. I wish Queen 
		Elysa would free up more soldiers to help him defend the fort.&quot;</font><br>
