		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like spring 
		has come early this year! I have to say, it's quite a relief. Firewood 
		is getting so expensive these days!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Can it be? Has the Tanada House of Pancakes 
		re-opened its doors?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It sure is a relief that Aerbax's awful plans 
		have been defeated! One wonders what danger threatens the realm next...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a scholar in Zaikhal who is looking for 
		information on Lord Rytheran of Dericost.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard a sad story the other day of a lover lost 
		and a maiden's ghost who forever walks the land looking for him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard of a ghostly woman in white who 
		wanders the Graveyard by day and sobbing. It's probably just a story 
		though.&quot;<br>

		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that the ley lines of Dereth, the paths 
		of magical energy across the realm, have been disturbed by some 
		cataclysmic shakeup. What was the word Aliester the Loquacious used? Oh 
		yes. 'Higgledy-piggledy.'&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard? There is some kind of strange 
		statue that appeared near the Mage Academy. A scholar named Danira the 
		Dusty has taken up residence in Zaikhal, and seeks help investigating 
		it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh just like everyone else, my advice is only 
		good enough for a paltry amount of pyreals! Well thank you, Mr. 
		Pyrealbags this'll go a long way toward providing for my family. I'm 
		sure that an egg will feed me, my three kids and my spouse.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;With the destruction of the plans of the renegade 
		Virindi Aerbax, New Viamont can use this time to fortify itself before 
		the next crisis...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems the weather has turned early. I will not

		Graveyard.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is word of a Bloodless scholar in Zaikhal

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard the mages talk about the

		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard reports that the Bloodless scholar

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The rumored re-appearance of the Tanada House of 
		Pancakes surprises me. Surely they have lost the element of surprise.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the

		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I must admit it cheers me to see the turn of the
