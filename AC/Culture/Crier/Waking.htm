      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Why don't we get a snowman to stand out here in the cold all day. 
      Wouldn't that make more sense than having me freezing solid? That way we 
      Town Criers could take vacations in the winter months and visit our 
      families. Maybe I could even go to the islands. I hear they are pretty 
      nice this time of year. We so need a union.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have a cousin who works in the High Queen's 
      castle. She told me that Elysa awoke and seemed like a new person. She 
      said that she overheard Elysa speaking with Asheron, and that she told 
      Asheron that she didn't need him anymore. What can all this mean?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Now that the High Queen is awake, we've been told 
      that she might once again walk amongst us.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;After my shift I'm going to head over to Celcynd in 
      Rithwic to turn in my gold stamped letters--I hear the Explorer Society is 
      issuing new armor and weapons these days.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Strange things have been happening lately. There 
      are reports of adventurers disappearing from the Marescent Plateau and of 
      suspicious looking people dressed in black stalking the towns late at 
      night...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those signs in the capital cities are peculiar. I 
      kept thinking to myself when I used them.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh just like everyone else, my advice is only good 
      enough for a single pyreal! Well thank you, Mr. Pyrealbags this'll go a 
      long way toward providing for my family. I'm sure that an egg will feed 
      me, my three kids and my wife.<br>
      &quot;Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine told me about this great new 
      device that lets you know when someone's at your door. You see, it rings 
      this bell, that way, if you're in the basement... well... yes, I suppose 
      you could knock. But, this thing is nice and loud and you could hear it 
      even if you're in a mansion and... yes, fine I suppose you could knock 
      loudly and holler. And you could always just hop through a window and let 
      yourself in.&quot;</font></span></p>

      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those snowmen are back. It's weird having snow talk 
      to you... It kinda gives me the creeps.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The furniture vendors have a few new houshold items 
      in stock now. I wish I could go home and enjoy all the things I've bought, 
      but I have to stand out here in the cold just so you can get the latest 
      news and information. No, no, don't worry about me, I'll be fine out here. 
      All alone. Without something hot to drink to keep me warm...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;My brother's friend's sister's boyfriend's father 
      said there was some commotion out on Aphus Lassel a few days ago. The 
      whole town, if you can call it that, was in an uproar over something about 
      a sacrifice.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Things seem to have changed since High Queen Elysa 
      woke. She's increased pay for us town criers, and even increased the 
      activity of the Royal Guard. There's no telling where she might be looking 
      to do next.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Last night this strange person walked up to me and 
      handed me some sort of recruitment pamphlet. It was right, I do feel 
      unappreciated.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Royal Guards in Lytelthorpe are looking for 
      individuals to help in divine secrets that lie in deep caverns that 
      stretch to the sea. Additionally, there is a call out in capital cities 
      looking for adventurers who wish to help find the failed assassin, who 
      tried to kill the High Queen.&quot;<br>

      &quot;All they said I needed to do was to crush the Calling Stone attached to 
      their pamphlet and they would come to take me away to a better place. A 
      place where I was something more than an underpaid information broker for 
      the masses...&quot;</font></span><br>
