		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard stories 
		about adventurers hunting down and killing a large &quot;Mukkir.&quot; I have no 
		idea what a &quot;Mukkir&quot; is, but it sounds scary....&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that 
		the Raven Hand is looking for some ancient power source. I hope they 
		don't find it.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Another beautiful spring! And all of the animals 
		are having cute little babies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen people running about in what appears to 
		be Alduressa Shadow Armor. I wonder where they got that...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Essences are moving again. I for one am not 
		going to be around when they get wherever they're going.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's another mysterious person in Ayan Baqur, 
		looking for &quot;very loyal&quot; people to help him out. How very cloak and 
		dagger!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friend told me he'd gotten a new weapon out of 
		a treasure chest... But he wouldn't let me see it, because the last time 
		he let me handle one of his weapons... Well, I lost it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's another mysterious person in Ayan Baqur, 
		looking for &quot;very loyal&quot; people to help him out. How very cloak and 
		dagger!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin told me that he met a Viamontian 
		Armorer near a keep outside of Silyun. This armorer was crafting Shadow 
		Armor much like the ones our three Master Armorers do.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ciandra has asked for more help in studying the 
		Essences. If you are capable of helping her you should visit her in her 
		workshop above Xarabydun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So have you heard about these Runed Weapons? Very 
		fancy! I hear tell they were commissioned by Varicci's forces long ago, 
		but they were looted from the royal vaults!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that the White Rabbit has a son. 
		Imagine if you will all of the rabbits of this world being as dangerous 
		as the White Rabbit. You know what you have to do.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Adventurers have reported that they've found Gems 
		that will open a gateway to a nest of Mukkir, whatever they are.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have loyally served Queen Elysa and the 
		rebels of Silyun, and have already helped the Whispering Blade, you may 
		want to consider going to Ayan Baqur to speak with a man named Harkwull.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard from a friend that Ulgrim was loooking 
		for the same power source that the Raven Hand is looking for.&quot;</font></p>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Those Runed Weapons? I have nothing to say, except that I strongly urge 
		you to recover some of them. Seek them out in chests of treasure...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been reports of adventurers finding 
		their way into a nest of Mukkir. This should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Even you, thin-blooded outlander worm, can aspire 
		to serve the Rossu Morta if you prove your loyalty. If you are one of 
		those Bloodless enlightened enough to have previously earned their 
		trust, seek out the local Experimental Thaumaturgist in Sanamar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard reports of variants of Alduressa 
		Armor being made out of alloyed crystal. Is that even possible?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci has asked all loyal Viamontians to 
		aid the Bloodless alchemist Ciandra in studying the return of the 
		Essences. The Essences are dangerous. On this subject we and the 
		Bloodles are in agreement.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yes, the air is fresh and the trees are green. If 
		you attempt to give me a flower I will cut you down where you stand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that the Chaotic Virindi are looking 
		for some ancient power source. Kill all Virindi you see in order to 
		insure they do not obtain it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard from another Crier that the drunkard of 
		Ayan Baqur is looking for the same power source the Chaotic Virindi 
		seek. I would be amused to see him blow himself up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If the White Rabbit's children were to survive I 
		fear that a new dominant species would sweep across the land.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard reports of an Alduressa armorer 
		creating armor using gems crafted of crystal and shadow. The reports 
		place this individual near the Knights of Karlun fort, near Silyun. This 
		should be investigated as quickly as possible.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Runed Weapons! Masterfully constructed weapons, 
		commissioned by our own King from Silveran smiths long ago and brought 
		at great expense to this land... Stolen by what I can only assume are 
		Bloodless thieves and scattered to the four winds... What perversity!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been reports of adventurers collecting 
		gems that transport them and their fellows to a nest of Mukkir. If these 
		reports are true, it could be of great use to those who have been 
		researcing these strange creatures.&quot;<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can tell just by the smell of you that you are 
		a Bloodless weakling, but if you have managed to choose the correct side 
		in this war, and have earned the trust of the Grand Knight and the 
		Ordina Rossu Morta, you should report to Melaverre of Sanamar to make 
		yourself useful.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;After the loss of life in the North Dires, our 
		King is taking more active involvement in any strange events in the 
		world. For instance, he has his own alchemists attempting to uncover the 
		secrets of the Essences. For now King Varicci urges those with strength 
		enough to go forth and impede the Essences' progress.&quot;</font></span></td>
