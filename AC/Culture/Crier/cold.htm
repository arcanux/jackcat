		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Happy Holidays! Only 
		a few days left to donate to your friendly Town Crier. Anything you can 
		spare is appreciated. It all goes to a good cause, feeding my family.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I saw my cousin recently, and he had a pet 
		Penguin!&quot;</font><p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town 
		Crier tells you, &quot;There was a mild earthquake around the Yanshi region. 
		No injuries or major property damage have been reported.&quot; </font></span>
		<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ayep, it's gettin cold again. A storm's comin'. I 
		can feel it in my joints for sure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My advice, friend? If you find something that you 
		don't recognize, find an expert to identify it for you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I tend to pay a visit to Frost Haven this time 
		every year. It's such a scenic little Snowman village when it's not 
		being stomped on by that magma golem.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ayep, it's gettin cold again. A storm's comin'. I 
		can feel it in my joints for sure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of another Tanada Clan training 
		ground. Where are they all coming from?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that some associates of Ben Ten are 
		out searching for Asheron... Where could he have gone?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear the 
		Abominable Snowman has been particularly unpredictable lately. People 
		will animate anything these days. I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a 
		Cheese Golem.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you want to investigate the mystery of 
		Asheron's absence from the world, I suggest you talk to Shan Zhen of 
		Cragstone, who is looking for able adventurers to volunteer for just 
		such a purpose.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin was telling me he saw a Penguin in the 
		Vesayan Isles, relaxing under a tree, eating candy... That's just odd.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard that Bretself, the Translator in 
		Cragstone, is getting a lot more business these days...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I think I'll dust off the old fruitcake and give 
		it to a friend for the holidays. Those things last forever. I think the 
		one I have now was my grandfather's.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you know Metos was actually a person? 
		Apparently he was an Empyrean expert in the construction of Golems, and 
		a friend of Asheron. You learn something new every day...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors that Sayuji Jina has more work 
		for those who've helped her investigate the sudden surge of the Tanada 
		Clan in Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some scholars think that the recent earthquake 
		was centered around Lady Folthid's estate, northeast of Yanshi. Might be 
		worth to investigate any underground structures in that area - assuming 
		that they're safe, of course.&quot;</font><br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that another Bloodless assassin 
		group, called the Te-nada, or something like that, is growing on the 
		mainland. Heh. The Bloodless can't even keep control of their own...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that a Bloodless sage in 
		Cragstone seeks adventurers to follow the trail of the vanished and 
		impotent mage, Asheron.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I just saw someone run by with a pet Penguin. Why 
		someone would take the time to train a Penguin to follow you around is 
		beyond me. Why not something useful, like a pet Eater, or somesuch?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My advice? If you find something that you don't 
		recognize, find an expert to identify it for you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Haha, I hear that there's a crazy snowman 
		smashing up other snowmen in the Southern Osteth mountains! I'd pay to 
		see that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The latest reports are that there was an 
		earthquake in the Bloodless town of Yanshi. Unfortunately, they suffered 
		no lasting consequences.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hope you appreciate that I stand out here in 
		the cold for you people.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;On behalf of His Majesty King Varicci II, I have 
		been authorized to wish you a prosperous holiday season.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard reports of adventurers dealing with a 
		strange, candy-eating tropical Penguin on the Vesayan Isles. He seems 
		very popular for some reason.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have been informed that a lot more interesting 
		information seems to be flowing through the hands of Bretself, the 
		translator who lives in the Bloodless city of Cragstone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports of a Bloodless sage, called 
		Sayuji Jina, investigating the reappearance of this clan of Sho 
		Assassins, and her continued efforts to learn about them. Such 
		information could also be useful to His Majesty, and should be 
		investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Much as I may like to joke about it, perhaps 
		there is something worth investigating in those disturbances among the 
		snow creatures of Snow Haven.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Though he would never say anything openly, I do 
		believe the King desires that strong Viamontian adventurers visit 
		Cragstone to speak with the Bloodless known as Shan Zhen, to see whether 
		Strathelar's protector is well and truly gone from Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard of an Empyrean named Metos? I do 
		not know what is significant about him, but adventurers have reported 
		strange discoveries in the Halls that bear his name.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ah, this bit of coin reminds me... King Varicci 
		wishes you and your dependents a very prosperous Holiday Season. He also 
		notes that he will be sending the tax collector around soon. So get your 
		accounts in order.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who knows what evil magics the Bloodless Lady 
		Folthid is conducting on her lands... rumor has it she caused the 
		earthquake in Yanshi.&quot;</font></span></td>
