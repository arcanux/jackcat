		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Those creepy little statues that popped up not long ago are hiding even 
		more than they were before. Don't believe me? Go see for yourself.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard something about an assault having to 
		do with Aphus Lassel.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tumerok ambassadors have been seen in Holtburg 
		and Ayan Baqur. They say that they are here to hunt some of the 
		strongest foes that Dereth knows.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Apparently there's been some new finds on Marae 
		Lassel. Something about a cavern on the island, or maybe the island is a 
		cavern? I don't really know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen all the new items that some vendors 
		are carrying? You should really take a look.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Renegade activity on the northern outskirts of 
		the Valley of Death has been reported across Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A lifestone in every town and a portal that takes 
		you there! I'm curious, why did the Lugians help move the allegiance 
		halls so close to town. What's more, what is that odd looking stone in 
		front of them? The High Queen has told us that we'll know the answers 
		very soon.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you noticed that magic seems to have changed 
		again? I'm fairly sure that I can heal more wounds and that spells that 
		weaken me in some way are disappearing faster.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there are small bands of 
		Mosswarts fleeing the Blackmire, looking for some new home.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I think that it was a nice gesture of the High 
		Queen to commission the relocation of portal drops. Now even more people 
		are coming by to visit me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you happen to be out hunting make sure you 
		pilfer your kills. You never know what you may find out there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those three Tumerok brothers are rather strange. 
		Who goes out and picks a fight with creatures that are so darned tough? 
		Not me, I'll tell you. Give me a nice safe place like a town and I'm 
		happy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Strange gems are being carried by some creatures. 
		They seem to lead to secret locations that we haven't heard of before. 
		Go figure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh just like everyone else, my advice is only 
		good enough for a paltry amount of pyreals! Well thank you, Mr. 
		Pyrealbags this'll go a long way toward providing for my family. I'm 
		sure that an egg will feed me, my three kids and my wife.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know, I almost feel sorry for the Mosswarts... 
		sure they're a nuisance, but I feel like we should try to help them in 
		some way. These new creatures are much worse!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Okay, you didn't hear this from me. Apparently 
		the Tusker King has been losing control over some of the humans on his 
		island. He's been busy trying to make sure that they don't get free and 
		has begun a new assault against them. Do you think that the tailor there 
		is winning his hidden fight?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not talking to those creepy little statues, 
		but I've heard that something else has appeared in the place that they 
		guard. Some creepy little thing with wings!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen full fellowships of people casting 
		spells on one another all at once. I can't help but think that being 
		able to use those spells and the other changes to magic are related. But 
		the question is, is the power behind these new benefits benevolent or 
		malignant?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin said that he was out in the Direlands, 
		just north of the Valley of Death, when he saw war machines being rolled 
		across the desert sand. War machines! What does that mean?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Aun Tumerok have expanded on the weapons that 
		you could craft from their totems before. I heard that one of the 
		Tumeroks left the caverns where you buy the totem weapons. Maybe they 
		had a fight, maybe you should check it out.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you know that they moved us to a new pay 
		schedule? We only get paid once a month, and only on the first day of 
		the month. But I'm expected to be at my post the same amount of hours... 
		Oh sure the town crier is here for you, but where's the love for us, 
		huh?&quot; </font></span></p>
