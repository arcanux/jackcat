		&quot;Some small creepy statues have been showing up in towns, they make me 
		nervous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've found the oddest assortment of items on 
		creatures around here. Drudges dropping weapons and armor, golems with 
		magic enhanced items and rats with lots of random pieces. Strange?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know that farmer outside Lytelthorpe -- the 
		one with the rabbit problems? Selflora says he's back.&quot;</font></span></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ufet, Prophet of 
		Blades, in Zaikhal, has been even busier now than he was before. I 
		wonder what he is up to.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'd always thought that the robe from Frore was a 
		little drafty. I guess I was wrong.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you visit Frore can you bring me a helm, I 
		want to get one and dye the trim black.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that Larry was having a tryst with 
		Nuhmudira. Now that she doesn't have any real clout, he's cast her aside 
		like an old worn blade. What? That's what I've heard.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you want to visit Frore, best remember to take 
		a group and be ready to face creatures tougher than Dark Revenants. 
		Seems the inhabitants are preparing for tougher battles.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen it, with my own eyes, people who have 
		shrugged off Asheron's protection go and look at those creepy statues 
		and disappear!&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those Shreth are 
		disgusting creatures! They'll eat anything! Even the corpses of fallen 
		adventurers.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know that farmer outside Lytelthorpe -- the 
		one with the rabbit problems? Selflora says he's back.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I stumbled across an encampment not too far from 
		Zaikhal the other day. It was eerily empty and unoccupied. As if the 
		people there just disappeared!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you been to the Lost City of Frore recently? 
		I've heard that the undead there have begun to reinforce their halls.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen it, with my own eyes, people who have

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey! Need a Patron?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm sure that if you pledge allegiance to me, 
		that I'll be able to give you any fine items that are handed to me. I'd 
		be a great patron for you.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Okay, here is the 
        plan! You get a fellowship together in Yaraq, I'll get one together in 
        Plateau and we'll go take control of the Battle Arena! What do you say?&quot; <br>
