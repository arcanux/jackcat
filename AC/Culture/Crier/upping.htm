		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;A rarely seen 
		Merwart has appeared in Ayan Baqur, looking for help against unknown 
		foes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scholars are still unsure what the disturbances 
		along ley lines could possibly mean. All they know is that the fabric of 
		the planet itself is fraying.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A tall figure has been seen running around the 
		Graveyard and laughing like a crazy person.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Whispers from scholars of more forbidden arts 
		suggest that an ancient Falatacot god is behind the disturbances...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word has it that the Burun could use some help. 
		Time to hop back into the ol' portal to Bur, right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Geomantic scholars report fluctuations and 
		disturbances in the network of ley lines that crisscrosses Dereth. What 
		could it mean? Is it linked to the terrible things that happened in the 
		graveyard thousands of years ago?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Jester has been seen in the Graveyard. From all 
		reports he sounds quite mad. He's lost his cards as well as his mind. 
		Someone should help him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that it's specifically Tmauruk of the 
		Burun who is asking for help from us. Might want to go there first.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We don't know exactly what is going on with all 
		the incidents around the world, but there are suggestions that an 
		artifact of ancient evil, some kind of book of terrible knowledge, is at 
		the source of it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a strange little Merwart named Mundagurg 
		in Ayan Baqur, who seeks assistance from adventurers in combating some 
		kind of Moarsman assault.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>

		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Royal scholars 
		know that the network of ley lines, the very circulatory system of this 
		planet's magical energy, has become unstable. What they do not know is 
		why.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A strange little creature that calls itself a 
		Merwart has appeared in the Bloodless town of Ayan Baqur, begging for 
		help against some mysterious threat.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The royal scholars know little about what is 
		causing the problems all across the world, but other scholars, who know 
		the darker places of the world, suggest it may have something to do with 
		the ancient Falatacot gods that once dominated this whole island...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've received reports of a ridiculous trickster 
		in the Graveyard in the Direlands. Be careful, he appears as powerful as 
		he is mad.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The frogs need help - excuse me, the 
		bloody-minded frog-like beings who tried to kill you when they first 
		arrived in Dereth need help.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The strange Merwart of Ayan Baqur appears to be a 
		primitive offshoot of the Mosswart race. This Mundagurg, as it calls 
		itself, seeks help in fighting a local infestation of Moarsmen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We are not sure what is causing the recent 
		disturbances across the world's network of ley lines and nodes, nor are 
		we even sure of the consequences if the system truly ruptures. But it 
		seems certain that there are factions mobilizing to profit from the 
		chaos that would ensue... Keep alert in the weeks and months ahead.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A very powerful knight told me he was unable to 
		kill the insane Jester who has been roaming the Graveyard of late. He 
		said every blow he landed elicited only more laughter and hysterics 
		while the wounds closed almost as fast as they were made.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Then the Jester tossed him hundreds of feet into 
		the air and shot spells at him, obliterating him before he hit the 
		ground. He found a note on his corpse later saying 'Thanks for the fun! 
		Let me know if you find any of my cards.'&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our sources suggest that there is a book of 
		ancient and catastrophic evil at the heart of our current disturbances.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Frankly, given the choice between Falatacot and 
		Burun, I might choose the Falatacot. That's just me, however.&quot;</font></p>
