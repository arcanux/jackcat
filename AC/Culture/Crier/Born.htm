		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Monty seemed to be 
		complaining about Ketnan and his guile the other day. I wonder what he 
		meant.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I wonder if the High Queen means to rebuild 
		Yanshi. The town has certainly been more bustling since the arrival of 
		the Burun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I cannot verify if it is true, but I've heard 
		that Shimena Keep has been overrun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you hear that we might make a treaty with the 
		Mosswarts? Has the high Queen gone mad? Does she not remember what they 
		did to Sir Candeth Martine?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Be cautious if you plan to make your way to 
		Aerlinthe Island. There are reports that tell of new menaces and 
		challenges.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you been to the Direlands recently? I've 
		heard that the swamp is starting to change. I wonder if it has anything 
		to do with those big Burun that have been spotted. If I find that 
		Kalazar...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What color hair do you think Lady Aerfalle had, 
		has, oh never mind?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So I'm sure you've noticed that I haven't left 
		this spot in nearly four years. Yeah it's a tough life, standing here 
		all day. Sure... sometimes people are nice enough to give me Shackles of 
		Obedience. But I was wondering... Need a patron?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! The Master Craftsmen of Glenden Wood have 
		sent more of their young apprentices in the world. All those who wish to 
		further their artisanal skills should contact the apprentices to 
		discover what new crafting tests are available.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just yesterday I saw someone run by with wings on 
		his back. I don't know whether they were real, or merely something 
		tacked on to the back of his armor. Maybe you should look into that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Be cautious if you plan to make your way to 
		Aerlinthe Island. There are reports that tell of new menaces and 
		challenges.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that there is an eerie presence 
		that now lurks the halls of Lady Aerfalle's Keep. I wonder if it is 
		another malignant entity?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;An emissary of High Queen Elysa has taken up 
		residence in the bar in Yanshi. Apparently she is looking for assistance 
		in learning as much as we can about the new Burun and the growing threat 
		that they pose.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen it!? It's huge! It smells foul and 
		no one can seem to figure out what it is meant to be. But it was 
		certainly made quickly and quietly. Those large Burun are very 
		frightening if you ask me. You might want to stay out of the Direlands 
		Swamp unless you are looking for trouble or worse.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you remember that little Mosswart fellow that 
		was looking for help a little while back? Well, he's back. He's living 
		in Yanshi and asking for our help. Apparently he has made some kind of 
		deal with High Queen Elysa.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard a rumor that the temple that was found 
		last moon contains more than we originally found. I wonder if it is 
		true?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;In my free time I've been undergoing the tests 
		set forth by the Apprentice craftsmen. I'm well on my way to becoming a 
		skilled fletcher! And my purse is filled with pyreal as well.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just yesterday I saw someone run by with wings on 
		his back. I don't know whether they were real, or merely something 
		tacked on to the back of his armor. Maybe you should look into that.&quot;</font><br>
