		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Look! In the sky! Didn't you see 
		it?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not going to stay out here if things get any 
		worse.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear Shadows have been seen around the 
		outskirts of certain towns...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Silveran weapons now? Very fancy-looking, aren't 
		they?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that this mysterious and terrible 
		thing named Grael has been released, but there have been conflicting 
		reports about what, exactly, Grael is.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I like what I've heard about those Chapterhouses, 
		but I don't know... Doesn't it seem like there's something missing?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been rumors of a faction of the Raven 
		Hand who have joined with Isin Dule. What's next, an entire kingdom of 
		Shadows?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell there was some kind of collusion 
		going on between Count Dardante and the Raven Hand... I wonder how that 
		worked out for them?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors about a Raven Hand cultist in 
		black and red, calling himself the Emissary of Isin Dule, moving along 
		the north coast of Dereth, looking for something. What're those Shadow 
		cultists up to now?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that something went terribly 
		wrong for Count Dardante with this whole Grael thing. Rumor has it that 
		the Rossu Morta is investigating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I haven't been able to go out and go adventuring 
		to earn myself entry into a Chapterhouse, but I can already think of 
		ways I'd want to improve that kind of facility...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Travelers passing near Arwic have reported 
		hearing whispers in the air near the hole where the Shadow Spire augured 
		into the ground.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I knew that those Royal Runed weapons were 
		powerful, but I have heard tell of even more powerful weapons, crafted 
		in the unique Silveran style and bearing a red sigil...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What's wrong with the sun? The last time 
		something like this happened, Bael'Zharon began to stomp all over the 
		world! I remember it! I was there when he rained rocks on Stonehold!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've got it on good authority that the Whispering 
		Blade is trying to track down Grael, and is feverishly gathering 
		evidence on what in the Abyss he truly is. All Whispering Blade 
		operatives have been summoned to the Chapterhouse to this end.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard a secret, but it'll cost you more than 
		that.&quot;<br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Those Bloodless in the Order of the Raven Hand seem to have split into 
		different factions. It's no wonder the Bloodless lose every war, their 
		leaders can't even keep them together when they are outside of 
		conflict...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I see nothing unusual about the sky. Stop 
		fomenting social unrest!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been rumors of the Whispering Blade 
		and their frenzied search for clues about... Well, never mind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Don't even ask me about those Silveran weapons. 
		The saga of the distribution of these weapons has become farce.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The royal heralds were given a brief tour of the 
		Rossu Morta Chapterhouse. Quite a great honor, and I am envious of those 
		who have earned the right to base themselves there. But it felt like 
		there was something missing...&quot;</font></span><p>
		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Even you, a Bloodless mongrel, may earn Count Dardante's esteem by 
		helping the Rossu Morta conduct a certain sensitive investigation...&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears those Raven Hand released something 
		old and hateful into the world. Do not worry, King Varicci is well 
		prepared to fight the spawn of Shadow.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are you a loyal subject of the King? If so, you 
		should see what you can do to assist the Rossu Morta in its 
		investigations.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are you one of those elite enough to have earned 
		admission to the Rossu Morta Chapterhouse? A loyal subject of King 
		Varicci might want to think about ways in which the Rossu Morta 
		chapterhouse could be improved...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been reports of one of these Raven 
		Hand cultists, one who follows a &quot;Shadow&quot; called Isin Dule. He's been 
		spotted on the north of Dereth, wandering from place to place. He seems 
		to be looking for something. Any information on this individual would be 
		appreciated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I cannot help but laugh at the Whispering Blade's 
		desperate attempts to catch up with what has been going on. Suffice it 
		to say that those ignorant running dogs of the Bloodless queen are a day 
		late and a pyreal short, again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty is quite wroth over the distribution 
		of these Silveran weapons, which are even more powerful and more highly 
		treasured than the Royal Runed weapons. He has had four different Royal 
		Quartermasters tortured over it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;No, I do not see anything strange in the sky. It 
		looks like a fluffy domesticated animal of some kind, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Rossu Morta seeks help in the investigation 
		of the fate of some of Count Dardante's most highly placed lieutenants. 
		If you are a loyal subject of King Varicci and a member in good standing 
		of the Rossu Morta, it is your duty to report to the Chapterhouse and 
		assist them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We can handle this minor Shadow infestation. This 
		is another chance for our people to prove their glory in battle!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;</font></span><p>
		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;It 
		seems unlikely to me, but if you are one of the Bloodless who has proven 
		himself to be a trustworthy member of the Rossu Morta, you should go to 
		the Chapterhouse and offer your assistance in this matter of Count 
		Dardante's assistants.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Surely you can spare more than that. Do I look 
		like a common beggar to you?&quot;</font></span></td>
