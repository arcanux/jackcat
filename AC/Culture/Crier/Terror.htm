      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some olthoi hunters 
      claim to have seen lugians moving through the mountains that border the 
      Olthoi infested North.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you hear what happened at the last council 
      meeting? Someone tried to assassinate High Queen Elysa!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen the new masks that the mask makers 
      have crafted? I think that they have outdone themselves this time.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;No one knows who it was that stabbed Elysa. Asheron 
      hasn't been seen outside of his tower. Antius hasn't left Elysa's side 
      since the attempt on her life... The only person that seems to be willing 
      to lead us is Nuhmudira.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The townsfolk of Zaikhal have been talking about 
      increased visits from Nuhmudira recently.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;A traveler along the western shore of the Direlands 
      reported seeing cowled figures chanting at the crest of a building that 
      peaked out of the water. From what I hear they were undead... but nothing 
      like we have ever seen.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The leader of the town criers left, fortunately one 
      of the old leaders came back to take their place.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;With all the Olthoi around, I hadn't notice the 
      increased undead activity in the Direlands. I?ve never seen those undead 
      before, have you?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who is this undead mechanic I've been hearing 
      about? I hear he lives on Marae Lassel, perhaps someone should find out 
      some more about him.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen her! 30 feet tall, three heads?magical 
      powers, she breathes fire, lightning, frost and acid! She devours her own 
      young and lives in a pool of sweltering acid? at least that?s what I?ve 
      heard about the Olthoi Queen.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Nuhmudira has pledged to bring an end to the Olthoi 
      Queen, I believe she can. She's much more powerful than Elysa!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not surprised that Asheron is cowering away in 
      his tower. I agree with Nuhmudira, we're always doing his dirty work!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;An explorer reported seeing Renegades carving a 
      path in the mountain shortcut. Why don't they just go take that island 
      from the tuskers?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;An ancient structure crested through the surface of 
      the water along the western shore of the Direlands. I've heard that some 
      travelers believe it is the top to a much larger structure that lies 
      beneath the sea.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that the Renegades have been having 
      trouble with the Olthoi too. Maybe the Olthoi aren't so bad after all... 
      oh, never mind.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you know that they moved us to a new pay 
      schedule? We only get paid once a month, and only on the first day of the 
      month. But I'm expected to be at my post the same amount of hours... Oh 
      sure the town crier is here for you, but where's the love for us, huh?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;So I'm sure you've noticed that I haven't left this 
      spot in nearly four years. Yeah it's a tough life, standing here all day. 
      Sure... sometimes people are nice enough to give me Shackles of Obedience. 
      But I was wondering... Need a patron?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Gotrok lugians seem to be moving toward the 
      north, and the borders of the Olthoi North.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The wound that 
      struck High Queen Elysa down nearly killed her. But the blow was laden 
      with some mysterious poison, one that attacked not only her physical 
      being, but her spirit also. If she had died she may have been gone 
      forever. Good riddance, I say!&quot;<br>
