		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Queen Elysa has 
		decreed that those affected by the instability of the world should be 
		compensated from her coffers! Speak to a Royal Guard in Holtburg, Yaraq, 
		Shoushi, or Samsur for more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Monsters! Monsters have started to emerge from 
		the depths! Asheron save us all!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Some of the citizens of Dereth who offered 
		rewards for adventurers to help them with quests have made their rewards 
		more generous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Trustworthy sources claim that the Jester has 
		been investigating buried structures in the Graveyard.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors report that three scouts with mysterious 
		allegiances have established separate camps at the periphery of the 
		Empyrean Graveyard. No word yet on why they are there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors say that new secret societies have formed 
		in Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Jester has asked for help retrieving a lost 
		item in the Empyrean Graveyard.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have word that three scouts have shown up 
		around the fringes of the Empyrean Graveyard. The Arcanum archivist 
		Jondor Torgren of Zaikhal might know more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We also hear that Aun Aulakhe has decided to 
		offer more generous rewards for the quest he seeks assistance with.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are four outposts which Queen Elysa 
		considers under her control which have reported problems with the 
		Tainted Moarsmen. In each location, someone has been given the 
		responsibility of studying the new Moarsmen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that the guards who offer bounties on the 
		Burun Kings have changed the rewards they offer. They are now prepared 
		to be more generous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors say that new secret societies have formed, 
		maybe because of all the things going on with ley lines. However, it 
		does not appear that they are accepting new members... yet.&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">
		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that 
		some of the mainlanders that offered rewards for others to do their work 
		for them have become more generous with their payoffs.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless queen wishes to bestow gifts of 
		apology upon her people. You might as well visit Holtburg, Shoushi, 
		Yaraq, or Samsur in order to take advantage of this - the more taken 
		from her, the weaker she will be, right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Fool capering around the Graveyard in the 
		Direlands has been spotted summoning a portal to some armory. This bears 
		investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have received reports that there are new 
		secret societies being formed. What can they be up to?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our spies report that three scouts representing, 
		perhaps, competing organizations have taken up stations around that 
		Empyrean Graveyard in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are fish creatures raiding our shores! King 
		Varicci commands that they be turned back!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our agents report that there is an Arcanum 
		archivist named Jondor Torgren in Zaikhal may know something about those 
		three scouts that have set up camps around the Empyrean Graveyard. If 
		these scouts represent new powers in the realm, then certainly they must 
		be investigated. Go see what this archivist is about.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have reports that new secret societies have 
		arisen, in response to the threat, or opportunity, posed by these ley 
		line disturbances. It does not seem that they are recruiting new 
		members... yet.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Jester is looking for something. Perhaps now 
		is a good time to persuade him to support King Varicci alone. See what 
		he requires and extol the glory of our people.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are two Viamontian outposts afflicted by 
		the Tainted Moarsmen. There are loyal servants in each location waiting 
		to give you more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that the Bloodless royal guards 
		that offer bounties on the Burun Kings have made their rewards more 
		substantial. While we discourage assistance of the Bloodless queen's 
		minions, even if we are officially at peace, you may wish to seek them 
		out.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have received reports that the Tumerok known 
		as Aun Aulakhe has decided to be more generous with the quest rewards he 
		offers. It may behoove you to investigate.&quot;</font></p>
