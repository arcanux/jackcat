		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Festival Season has begun! 
		People are celebrating everywhere by wearing masks and guises.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you like my costume? I made it myself. Well, I 
		had a little help from the Mask Makers in Eastham, Al-Jalima and Sawato.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Scarecrows are back. Every year they show up 
		to protect the pumpkin patches. I wonder where they come from?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh, what a cute costume! That is a costume, 
		right?&quot;<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Town Crier gives you Chocolate Cookie.</font><br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Remember that weird Hollow Minion Mask? Well 
		apparently the Mask Makers can make a Hollow Minion Mask that looks like 
		the real thing now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This year I am going to the Festival Party in 
		Glenden Wood as Mr. P.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Antius commissioned some new magical gems as a 
		reward for something. No one knows why, though.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A penguin with a sweet tooth?&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What is Dereth coming to?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hehe, what are you supposed to be?&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh, sorry. No. No, it looks good on you! Really.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I wonder if monsters like to dress up as humans 
		for the Festival Season?&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;... you are human right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I swear I saw someone with what looked like a 
		mosswart idol mask. I know those Idols don't drop anything but their 
		eyes though. Wonder where he got it? Wish I had one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What's cold and fits on your head? One of the 
		newest masks. I wonder how they keep them from melting?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear a strange pumpkin patch was found just 
		outside Glenden Wood. Not sure what's so strange about it, but this is 
		Dereth, it could be anything, so you better stay away from it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The creepiest mask I've seen so far is the 
		Maddened Fiun Mask. Actually, it makes me a little sad too. Those poor 
		people.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Between you and me, I wish we were doing 
		something about Marae Lassel. When are we going to go on the offensive 
		and take the island back?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you ever notice that the Virindi's Consul 
		Mask doesn't really look all that red? Well the Mask Makers have a new 
		dye that fixes the problem. They say they will exchange the old colored 
		mask for the new one or the new colored mask for the old one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A dark figure has been asking questions of the 
		locals in Qalabar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that Nuhmudira and her student Camryn 
		have been working on a new magical gem. I don't know what it does, but I 
		have my doubts on whether it's a good thing. Not that I'd ever say that 
		to someone who worked for her. You don't work for her, do you?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh, what a cute costume! That is a costume, 
		right?&quot;<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Town Crier gives you Peppermint Monougat Chew.</font><br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Glenden Wood is throwing a Festival Season 
		Celebration. People from all over are going there to show off their best 
		costumes and join in the Festival fun.&quot;</font><p>
		<font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;What's white, fluffy 
		and deadly. That's right, it's the mask you've been waiting for.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh, what a cute costume! That is a costume, 
		right?&quot;<br>
		<font color="#66FF99" face="arial">Town Crier gives you Peppermint Chocolate Cookie.<br>
		<br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;The Bloodless twitter away their time here. Their lowered state of 
		preparedness will be their downfall. King Varicci has instituted a 
		colored coded warning system so that we can be prepared for war at any 
		time.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I suppose I can see the point of gorging yourself 
		on candy and foods in order to store up fat for the coming winter, but 
		what's the purpose of dressing as other creatures? I'll never understand 
		Bloodless customs.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I wish Town Criers could fight more often. I 
		could still inform the masses while slaying the King's enemies!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Uh, here.&quot; <br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Town Crier gives you Viamont Toast. </font><br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Relax and enjoy your festival celebrations 
		Bloodless one.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you think I would look more fierce in an eye 
		patch?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The intrigues of the Bloodless always amuse me. 
		It seems that the one known as &quot;Antius&quot; has been commissioning a new 
		magical gem. You would think he would intend its use against us in the 
		war, but no... he intends it as a reward of some sort. He is a fool.&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The air is getting cooler. That means the Ruschk 
		will be wandering into our territory in the next few months. Hehe, 
		there's nothing like the Winter Ruschk Hunt!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If I were to make a costume. Which I wouldn't, we 
		are talking hypothetically here.&quot; <br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If I were to make a costume you could be sure 
		that it wouldn't be the guise of a silly, white, fluffy, harmless bunny 
		rabbit. No, I would make it from a proper beast like a Doomrock. Am I 
		pronouncing that correctly?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you visited Marae Lassel lately? Things are 
		coming along nicely with the new Viamontian holdings. People are happier 
		to be ruled by a real king like King Varicci.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I believe I saw one of those shadows I have heard 
		so much about. It had dark bat-like wings, the grinning head of a 
		pumpkin and a hook for a hand! A horrible creature to be sure.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word has it that your kind have been disturbing 
		our research in the Direlands. We simply wish to further the knowledge 
		of our people. Why do you insist on pushing our people ever closer to a 
		battle you cannot win. You would do well to stay away from our private 
		works.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I received an odd report that men made of straw 
		and pumpkin have been terrorizing the Bloodless lands. If they can't 
		stand up to some silly straw men then they really are in trouble.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You Bloodless don't understand nobility at all. 
		You call your guild leaders kings and queens when they are neither noble 
		born nor rulers of anything of worth. Then there's that High Queen of 
		yours, merely a common woman with a penchant for bossing Bloodless 
		around. King Varicci will show you what a real King is.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard from someone who heard from someone 
		else that Nuhmudira's student Camryn has a supply of new magical gems, 
		designed to corrupt the so-called &quot;Noble&quot; armor. Good for him. Corrupt 
		all the trappings of the Bloodless, as far as I am concerned.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I met an extremely rude man the other day. He 
		said some things about King Varicci that I would see him tossed to the 
		Eaters for. If you see a scruffy man with a dirty robe and a mug in his 
		hand report him to the authorities at once.&quot; </font></span>
