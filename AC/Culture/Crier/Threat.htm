      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that 
      Lord Kresovus bid the Archmage Kifandal to open a portal to Linvak Tukal 
      at the base of their citadel as a welcoming gesture to his allies.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've noticed that some of the magical processes 
      involving spell-casting have been accelerated. Is it possible that 
      sinister means dwell beneath this newfound power?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
      tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
      information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen what the armorsmiths of the land have 
      been busy making? Neither have I, continued raids from creatures have seen 
      their wares whisked away in the night.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Attention! The Lugian Renegades are continuing 
      their assault upon Linvak Tukal in even greater strength than before. All 
      those who wish to assist our Lugian allies should report to Arutis, the 
      Lugian Emissary in the city of Linvak Tukal!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;An Aun Tumerok claiming to be sent from High Queen 
      Elysa has arrived in Arwic. He's beating a drum at the highest tower.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Fadsahil al-Tashbi seems to have moved out of his 
      old abode. He's not that far from there in a nice tent. Perhaps you should 
      speak with him.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like the rabbits aren't the only animals that 
      have been busy this spring.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh just like everyone else, my advice is only good 
      enough for a paltry amount of pyreal! Well thank you, Mr. Pyrealbags 
      this'll go a long way toward providing for my family. I'm sure that an egg 
      will feed me, my three kids and my wife.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not saying it's true, but rumors that have come 
      to me say that Nuhmudira was recently killed by Oswald.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those creepy little creatures... I cannot believe 
      that the High Queen wants to find out more about them. I say, kill them 
      first and find out what they want when they surrender!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Chiran, Lorica and Nariyid. Those are the new types 
      of armor that the armorsmiths were working on, a pity that they were 
      robbed.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's good to see new life in Dereth. I've seen too 
      much death for too long.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;My contacts told me that old Ulkas in Linvak Tukal 
      has become a master of his craft -- and his creations are even more 
      powerful than before.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Aun Laokhe has traveled to Arwic on a special 
      mission. Apparently he can speak to the spirits of nature that speak truly 
      arcane languages.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ahh! Just this 
      morning on my way to work, I was attacked by a Platinum Golem! After he 
      hit me with a bit of the old &quot;Tusker's Gift&quot; nonsense, I cast a Life Magic 
      dispel to remove the offending enchantment and was quickly on my way!&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;What are those things? They seem to have set up an 
      encampment around that strange temple in the Blackmire Swamp.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like the rabbits aren't the only animals that 
      have been busy this spring.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Apparently Fadsahil al-Tashbi has stated several 
      times, in Council meetings, that there is a fell voice that has been 
      screaming beneath his home. What could that be?&quot; <br>
