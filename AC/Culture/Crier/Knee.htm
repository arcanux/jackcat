		<font size="2" face="Arial"><font color="#66FF99">You give Town Crier 
		5,238 Pyreals.<br>
		Town Crier gives you Violet Ball.</font><br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What's this? You say it's the answer to the 
		riddle, &quot;The answer starts after you...?&quot; After you? Why, after &quot;u&quot; 
		comes &quot;v,&quot; the first letter of violet! That's it!&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Pack dolls! I got a 
		little Bael'Zharon dollie. What did you get?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Whither Nuhmudira? People in high places want to 
		know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friend, who's a wonderful cook, whipped up a 
		batch of field rations for me. A wonderful mix of meaty, nutty, fruity, 
		cinnamony goodness!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! High Queen Elysa is sending out 
		a search party to discover Nuhmudira's whereabouts. All who are 
		interested in participating in this search should report to the Arwic 
		tavern for details.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard the Council of Sages wanted to make a 
		Pack Elysa and a Pack Borelean, but the High Queen said no. I guess they 
		couldn't come to a good licensing agreement!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;By the Black Breath, have you tried the new 
		elaborate mana rations? Their heavenly taste is out of this world! They 
		beat out apple candy by a long shot, in my humble opinion. And they're 
		good for you, too!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Goodness! I never thought I'd have a little 
		Olthoi Queen to call my own. She'll look sharp in my apartment!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey, money! I appreciate it. Your contributions 
		are welcome.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard a secret, but it'll cost you more than 
		that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A wee young girl recently breathed a soft whisper 
		in my ear of a new island discovered to the east. Now, how could such a 
		slip of a thing have come by such intriguing information? And further, 
		how did I become the purveyor of every rumor and tale bandied about by 
		the merest inhabitants of our fair land, content to be reimbursed only 
		by the occasional paltry coin and tarnished treasure? How indeed? Alas! 
		The psychological perambulations of my vocational existence slow the 
		imagination, my friend.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard the farmers tell of terrible portents 
		in our land. Cows refuse to give milk, and the butter never churns. 
		Yeasted breads fail to rise, and the apple cider from our harvests has 
		turned to vinegar. I hear our doom coming, I tell you. Doom.&quot; <br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We haven't heard from Nuhmudira in quite some 
		time. I wonder what she can be up to?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I love the fall season. The smell of pumpkin pie 
		and spiced apple cider waft from the taverns, and the trees adorn 
		themselves with their autumnal shades. The air turns to the slightest 
		bit of chill, and a young man's fancies turn to thoughts of... ahem. 
		Where was I? Ah yes, I love the fall!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Attention! High Queen Elysa needs your help on a 
		mission of grave importance. Her representative is waiting at the Arwic 
		tavern to brief willing adventurers.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey! Did you get a Pack Levistras? My cousin got 
		one and he says it's his favorite, but I really like my buddy's Pack 
		Gaerlan, too!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The winds are changing, and I've got a shiver 
		going up my spine. My gut tells me that the Burun shall strike again in 
		even greater numbers and strength. But when? When?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I just made me a bag of nummy health rations. 
		Delicious!&quot; <br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Shorry, can't talk now. Mowph's full! Rashonsh!&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;An adventurer told me about a puzzle with a bunch 
		of marbles and mislabeled bags. I wonder if that's where all my marbles 
		went...&quot; Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! High Queen Elysa is 
		sending out a search party to discover Nuhmudira's whereabouts. All who 
		are interested in participating in this search should report to the 
		Arwic tavern for details.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The oddest folk come to me in the dark of the 
		night while I'm standing here. One wizened character snuck up behind me 
		and hissed into my ear that a new island has been revealed to the east. 
		I whipped around to confront who had spoken, but slap me now if he 
		hadn't disappeared. Poof! No doubt others will come by to tell me even 
		stranger tales... I get that a lot.&quot; </font>
      </p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;So I'm sure you've 
		noticed that I haven't left this spot in nearly four years. Yeah it's a 
		tough life, standing here all day. Sure... sometimes people are nice 
		enough to give me Shackles of Obedience. But I was wondering...Need a 
		patron?&quot;</font><br>
