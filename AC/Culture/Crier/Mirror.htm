      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Have you been to the island that the Virindi invaded a few years back? 
      No? Well from everything that I have been hearing, the Virindi have fled, 
      and something else has taken their place. Something...not very nice.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm thinking that the island in the southwest is a 
      diversion or something. But don't quote me on that. I've been parked here 
      for over four years, and though I may talk about taking myself out into 
      the wilderness to hunt, I think that we all know that I am more suited 
      toward the art of talking more than fighting.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that an enigmatic sage has moved 
      onto a mountaintop outside of Kara. I wonder if there is any truth to it?&quot;
      <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you're looking for the bracelet that Nuhmudira 
      needed while trying to face down the Olthoi Queen, don't bother with the 
      Singularity Caul. I've been told that the portal is now located on the 
      Obsidian Plains. What caused that to happen?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;My brother said he was standing on the coast south 
      of Ayan Baqur when a bright flash of light rose from the horizon followed 
      by a billowing black cloud. He wasn't close enough to be harmed by it, but 
      I wonder what occurred in the ocean down there.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors are pouring in the the Singularity Caul has 
      been transformed. If the things that I have been hearing are true, portals 
      disappeared and reappeared here on Dereth, the Virindi have shored up the 
      access way with much stronger residents...but...they fled the island. Are 
      they trying to keep whatever is there hidden?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;They say in the Sho city that's rumored to have 
      been an Aluvian settlement a great warrior removed his armor and left to 
      find himself again.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yes, it's true. We saved all of those pyreals that 
      you've been handing to us for years and we finally had enough to buy 
      ourselves a little slice of the world. Now we just need to get more people 
      to take notice. Think you can give us a hand?&quot;</span></p>
      <p><font size="2">Town Crier Tells You &quot; It Blew up! Huge columns of 
      smoke blew into the sky and dropped hot ash from miles 
      around....and....Okay...It didn<span lang="en-us">'</span>t really &quot;Blow Up&quot; it just kind of 
      Imploded&quot;</p>
      <p><font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The undead seem to be armoring 
      up. For as old as it is, their armor appears to have held remarkably well 
      through the ages.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;My little sister tells me that on her recent 
      travels through the Shoushi she ran across several encampments of 
      creatures guarding runed chests. I wonder what's going on?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that a great warrior lost his way 
      in the wilderness. I've also heard tell that he found his way again. It's 
      said that his journey began in a place that bore two names.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that Ecorto has been a little more 
      talkative than usual.&quot; </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;It sat beneath the cover of 
      brush. Stone still, until I approached, then it lunged at me, screaming 
      and taunting me! I nearly died! What was it, you ask? I'm not certain, but 
      it was terrifying!&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that the Virindi have reinforced their 
      hold on the dungeon that leads to the Singularity Caul. Why would they do 
      that?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are you able to recall to the Singularity Caul? If 
      you are, you might consider yourself lucky. I've heard that the island has 
      become much more deadly. What can it all mean?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'll never get to that island in the southwest now. 
      Why do I have to stand here and never hunt?&quot; </font><br>
