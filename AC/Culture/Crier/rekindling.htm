		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear a Colosseum was found west 
		of Yanshi. Some Empyrean Golems have been running it ever since the 
		Empyrean left. Nobody told them to stop. Anyway, fighters from 
		everywhere and some creatures are going there to test their skills. It 
		all sounds a bit too dangerous to me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Now it's easier to keep track of people you 
		don't want to talk to any more!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So, now that all of you stalwart adventurers have 
		found a way to get to Bur, anyone found Asheron yet?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you visited Bur? I've heard that there's a 
		scout who is telling people how to get to previously undiscovered 
		caverns. Who knows what's down there?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there's a mana barrier under the 
		Burun town of Kor-Gursha. I've got no idea how to lower it, but maybe 
		one of the Burun might know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lots of golems around recently. Ayup.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some kind of golem invasion I reckon. Lots of 
		crafters around too.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The upper catacomb sure does have a lot of 
		statues in it, doesn't it? Wonder what they're all for...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;They found a Colosseum near the Abandoned Arena 
		west of Yanshi. Fighters can test their mettle against all sorts of 
		opponents. I think they should have a Town Crier event where the loudest 
		crier wins.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I SURE COULD USE THE REWARD MONEY!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Seems the golems in the Halls of Metos held the 
		secret to golem creation. Now everyone who's anyone has a golem.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Something scared that Burun scout Tmauruk pretty 
		badly. I'd be careful if I were to go into any <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Seems the golems in the Halls of Metos held the 
		secret to golem creation. Now everyone who's anyone has a golem.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yes, I've heard that sages have developed a more 
		efficient way for you to keep track of the people you don't want to hear 
		from any more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard a mage talking about &quot;ley lines&quot;, like 
		they might be important. Don't know anything else, sorry.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have a cousin who has an uncle whose neighbor 
		heard that the Queen and her council all think that Asheron is being 
		held behind the mana barrier, and that finding a way to lower it is of 
		vital importance.&quot;</font><br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Have you heard about the Colosseum? I can't wait to go. I'm sure my 
		people will crush the competition in the arenas. Oh glorious battle! I 
		can smell the blood already!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King has once again neither condemned nor 
		approved of the ventures into Bur. Loyal Viamontian citizens are free to 
		do as they wish.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors of Empyrean Golems being used by 
		Viamontian Crafters are false. Our mages are responsible for these new 
		devices, not the Empyreans.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! It is now easier to track people you wish 
		to ignore! Yes, I realize that is somewhat paradoxical.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard of something called a mana 
		barrier? It's said that the Bloodless are expending all their energy 
		into figuring out how to lower one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Sometimes a statue is a piece of art, and 
		sometimes it can be much more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A path has been opened to a wholly new world, 
		ripe for... exploration. All those loyal to the King should establish 
		themselves there and... explore... what's there to... find&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So it seems that sages have made it easier for us 
		all to keep track of the people whose comments we wish to ignore. Maybe 
		this will help me ignore the high pitched whining of the Bloodless...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty King Varicci declares the use of 
		Empyrean Golems to be a breakthrough in Viamontian Magic! Our most 
		powerful mages have setup golems in the Halls of Metos to provide the 
		benefits of our discoveries to everyone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless put all their energy into freeing 
		this Asheron, but really, what will change when he returns? Will he save 
		them from our advances? When the King decides to advance, the Bloodless 
		and the rebels both will be crushed.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you know what a &quot;ley line&quot; is? I don't, but 
		I've heard them mentioned a few times lately.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a Burun named Tmauruk who is giving out 
		missions on Bur. Might be interesting to see what he wants.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Colosseum is the greatest thing to happen 
		since the development of the flamberge! I once watched the Knight Duval 
		Renari fight three Tremendous Monougas! It was glorious. You should have 
		seen him cut off one Monouga's leg and use it to bludgeon the other 
		two.&quot;</font></span></td>
