      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;They say that there 
		is a temple buried beneath the Blackmire Swamp, I wonder what is in 
		there?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tales that tumeroks are gathering from 
		all directions at a point to the north of Yaraq. No outsiders are 
		welcome near their fire -- what unknown purpose could be so important?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can't believe that Ulgrim killed Nuhmudira... I 
		hear he's on the run from her students now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Mosswarts coming into town and asking for help, 
		speaking Roulean no less. Who would have ever thought?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm wildly speculating, but maybe Ulgrim saw 
		something he shouldn't have. Now he sleeps with the fishes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My Uncle's nephew says that Ulgrim went to live 
		with the Tuskers and learn to throw poo.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;They say that there is a temple buried beneath 
		the Blackmire Swamp, I wonder what is in there?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My sister's best friend's neighbor says that 
		Ulgrim was kidnapped by a Tremendous Monouga.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear Ulgrim has been seen all over the place. 
		It's hard to figure out how he could be in so many places at once.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A mosswart named Grearrk walked into Sawato 
		bawling and bleating. Apparently it found its way into the tavern there. 
		The barkeep knows more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine says that he talked with Ulgrim 
		the other day and he seemed different. He couldn't figure out why 
		exactly.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have it on good authority that Ulgrim was seen 
		at a bar a few days ago. Apparently he was drinking heavily.&quot;.<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Someone saw Ulgrim on a road near Shoushi. I 
		wonder where he's heading.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have it on good 
		authority that Ulgrim was seen at a bar a few days ago. Apparently he 
		was drinking heavily.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Aun Aulakhe has sent word that Portal Space 
		disruptions are causing the very boundaries within it to disintegrate.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;An adventurer 
		traveling through town from the north told me that Celdiseth's tumerok 
		apprentice, Aun Aulakhe, has learned new ways to improve that fearsome 
		Invoker of his.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that Aun Aulakhe, in the Tumerok 
		akiekie to the north, has given his faithful Windreave Saritea 
		permission to trade old Invokers for ones with even more powerful magics 
		than before.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;If I were an 
		adventurous soul, which I am not, I'd be looking arround the Blackmire 
		Swamp for anything out of the ordinary.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you know that 
		they moved us to a new pay schedule? We only get paid once a month, and 
		only on the first day of the month. But I'm expected to be at my post 
		the same amount of hours... Oh sure the town crier is here for you, but 
		where's the love for us, huh?&quot;<br>
