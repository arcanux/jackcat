		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that the people of 
		Cragstone are hiring hunters to kill off some of the flood of Drudges in 
		their town.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Messengers from Cragstone have sent word of 
		Drudges constructing something near their town.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, Hear ye! All soldiers of able body and 
		mind are asked to travel to the town of Kryst, where the forces of New 
		Aluvia stand in defense against an incursion of hostile Mosswarts!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scholars report a strange agitation in the 
		currents of portalspace... What could it mean?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of continued Banderling 
		activity near Ayan Baqur. I wonder if the Guards are going to do 
		anything about it?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Honestly, is anyone shocked that the mysterious 
		gathering of Mosswarts turned out to be a bad idea for Isparians? 
		Probably that incompetent git Hrothgar, but the rest of us weren't 
		surprised.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have reports that the Drudges who have been 
		raiding Cragstone have built a fortification on a hill west of town. You 
		may want to see if you can be of service to the people of Cragstone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine was in Ayan Baqur, and saw one 
		of the Royal Guards working with a Viamontian Investigator. Dereth is 
		indeed full of wonders.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Drudges keep raiding Cragstone for their food 
		and resources. Even with the large contingent of warriors, archers and 
		mages defending the town from the attacks they keep getting through. 
		Jarvis Hammerstone has asked for those willing to help to speak to him 
		about hunting the Drudges.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word from the Arcanum is that there have been 
		disturbances in portalspace, that they think are tied to Virindi 
		activity somehow...&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">
		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;We have it on good authority that the Bloodless town of Cragstone is 
		still under siege by the noisome Drudges. Apparently they cannot defend 
		their town themselves so they wish to hire others to do it for them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty's most learned and powerful sages 
		have reported swirling eddies and odd concentrations in the mysterious 
		realms of portalspace. One wonders what it could portend.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless of Cragstone allowed the Drudges to 
		build a fort right under their noses. Never allow an enemy a foothold!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our noble King has taken an interest in the 
		problems with Banderlings near the Bloodless town of Ayan Baqur. All 
		those capable are encouraged to gather more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, Hear ye! All soldiers of able body and 
		mind are invited to not go to Kryst, where the Bloodless queen has 
		gotten her troops into trouble and now needs to be bailed out... again.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Against Mosswarts!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci is a little concerned. All this 
		agitation among the lesser humanoids like the Banderlings and the 
		Mosswarts... While in public he scoffs at it, but through more discreet 
		channels he's been indicating that if Viamontians want to go and 
		investigate the situation, they are more than welcome to do so.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty's scholars have found disturbances in 
		portalspace. While they have not been able to confirm their findings, 
		they believe this may be the work of some unusual activity among those 
		mysterious Virindi. Should they think to think to take over Sanamar as 
		they took over that cluster of Bloodless hovels in Ayan Baqur, they will 
		find that the people of Viamont are not so easily bent.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our noble and illustrious monarch, King Varicci 
		has sent aid to the Bloodless Queen to help end the mystery of the 
		altered Banderling, 'Harraag'. With a properly skilled Cinghalle 
		Investigator on the hunt in the Bloodless town of Ayan Baqur, there will 
		be answers in no time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A representative of Cragstone has asked for our 
		best hunters to pay him a visit in his hometown. He claims he can reward 
		those who help cull the Drudge population. If you wish to amuse yourself 
		for a time with the Bloodless you should seek Jarvis Hammerstone in 
		Cragstone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty has asked for our warriors and mages 
		who are not currently in service to pay Cragstone a visit. He believes 
		that fighting the Drudges entrenched there will prove educational to our 
		younger warriors who have not yet besieged a town.&quot;</font></span></p></td>
