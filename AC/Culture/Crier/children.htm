		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! The mask 
		makers have decided to make some additional masks this season!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Those strange vendors at the Colosseum, the 
		Empyrean Graveyard, and the Olthoi North have expanded their 
		inventories!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've seen Drudges, Banderlings, even Lugians and 
		Tumeroks warped by Aerbax. Does that mean a human will be next?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Those strange vendors at the Colosseum, the 
		Empyrean Graveyard, and the Olthoi North have expanded their 
		inventories!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that Oswent the Pale seeks further help 
		in his investigations of Linvak Tukal.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's word that some kind of Aerbax-twisted 
		Tumerok is puttering about on the west coast somewhere.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There seems to be some kind of plague afflicting 
		the Carenzi of Marae Lassel...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is word that a Tumerok named Aun Teriona on 
		Marae Lassel seeks the livers of infected Carenzi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about the kidnappings and assaults 
		upon humans? Some people have gone missing. The Queen's agents believe 
		Aerbax is involved...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you got your late-season mask? The mask 
		makers decided to create some more masks, apparently with an adventurous 
		undead theme.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A scholar named Nomea ibn Makar seeks adventurers 
		to aid in the investigation of an Aerbax-tainted Tumerok. Seek him out 
		in Qalaba'r.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you helped Oswent the Pale with his 
		investigation before, he would have your assistance again. You can find 
		Oswent in Cragstone, as before.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that the vendors at the 
		Colosseum, the Empyrean Graveyard, and the Olthoi North have upgraded 
		their inventories with armor upgrades and high quality craft materials.&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">
		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard of 
		some kind of infectious infestation among the Carenzi of Marae Lassel. 
		That would be the actual rodents, and not the foolish band of rebels 
		that resists the Viamontian dominion on that island.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor is that the vendors at the Colosseum, 
		Empyrean Graveyard, and Olthoi North have improved their inventories.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard of no kidnappings among the 
		population of New Viamont. Clearly King Varicci protects his people 
		better than the Bloodless Queen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Most curious. We have heard that Aerbax has 
		twisted and uplifted one of those smelly, savage Tumeroks. Should we 
		worry about its potential power?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Now word is that the mask makers of the Bloodless 
		lands have created an additional set of masks. I am glad our own 
		heritage mask maker is above such frivolity.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless agent known as Oswent the Pale 
		seems to be seeking the aid of those who helped him before.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that the specialty vendors at the 
		Colosseum, Empyrean Graveyard, and Olthoi North have expanded their 
		inventories with armor upgrades and high-quality crafting supplies. We 
		urge you to investigate, as such commodities could be very valuable to 
		New Viamont.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is apparently some ongoing plague among the 
		Carenzi rodents of Marae Lassel. The Tumerok known as Aun Teriona would 
		know more, if you can bear the smell of those beasts.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King's sages have noticed a pattern of 
		Aerbax's abductions and prodigal children. We should be on guard, lest 
		Aerbax try to twist and raise up a human over us.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;New masks from the Bloodless mask makers? I have 
		heard of these, yes. Undead sailors! Who ever heard of such a thing? 
		What foolishness!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you worked for Oswent the Pale in the past? 
		Something about an investigation at Linvak Tukal? If so, he may have 
		need of you again. Report to Cragstone to find him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless scholar Nomea ibn Makar of Qalaba'r 
		is investigating the case of a Tumerok that has been uplifted by Aerbax. 
		One can only imagine what such a beast is like, with such power put at 
		the disposal of a primitive savage. I meant the Tumerok of course, and 
		not this Bloodless scholar.&quot;<br>
