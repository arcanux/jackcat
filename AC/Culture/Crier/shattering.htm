		<font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Woohoo! Lots and lots 
		of money! Money money money!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you gotten your new pack doll? I know he's 
		an avatar of death and destruction and smells faintly of regurgitated 
		blood... But he's just so cute in that little form!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It would seem that there is an apprentice of the 
		Ryu Jou Gai in Sawato. Since when does the Ryu Jou Gai have a presence 
		in these lands? He must be organizing something...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If Dardante is following Grael and Kurth follows 
		Dardante... Oh no.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that Dardante is now under Grael's 
		control. As if he wasn't bad enough before!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Good news! King Varicci and Queen Elysa are 
		cooperating in the effort to fight Grael!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lock your doors and windows tonight. I've heard 
		of towns being attacked by groups of Grael's thralls.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard the scholars muttering about how Grael 
		has a soul split in three, or three souls, or something like that. 
		That's all well over my head.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Apparently there have been Bandits extorting the 
		town of Sawato for quite some time... You might think that someone would 
		have noticed it before now. Good thing that Ryu Jou Gai apprentice is 
		organizing a way to stop the Bandits once and for all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been whispers of less powerful Mukkir 
		appearing near Holtburg, Yaraq, and Shoushi. Has Grael seen fit to 
		target the towns where our newest and most vulnerable comrades first 
		arrive? A chilling thought.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that Grael has a, ah, what was 
		the word? A tripartite soul? Whatever it is, hopefully people smarter 
		and braver than me will figure out some way to use this knowledge 
		against him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It sure was a pleasant surprise, to see the token 
		for the Grael pack doll just show up in my things. I got my doll. I'm 
		not sure if I want to trade it in now for immediate power, or save it 
		and auction it off at the Marketplace in a few years when their value 
		has gone up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have a friend who just came through the 
		portals, and I was ready to console him for coming to Dereth at such a 
		troubled time, but he's actually quite happy. It seems he is just 
		rolling in pyreals now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is news out of Sanamar that the King is 
		most angry with his former advisor, Count Dardante. It sounds like 
		Dardante left the King's service and has given himself over to Grael. 
		Looks like Dardante was just looking for a more powerful patron.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tread carefully around towns. I hear tell that 
		Grael's armies are attacking the towns of our fair, if troubled, realm.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems King Varicci and Queen Elysa are 
		cooperating with each other to defeat the terrible threat posed by Grael 
		the Heart-Render. Good for them, I say. I hope the peace will last 
		beyond the fight against Grael. That is, if we survive that fight...&quot;</font>&nbsp;<hr width="65%">

		Rumors</font></span></b><p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells 
		you, &quot;We shall fight Grael to the end. What a glorious battle that will 
		be!&quot;</font><p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;There are rumors of less powerful Mukkir appearing near the arrival 
		towns on the mainland. Investigate them if you care. Despite our 
		detente, I do not much care about what happens to Elysa's subjects.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King's forces have been quite busy defending 
		our land against Grael's warriors. Keep an eye out for any incursions 
		and report them to your local guard.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell that there has been something going 
		on in Sawato. Maybe you should go investigate.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports of newcomers to Dereth arriving 
		from Ispar with a great deal more pyreal wealth than the earlier 
		arrivals made due with. Lucky for them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;That traitor Dardante has fallen under Grael's 
		power! The King will not let this stand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scholars say that Grael has three souls. Or is it 
		that his soul has been split into three pieces? The details seem mostly 
		academic to me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yes, I've seen those Grael pack dolls. I do not 
		think it was wise of that foolish old drunk to start handing out toys 
		shaped in the form of our greatest enemy, but his actions have never 
		made sense to me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Count your blessings, Bloodless one. The King has 
		decreed that all his loyal subjects should focus their hostility on the 
		threat of Grael instead of on our conquest of the mainland.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King has declared his former advisor, Count 
		Dardante, to be a traitor. The treacherous Count Dardante overstepped 
		his bounds and gave himself over to the dark influence of the 
		Heart-Render. Woe to the false counselor! May the wrath of all true 
		Viamontians fall on his head!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yes, it seems new arrivals are being blessed with 
		a surfeit of riches. More pyreals than they know what to do with. I 
		would be envious of them, except that they are also entering this world 
		at a truly perilous time, and no stack of coin will help them with 
		that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Count your blessings, Bloodless one. The King has 
		suspended all hostilities against your kind so that we may work together 
		against the demon Grael. I blame Count Dardante for this!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ware the towns, friend. Even the mighty walls of 
		Sanamar may not protect you if Grael's soldiers of darkness come. Be 
		prepared to fight at all times.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports of dens of less powerful Mukkir 
		near the Bloodless arrival towns of Yaraq, Shoushi, and Holtburg. 
		Ordinarily, I would merely laugh at the tribulations of the Bloodless, 
		but they are officially our allies now, and it might do for new arrivals 
		to seek out these dens and build their strength against the minions of 
		Grael.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard tell from those who study the arcane 
		that Grael's soul is quite unique. It has three parts. Such matters are 
		beyond me, but perhaps one of the King's sages will find some way to use 
		this knowledge against the Heart-Render.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ah, yes, the Grael pack doll. It seems useless 
		and very inappropriate at first, but it seems that they can be traded in 
		for personal power and advancement... Most interesting, yes?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ha! It would seem that Sawato is having some sort 
		of Bandit trouble. That kind of thing would never be allowed to happen 
		in Viamontian territories. Maybe you should go help them out, well all 
		know that Bloodless Queen will not.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Regrettably, the King has declared a moratorium 
		on hostile actions against the minions of the Bloodless Queen. We have a 
		stronger foe to fight.&quot;<br>
