		<font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Finally, the casinos 
		have moved closer to town! I was worried about those guys. They provide 
		such a valuable service to the people of Dereth. But they've been out in 
		the wilds for so long. No shelter, no food, no.. you know, the more I 
		think about this, the more this all sounds a little familiar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yesterday, my daughter and I were walking through 
		the marketplace when she saw what she claimed to be the most beautiful 
		dress ever. Now I have to figure out how to make it for her... kids... 
		sheesh!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some young man just told me that the Banderlings 
		of the Direlands have started an underground Niffis-fighting ring. Do 
		those damnable Banderlings have no sense of decency at all? My word.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard that portals to Power Forges have been 
		discovered on the shores of the Inner Sea. What mysteries like within 
		their depths? Only time will tell.&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tanami Kei needs your 
		help! Poor man, last I heard of him, he was drowning his sorrows in the 
		bar in Ayan Baqur...&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;At long last, the 
		Agents of the Arcanum have expanded the list of items they will accept 
		in exchange for housing writs! I might be able to finally buy that 
		cottage I've had my eye on!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Elysa's council is all abuzz about those new 
		islands to the north of the Beach Fort. Where did they come from? Why 
		have we not seen them until now? If we only had a boat...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So many masks have suddenly become available! I 
		know which one I want to collect to round out my collection!&quot;</font></p>

		shelter, no food, no.. you know, the more I think about this, the more 
		this all sounds a little familiar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some people ask me where all the new portals in 
		Shoushi, Holtburg, and Yaraq came from. To them I say, Dereth is a land 
		of change.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some young man just told me that the Banderlings 
		of the Direlands have started an underground Niffis-fighting ring. Do 
		those damnable Banderlings have no sense of decency at all? My word.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I used to think that Marsh Siraluun claws were 
		only good for some mundane items. Boy! Those Aun in Bluespire sure 
		proved me wrong!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;New mysteries lie beneath the waters of the Inner 
		Sea. Could they be of benefit to our people? Or do they only promise 
		untold horrors? Inquiring minds want to know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Few things crush the spirit more than the theft 
		of your intellectual property. Just ask Tanami Kei, in Ayan Baqur.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Like my new finery? Isn't it fabulous? I bet you 
		wish you could have one too!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So many masks have suddenly become available! I 
		know which one I want to collect to round out my collection!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that some new artisans have moved to 
		Bluespire. They don't appear to be as eccentric as the ones in Glenden 
		Wood, but I have never known the Aun to be that odd anyway.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;They say that Asheron went back home. I can't 
		wait to see what he does, now that he's in control of the place.&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine 
		strolled by earlier with a pack full of odd weaponry. They definitely 
		looked tumerok in design, but what they were capable of was simply not 
		what I expected.&quot; <br>
