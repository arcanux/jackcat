		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of Raven Hand 
		sightings in the northeast of Osteth. I wonder what they are up to now?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Shadow Spire has been spotted in the 
		Singularity Caul. The Shadows may be getting too comfortable down 
		there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been ominous rumors that the 
		Viamontian wizard, Count Dardante, is up to something...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell there's more activity among the 
		Whispering Blade, and that they seem to have turned their attention from 
		Varicci to Grael. I can't get into their chapterhouse, though, so I 
		can't be sure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Essences have arrived at Yanshi!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been ominous rumors that the 
		Viamontian wizard, Count Dardante, is up to something...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard tell that a new shipment of more 
		powerful Runed Weapons has been looted from Varicci's vaults, and is 
		turning up again in well-guarded treasure chests...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have been named the Speaker of my allegiance! 
		Watch what you say, or I'll gag you!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that the Whispering Blade has 
		changed its priorities. They used to think that Varicci was the biggest 
		threat to the realm, but now it's all Grael all the time with them! They 
		seem to be particularly interested in the Raven Hand's attempts to wake 
		or summon the ancient barbarian.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are several rumors of the Raven Hand 
		digging in the northeast of Osteth, near the shore closest to Vissidal 
		Island. Whatever it is that they are looking for, it can't bode well for 
		the rest of us.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that Count Dardante is working 
		on something particularly nasty, and that there are other forces besides 
		the Whispering Blade and Queen Elysa who seek to stop him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I fear the power that the Harbinger may have 
		acquired from the Essences.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friend found another Runed Weapon, more 
		powerful than the last, but he wouldn't tell me where he got it. I think 
		he was doing some super-secret work for the Whispering Blade when he 
		found it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell that monarchs have been given greater 
		power over the structure of their allegiances!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that Isin Dule is responsible for the 
		Shadow Spire that has risen in the Singularity Caul. I hope he stays 
		down there.&quot;</font></p>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;King Varicci requires all able-bodied men, women, and children to 
		travel to the ruins of the Bloodless town of Yanshi and fight the 
		creature that dwells beneath.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;More Runed Weapons have been stolen from the 
		royal vaults, this time a set of weapons more powerful than before. This 
		is intolerable.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that the monarchs of the realm, who are 
		all subject to His Majesty King Varicci, of course, have been given 
		greater latitude to protect their allegiances from interlopers and to 
		appoint officers to aid in management.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our own Count Dardante has been a very busy man. 
		Our King is fortunate to have such a learned and tireless servant in his 
		employ.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scouts reported a strange twisting tower in the 
		Singularity Caul. They also report that powerful Shadows attacked them 
		there. We've had the scouts detained, for spreading lies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Bloodless dog, if you had any instinct for 
		self-preservation, you would throw in your lot with His Majesty King 
		Varicci, especially in light of what the Rossu Morta is doing...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been reports of an old Bloodless death 
		cult, called the Raven Hand, searching for something in the northeast of 
		Osteth. This should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard quite a few things about Count 
		Dardante and his ambitious plans. I hope the man is not wearing himself 
		out. There are also reports that his activities have drawn the interest 
		of parties once thought neutral in this clash of kingdoms...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that the monarchs of the realm, who are 
		all subject to His Majesty King Varicci, of course, have been given 
		greater latitude to manage their allegiances and to appoint senior 
		officers. This is welcome news if it serves to help us better organize 
		our war effort.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are several reports of an old Bloodless 
		death cult, called the Order of the Raven Hand, digging on Osteth, near 
		the shores of Vissidal Island. Along with this, there have been reports 
		of increased &quot;Shadow&quot; activity in the same area. Perhaps those loyal to 
		Sanamar should investigate.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that some more powerful Runed Weapons 
		have been stolen and released from the royal vaults. Even worse, we now 
		hear reports from the Rossu Morta themselves that some of their agents 
		on particularly sensitive missions have turned up caches of these 
		weapons in enemy hands...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports of a floating tower, twisting 
		in the skies above the Singularity Caul! Be warned, King Varicci will 
		not stand for the spreading of lies and fear-mongering.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci has hinted that he wishes to weaken 
		the Harbinger in order to capture it and yoke it to his will.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are you one of the rare Bloodless who has proven 
		his worth to the Ordina Rossu Morta? If so, you should report to the 
		Chapterhouse and see what service your King requires of you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard quite a few things about Count 
		Dardante and his ambitious plans. I hope the man is not wearing himself 
		out. There are also reports that his activities have drawn the interest 
		of parties once thought neutral in this clash of kingdoms...&quot;</font></span></td>
