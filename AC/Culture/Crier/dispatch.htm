		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that 
		a pair of scouts have appeared in Wai Jhou, asking questions about 
		Rytheran...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a scholar seeking 
		information on the Green Mire Warrior.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that Harlune has picked up and left 
		the Mite Maze, though he still maintains a residence there. It might be 
		worth finding out what's going on down there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors that people have found 
		something new of Lilitha's.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If your Soul Bound Staff or your Soul Bound 
		Atlatl is broken I hear the Jester can fix them for you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Someone told me the Jester is collecting some 
		sort of crystal sphere for something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a scholar seeking

		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that Roderick, the bodyguard in the 
		Mite Maze who's watching over Harlune's business, has some shady 
		ties...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard from Eldrista the Adventurer that the 
		bows Lilitha made that people collect from Hunter's Leap have changed. 
		Perhaps someone in there found a new stash of bows Lilitha left there?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ivory Crafters around Dereth have placed new 
		importance on the High Acolyte's Skull, and are offering larger rewards 
		for gaining one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Jester has placed a few Summoning Stones in 
		the Graveyard. I suppose he got depressed hanging out in a Graveyard all 
		day.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that two mysterious strangers in Wai Jhou 
		seek adventurers to go after the undead lord Rytheran. Even more 
		interesting, these mysterious strangers are not friends with each other 
		at all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My uncle told me he ran into a scholar in Shoushi, 
		seeking people to go into the Green Mire Grave to retrieve the Green

		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard 
		reports that Ivory Crafters have rethought their rewards for a certain 
		skull artifact. This may be worth investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have reports of young adventurers finding bows 
		of unusual strength somewhere between the Bloodless towns of Holtburg 
		and Glenden Wood.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that a pair of strange scouts 
		have taken up residence in the Bloodless town of Wai Jhou, seeking 
		information on the undead lord known as Rytheran.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Graveyard's Fool continues to flaunt his 
		power. Watch him closely to ensure that the mainlanders do not tip the 
		balance of power in their favor.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;An informant told me the Jester will fix a Soul 
		Bound Caster or Soul Bound Atlatl if you have a problem with one of 
		them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that Rytheran has become interested in 
		the works of the Falatacot. Interesting, no?&quot;<br>

		seeking information on one of their long-dead heroes, someone they call 
		the Green Mire Warrior.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've received reports of several adventurers 
		entering the dungeon of Hunter's Leap finding bows that are both easy to 
		wield and powerful. It may be of benefit to our King for these bows to 
		be collected.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have several reports of a Bloodless Scholar in 
		Shoushi, sending adventurers into the Green Mire Grave to retrieve 
		weapons and armor for him to study. It may be worth your while to 
		retrieve these things for use in battle yourself.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our scouts report strange new Summoning Stones in 
		the Graveyard. Please investigate them.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have reports that two representatives from 
		rival hidden factions are stationed in Wai Jhou, recruiting adventurers

		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Remember the Blood Witch Numuhdira who was 
		assisting His Majesty during the war? Apparently she's dispatched agents 
		to Bur to investigate something.&quot;</font></p>
