		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Reports are sketchy, 
		but apparently Viamontian Knights have been seen in the hills around 
		Stonehold. Now that they've taken Marae, I imagine Stonehold is next on 
		their list.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Explorers have reported that a new island has 
		risen from the deeps of the ocean! Wooo, the mystery!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;They came without warning. The cities of Redspire, 
		Greenspire, and Bluespire were lost within an hour of the assault. The 
		Queen is huddled with her council. I do hope she comes up with some sort 
		of plan.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have to admit, I am a bit relieved knowing that 
		we Town Criers are no longer the only ones in the business of accepting 
		worthless junk!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have often wondered, do all of the Duke's 
		relatives share his philosophies? Are they all rebels, or do some of 
		them still follow their king?&quot;</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town 
		Crier tells you, &quot;Reports say the new island is called Vissidal Island, 
		a name bestowed on it by the Empyrean race who lived there before.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tale the new island's not for everyone. 
		Apparently it is filled with strange and powerful creatures, and it's 
		quite difficult to gain access to the portal that leads there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin went to the new island and he came back 
		with an odd-looking hand weapon...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hope the Carenzi Rebels can hold out a little 
		longer! My cousin sent them some food...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about Branwyn and Geowulf? It 
		seems as though they had a fight. Geowulf stormed out their home and 
		hasn't been seen since! I met them once at a social at the Haliana 
		settlement. They seemed so happy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Fantastic news for those who have had some of 
		their favorite pieces of housing decor ruined by the unseemly weather of 
		this world! The Arcanum has sent skilled refurbishers to the towns of 
		Shoushi, Yaraq and Holtburg. I hear one of them tried to offer her 
		services to the Viamontians of Sanamar, but was turned away at the 
		gate.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Reports say the 
		new island is called Vissidal Island, a name bestowed on it by the 
		Empyrean race who lived there before.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard there are some youngsters who have 
		taken to the hills on Marae and are fighting the Viamontian invaders! My 
		heart goes out to those poor young souls.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Poor Branwyn. Ever 
		since her husband's disappearance she hasn't left that lonely cottage of 
		hers.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh no. You cannot 
		be serious. Those Mosswarts on the new island cannot possibly worship 
		HIM.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard there is a group of intelligent 
		Mosswarts living on the newly risen island. I have to wonder how they 
		got to be so much smarter than their mainland cousins.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard the stories of the beast they call 
		the Leviathan? Large as a house they say. Most dreadful.&quot;<br>

		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="arial">Marae Lassel Rumors</font></span></b><p>
        <font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is there is a settlement of 
        &quot;civilized&quot; Mosswart things on the newly risen island. Uncouth little 
        beings, they are. I wonder who taught them to speak and reason?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is talk of a newly discovered land, risen 
        from the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what secrets have been dredged 
        up from the deep?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;As soon as we find out where they're hiding, our 
        soldiers are going to crush those Carenzi Rebels.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some over-confident Bloodless sought to ply her 
        trade within the walls of our fair city, but the Royal Guards would have 
        none of it and turned her away from the gates.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;We fell on their forces like a plague. The 
        Bloodless cities of Marae Lassel are ours!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Victory is ours! All hail King Varicci!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those fools who call themselves the Carenzi 
        believe they are safe from the justice of the King. Well I have some 
        advice for them: &quot;Always watch your back.&quot;&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum thinks that we, the proud and noble, 
        would accept their offering of refurbishment. Their agent thought she 
        could waltz right in here and start repairing things she says are 
        broken. We need no help from the Bloodless to repair trinkets and 
        baubles! Leave such trifles to the Thrungum!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scouts report that the creatures of the new 
        island are especially dangerous. Be careful if you head out in that 
        direction. That is, if you are strong enough to make it there.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Surely you can spare more than that. Do I look 
        like a common beggar to you?&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Pathetic Bloodless coupling 
        falls into shambles! Bloodless Flourist suspected of murdering her 
        wretched husband! Well... that is my account of it anyway.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those young rebels must have some measure of 
        courage, standing up to our King's armies the way they are.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that the newly risen island is 
        called Vissidal Island, which is the name given to it by its ancient 
        inhabitants, before it sank beneath the waves.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Lugians of Geth Tukora have been unusually 
        active of late. I hear they've expanded their ruined quarters. If they 
        keep this up, we'll have to drop the Eaters on them once again.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those who delight in pugilism might be interested 
        to know that adventurers have returned from Vissidal Island with a 
        powerful, if oddly constructed, new hand weapon.&quot;</font><br>
