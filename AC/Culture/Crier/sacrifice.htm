		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Part of me wishes to say that 
		Kurth got what he deserved, but...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a memorial to Antius near Yanshi. I'm 
		planning to go visit and pay my respects, as soon as I'm off duty.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		own Crier tells you, &quot;I hear there is a recall on those faulty Glenden 
		Wood Recall Orbs. People are tired of portaling into Glenden Wood and 
		finding all their muscles in a painful state of rigor. You can turn the 
		orb in for a spell scroll with Tomo Genza.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know, I think I've been pursuing the wrong 
		career all this time. I think I'll learn how to swing a sword properly 
		and take the fight to Varicci myself!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell there's some kind of ghost haunting a 
		ruined temple in the northeast, near the coast...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The brave citizens of Yanshi have rebuilt their 
		town! It's quite impressive.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I love this time of year. Everything looks so 
		white and pretty...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;All right, I'm sick of the cold now. How long 
		until it gets warm again?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have to weep whenever I think about poor, brave 
		Antius. No, I won't weep. I can be strong for the Queen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Viamontians are still at Glenden Wood! What more 
		could they want?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that people are finding it much easier 
		to pick up new skills, within reason. That's good. A mind that stops 
		learning is a mind that's started dying, I always say.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a running rumor that claims Ulgrim has a 
		secret hatch on one of his islands. There is no truth to this rumor, 
		it's a dirty lie perpetrated by Ulgrim himself. Don't listen to that 
		man, he spins falsehoods and untruths wherever he ends up deciding to 
		drink for the month.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't get it. Elysa sent a Royal Guard to 
		Yanshi, but she couldn't help out Kurth, and now Kurth is... Well, let 
		us not ever speak of that man again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Glenden Wood is still standing even after the 
		attack. I hear that an archer has been organizing a counter-attack 
		against the Viamontians, too.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't even have to look at the snow to know 
		that winter is here. These days, when I leave my cottage, I get attacked 
		by Snowmen instead of Scarecrows. Ah, the turn of the seasons...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Glenden Wood is still standing even after the 
		attack. I hear that an archer has been organizing a counter-attack 
		against the Viamontians, too.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I urge you to go to Yanshi and pay your respects 
		at the memorial to Antius. He was a good man. Is that what the 
		Viamontians have been after? A way to well and truly kill someone? It 
		was bad enough thinking Nuhmudira and Oswald had that power, but now 
		this mad bull King...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that people are finding it much easier 
		to pick up new skills, within reason. That's good. A mind that stops 
		learning is a mind that's started dying, I always say.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't even have to look at the snow to know 
		that winter is here. These days, when I leave my cottage, I get attacked 
		by Snowmen instead of Scarecrows. Ah, the turn of the seasons...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So there's this ghost at a ruined temple up 
		north. I hear tell the temple is inhabited by Shadows! It's been a long 
		time since Shadows really made a ruckus. I hope the appearance of this 
		temple isn't some kind of dire sign...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The citizens of Yanshi have rebuilt their town, 
		stronger than ever, but there's still trouble brewing down there... 
		That's why Elysa stationed a Royal Guard in town.&quot;</font><br>
