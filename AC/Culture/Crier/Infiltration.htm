		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;What's the story behind these 
		Banished creatures? They sure sound scary to me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I was speaking with a Lugian friend of mine the 
		other day when he mentioned something about a great disturbance. He 
		refused to elaborate, though I plied him with enough ale to drop a 
		horse.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Queen is looking for help in finding out how 
		Carlo di Cenza found his way to Dereth. Talk to Antius Blackmoor in 
		Yaraq if you wish to help!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Last month I found what I thought was the most 
		powerful sword I have yet come across. But this month, I found an even 
		better one! This a good time to be a hunter!&quot;<p>
		<font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Queen is greatly disturbed by 
		the recent attack on the Royal Vaults. She fears we may not have heard 
		the last of these mysterious Lugians.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The wind from the north grows cold. I fear a 
		storm may be on the horizon.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can't wait to put this back together!&quot;<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">The Town Crier produces a handful of some 
		blackened mineral.</font><br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Wait, you can't have this! It's mine! If you want 
		some for yourself, you'll have to get it on your own!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Has it really been a year since poor Samuel was 
		discharged from the Royal Guard? I would like to say Eastham was better 
		for it, but... well... Sam hasn't done much outside of drink.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who is this Sezzherei I keep hearing about? And 
		what does he want with the Caul?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you found them yet? Those Singularity Caul 
		reliquaries I keep hearing about? I hear people have found some strange 
		items in them!&quot;</font><p>
		<font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you stand on the northern 
		shores and listen closely enough, you can hear the screams of war. What 
		madness makes its home up there? And when will it find its way to our 
		lands?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lord Kresovus has put out a call for help. The 
		Queen offered her aid, but he said he would rather seek assistance from 
		independent adventurers. I wonder what that's all about?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you found them yet? Those Singularity Caul 
		reliquaries I keep hearing about? I hear people have found some strange 
		items in them!&quot;</font><p>
		<font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;My good friend Loh-Gann Huhjj 
		found a page from Carlo di Cenza's journal on the beach near the 
		northern Beach Fort. It appears to be part of a much larger work. I sure 
		hope he finds all the pieces. I am very interested in this Viamontian's 
		past.&quot;</font><p>
		<font size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who is this Sezzherei I keep 
		hearing about? And what does he want with the Caul?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine was hunting the Singularity Caul 
		when he came across a powerful new creature. It was a tough fight, he 
		said, but he got a nifty spear out of the deal.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The vendors in Shoushi, Yaraq, and Holtburg must 
		have benefited from those newly relocated casinos. They seem to have 
		several more pyreals in their possession than usual.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So, Samuel in Eastham claims to have some sort of 
		new wonder drink! He says it cured him of his nightmares. So, I went to 
		the Singularity Caul, got some of those bits he makes the drink from, 
		and gave them over... Can't say that it did much for me outside of 
		clinging to my throat on the way down...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Has that 50,000 pyreal piece of armor been 
		cluttering up your house chest for too long? Well, go to Shoushi, Yaraq, 
		or Holtburg and sell it!&quot;<br>
