		<font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Festival Season 
		celebrations will be held late this year. Feel free to celebrate, we 
		just won't have any festivities planned until later.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I figured out how that Ust thing works so now I 
		can salvage all the junk people keep giving me!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! The Master Craftsmen of Glenden Wood have 
		sent their journeymen out into the world. All those who wish to further 
		their artisanal skills should contact the journeymen to discover what 
		new crafting tests are available.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;When I put a full bag of salvage in the Ust, it 
		drops right though now, rather than clogging up the whole operation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear that Shoushi had some bad storms recently. 
		I know we all wish them and their families the best.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye! Hear ye! I plan on leaving town and 
		raising chickens.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Burun have unearthed another ancient 
		structure. This one can be found in the direlands. Oddly, their Renegade 
		allies have not been spotted in the area.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've beaten back one of the Burun leaders. 
		Clearing up the rest of them shouldn't be that difficult.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I never knew the Ust could do so much!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears as though a schism has grown in the 
		ranks of the Burun. After Morgluuk's defeat, a good portion of the Burun 
		fled the wounded leader. Apparently his weakness gave rise to a fear 
		that the Guruk would soon crush the Ruuk and so a great many of the Ruuk 
		have joined with them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;In my free time I've been undergoing the tests 
		set forth by the Journeymen craftsmen. I'm well on my way to becoming a 
		skilled cook! And my purse is filled with pyreal as well.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Spies inside the Renegade camp state that the 
		remaining Burun allies that they have are leaderless and have come to 
		admire the Renegades free will. However, the remaining forces are too 
		small to mount a potent resistance against our forces.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Wow, can you believe it's been almost five years 
		since all you heroes started showing up? Time flies when you're having 
		fun!&quot; </font>
