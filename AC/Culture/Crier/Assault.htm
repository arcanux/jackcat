		<font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Royal Vaults have 
		been attacked! Royal Guard Tirenia is looking for help! Go! Go now!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Mmmm, nothing like some traditional black-eyed 
		peas to celebrate a new year!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Go to Holtburg! Royal Guard Tirenia needs help!&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Queen doesn't much like these Crafting 
		Forges, from what I hear. She spoke with her Lugian allies, and they 
		have never heard of Kerrak, Amaroth, or Urleg. I fear what evil we might 
		have unleashed here. But at the same time, I do enjoy the improved 
		salvaging!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A blue-skin! In Rithwic! I thought we fled those 
		animals years ago!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friends in the Dereth Exploration Society tell 
		me they just found a new cult full of some fairly noxious creatures. I'd 
		tread lightly out West, if I were you.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Town Crier community is all abuzz. We haven't 
		seen a blue-skin since we left Ispar! Where did he come from?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I love fireworks, but be careful when you set 
		them off! You could lose an eye... or worse!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who is this Einrik Gaul character? And what gives 
		him the right to lead, I ask you?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My patron just told me she can hook a whole slew 
		of new portal artifacts to her mansion. Is Nuhmudira back on the Queen's 
		payroll?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Drudges out West must have gained access to 
		some Intelligence-boosting magic. I had no idea they were capable of 
		such mechanical feats.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;In an effort to drum up business, the healers in 
		Shoushi, Yaraq and Holtburg are now offering attribute enhancement 
		spells up to level four!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Agents of the Arcanum have expanded the list 
		of items they will accept in exchange for Housing Writs. I hear the list 
		is so long now, they're handing out the list on paper. I guess their 
		lips were getting chapped!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'd be wary of Cyphis Suldow if I were you. Seems 
		like a shady character to me.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear the healers in Shoushi, Yaraq and Holtburg 
		are offering new services.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like I'm going to have improve my 
		sword-fighting abilities. I just found a great new sword when I went 
		hunting the other day, but I don't think I'm quite skilled enough yet to 
		use it.&quot; </font>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard from one 
		of the guards that a Drudge broke into Elysa's study, but they weren't 
		too concerned.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine saw this huge, ugly thing 
		floating above Ayan the other day. He said he heard it meow, if you want 
		to believe that.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Cyphis Suldow is recruiting adventurers to clear 
		out a camp of Banderlings so he can build a resort. Can you think of 
		anything more despicable?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin was out hunting Drudges the other day. 
		He said he saw a group circled around one Drudge who was holding a 
		parchment. He swears they were actually giggling!&quot; </font><br>
