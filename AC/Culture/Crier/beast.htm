		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;A new portal has 
		appeared somewhere on the Vesayen Isles. It may have to do with the Deru 
		tree.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A mysterious portal has appeared near the Deep. 
		Who knows what horrors exist within?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've heard that a group of Tanada assassins has 
		issued challenges to other great warriors.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that there are human bandits in northern 
		and southern Osteth prowling around ley lines and nodes...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hoshino Kei has moved into Asheron's Tower. It's 
		said that she is engaged in an important research project.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems new Virindi structures have appeared in 
		the Obsidian Plains... Do they have something to do with Aerbax?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;New Olthoi Cavern up in Olthoi North, I've heard. 
		A normal one, this time, not a weird Paradox one, so it's said.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Nomendar al-Rakh, a geomancer in Sawato, is 
		looking for people who've had encounters with those ley line bandits in 
		the north and south of Osteth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hoshino Kei is researching the Quiddiy Ingots 
		which Asheron has extracted from Aerbax's Quiddity Seeds.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about the group of Tanada and 
		their challenge to the other bandits of Dereth? It is said that their 
		champion bears a wondrous sword... Invitations to this fight are hard to 
		come by, though. You have to take them by force, it seems.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a well of blood within the Trial of the 
		Deep. The dark purpose of such a thing is unknown.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems like the new Olthoi Sanctuary might have 
		been trapped away for some time. Perhaps it's comparatively untouched by 
		Aerbax's little trick last month?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those great floating Virindi structures over the 
		Obsidian Plains are definitely the work of Aerbax. It seems as though 
		all his machinations with his Prodigal Children are coming to a head...&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">

		Obsidian Plains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard reports that a champion has arisen

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our man on the Dark Isle reports that a new 
		portal has appeared next to the Deep.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those loyalists seeking to make a name for 
		themselves may try to fight the monsters in the Olthoi Sanctuary.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's more going on in the Olthoi Sanctuary 
		than meets the eye - a Bloodless sorceress named Hoshino Kei has taken 
		interest in it for some reason.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's said that if you enter the Trial of the 
		Deep, you will encounter many monsters that typically serve the 
		Falatacot. However, there are no actual Falatacot in the Trial of the 
		Deep.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Although I hate to admit it... there's a 
		Bloodless wench named Hoshino Kei who can probably identify your 
		Quiddity Ingots for you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there's a well of magical water

		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've received reports of secret installations in 
		the north and south of Osteth that are built on geomantically active 
		nodes. Seek out a Bloodless geomancer in the swamp hovels of Sawato for 
		more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is some kind of would-be champion among the 
		Tanada assassins who has issued tournament invitations to other bandits 
		of the Bloodless lands. Find an invitation and take this champion's 
		sword for the glory of New Viamont.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The floating complexes over the Obsidian Plains 
		must be part of the final movements of the crazed Virindi Aerbax. He 
		must no longer be content to harry the Bloodless Lands with his twisted 
		Prodigal offspring.&quot;</font></p>
