		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Mosswarts seem more 
		active than usual lately. Guard Hrothgar has been looking into it - he's 
		based out of Cragstone, if you have information for him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Spring has sprung and all the flora and fauna of 
		the world rejoice. Myself? I'm just glad I don't have to cocoon myself 
		in heavy blankets every night. When is someone going to start making 
		windows for our houses?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin was telling me about rumors of some 
		strange, glowy Banderling being seen in the Dires.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like the nice weather has gotten to the 
		Drudges. They've gone a bit loopy and started raiding Cragstone, taking 
		anything they can get their grubby little hands on.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there is even more activity afoot 
		in that strange, ancient graveyard in the Direlands...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a mysterious fellow in Cragstone named 
		Oswent who's looking for powerful adventurers to help him on some highly 
		sensitive mission...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Of all things, there are now rumors that some 
		kind of merchant has moved into the ancient Empyrean graveyard in the 
		Direlands!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like Spring is really here now. I keep 
		finding little nippers all over the place. I even found a Gnawer 
		Shrethlet in my clothes hamper this morning. For some reason he was 
		eating my socks!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard several rumors about a strange 
		Banderling being sighted in the Dires. I've heard that a Royal Guard has 
		been sent to Ayan Baqur to Investigate.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin said that the Drudges near Cragstone 
		have been shouting &quot;Bone Crunch&quot;. The general consensus is that &quot;Bone 
		Crunch&quot; is some leader-type Drudge who's been riling the rest of them 
		up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a man named Oswent in Cragstone who's 
		looking for very powerful adventurers to assist in an investigation. I 
		hear tell he's only speaking to people who helped disrupt that big nasty 
		Falatacot ritual on Bur, though...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A giant Mosswart was seen talking with Bleeargh 
		one night.&quot;</font><br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;There are reports of further unrest among the, ahem, inhabitants of 
		that ancient graveyard that was recently discovered in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless city of Cragstone is suffering a 
		plague of Drudges. Perhaps we should show them how real warriors take 
		care of pests.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've received reports of a strange, glowing 
		Banderling being seen in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Bloodless spy named Oswent has been making 
		discreet inquiries for the services of very powerful adventurers. 
		Perhaps something to investigate? Keep your loyalty to King Varicci 
		quiet, if you choose to speak with this Aluvian. No need to risk our 
		precious detente over a mere investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Mosswarts have been streaming to the Vesayen 
		Islands of late - there's a fort constructed by those useless creatures 
		now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It looks like the local wildlife is in the grips 
		of their reproductive cycle. In a few months the hunting should be very 
		good indeed.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have reason to believe that an agent of the 
		Bloodless Queen named Oswent is in Cragstone, seeking powerful 
		adventurers to assist him. But apparently he will only speak with those 
		who went to Bur and disrupted the blood witch ritual to sacrifice 
		Asheron.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Even further news from the recently uncovered 
		Empyrean graveyard in the Direlands - now there is some kind of merchant 
		there, seeking to barter rare items.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci has announced a nationwide day of 
		fun and leisure. Unfortunately it was yesterday so get back to work, you 
		slacker!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;On our island of Marae Lassel, it's said that a 
		large Mosswart went to speak with Hagra, but was not well received.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been several reports of a strange, 
		glowing Banderling being sighted near the Bloodless town of Ayan Baqur, 
		in the Direlands. This should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our scouts have found an area west of Cragstone 
		that the Drudges have been clearing. Our tacticians believe they are 
		entrenching themselves in order to lay siege to the city.&quot;</font></span></td>
