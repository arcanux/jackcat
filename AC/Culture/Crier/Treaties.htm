      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;An adventurer has 
		decided to make his home in Candeth Keep. There is something not quite 
		right about him. Be careful if you decide to accept his task.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Not too long ago, some of my fellow criers and I 
		spotted Fanzen San returning from a trip to the Vesayen Islands. I 
		wonder what he was doing out there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that there are some frightening 
		new discoveries outside of the southern edge of the Valley of Death. I'd 
		find fellows to travel with if I were to head out there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You would think with the disappearance of Sir 
		Candeth Martine that the Virindi loyal to him would have dispersed. You 
		would think that at least. But rumors persist that they are still about 
		and have moved the location of the Black Dominion to the southern land 
		bridge.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that a group of adventurers 
		unearthed a temple filled with mu-miyah and other undead.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've found Lin to be quite agreeable as late. 
		Everything just seems much more-- right.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that people have found some new breeds 
		of Moarsmen. They must be stealthy creatures for us not to have seen 
		them until now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've often thought about the fact that we poke 
		about in the graves of others. It's kind of morbid when you think about 
		it, you know? But if you ask me... those undead should be looked after. 
		They use evil magic after all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I stopped by the pub in Kryst a few days ago. 
		There were some interesting rumors floating around the bar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen more colors of the Singularity weapons 
		than I have ever seen before. Must be something to do with those Virindi 
		still loyal to Sir Candeth Martine.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;To the south of the Valley of Death there is a 
		small swamp that is kept in the crux of a group of hills. You can get 
		into this swamp but cannot get out. I've heard tell that the adventurer 
		in Candeth Keep visited this area. He claims to have lost something 
		there, but I have a feeling that he'd found something that he couldn't 
		handle.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;More of those 
		filthy Burun have been spotted outside of Yanshi. Fortunately they have 
		been found without their new Renegade allies&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I just heard the oddest rumor. Apparently an old 
		man has moved into a tower on the Direlands side of the inland sea and 
		claims to hold a dark secret about archery. I wonder if it's true.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My little brother visited the Vesayen Islands not 
		too long ago. He said that some of the places he used to go were overrun 
		by Moarsmen!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen more colors of the Singularity weapons 
		than I have ever seen before. Must be something to do with those Virindi 
		still loyal to Sir Candeth Martine.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lin has received some attention from the High 
		Queen. But as soon as the changes were finished more creatures became 
		interested in the town. Why does that keep happening? For instance, the 
		golems in the burial ground have pounded down some walls and extended 
		their caverns.&quot; <br>
		<br>

		small swamp that is kept in the crux of a group of hills. You can get

		in Candeth Keep visited this area. He claims to have lost something

		They use evil magic after all.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		The town crier mumbles, &quot;Idols, blood and dark magic. How can any of 
		that be related to archery.&quot;
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh hey! You gave me money. Oh never mind what I 
		was talking about... it was all tied to that crazy old man living on the 
		inland sea.&quot; <br>
