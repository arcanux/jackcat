		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors 
		that the Arcanum is rewarding adventurers for small glands collected 
		from those eerie Paradox-touched Olthoi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;They should make those new Colosseum Coins out of 
		chocolate! That way you can eat them if you don't want to buy the 
		overpriced stuff they sell. Oh, did I mention that there is a new form 
		of currency you can earn in the Colosseum?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! There are rumors of zombie unrest in Al-Jalima!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The good... well, sort of good... news is that 
		Claude's back. The bad news is that... well, maybe you ought to go see 
		for yourself.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some Aun Tumeroks will give you a little money 
		for gathering something called 'atuakeh'.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Glenden Wood awaits the re-appearance of 
		the Majestic Pumpkin!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's that time of year again! The leaves are 
		turning, creatures are shifting from their summer coats to their winter 
		coats, and the crafters of Dereth are turning creature parts into the 
		most intriguing costumes...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you got your mask yet? I'm a particular fan 
		of the undead sailor mask. Two outfits for the price of one!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Atuakeh can most easily be found north of 
		Marescent Plateau.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's said that Aun Kelauri knows an additional 
		use for atuakeh.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Besides the annual long-awaited appearance of the 
		Majestic Pumpkin in Glenden Wood, there are also rumors that a new 
		Pumpkin Golem has arisen in the Colosseum to test challengers.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a Gharu'ndim in the camp over the 
		Paradox-touched Olthoi area who is bartering items in exchange for small 
		glands from the infected Olthoi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Townsfolk in Qalaba'r, Wai Jhou, Candeth Keep, 
		and Ayan Baqur are offering bounties for Virindi of all shapes and 
		sizes! How timely!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Interested in Claude's new condition? Talk to 
		Leopold for a little more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you're into hunting zombies, I'd keep an eye 
		on Al-Jalima. Shucks, you'd almost think that town was built on an 
		ancient Empyrean burial ground or something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you get the chance, try and get into the Night 
		Club. It's a great way to celebrate the anniversary.&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">

		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are new 
		items to be acquired in the Colosseum. Apparently Gladiators can earn 
		Colosseum Coins and buy all sorts of junk with them. I don't care about 
		the junk, but we need to have more of it than the Bloodless.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've still got better archmages than the 
		Bloodless, but it seems their wayward Virindi archmage has returned.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard reports of a Bloodless collector 
		trading items for small glands retrieved from those strangely touched 
		Olthoi in the north of the Bloodless Lands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that the Bloodless cravens in Glenden 
		Wood are getting ready to abandon their town once again to this 
		ridiculous Majestic Pumpkin.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Let the scaly dogs up on our plateau have all the 
		weeds they want - the plants are useless anyway.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are new items to be acquired in the 
		Colosseum. Apparently Gladiators can earn Colosseum Coins and buy all 
		sorts of junk with them. I don't care about the junk, but we need to 
		have more of it than the Bloodless.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports of undead unrest in the 
		Bloodless desert town of Al-Jalima.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Several notables on the mainland have let it be 
		known that they will reward people for hunting Virindi. Go seek them out 
		in the Bloodless towns of the Direlands if you are curious.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We cannot allow the Bloodless warriors prove 
		themselves superior in the Colosseum. I know the very thought is 
		laughable, but they gain more of those Colosseum Coins every day. Insure 
		that King Varicci can be proud of those who fight in his name. Acquire 
		more Colosseum Coins than the Bloodless!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Not only have the credulous citizens of Glenden 
		Wood given in once again to their yearly pumpkin hysteria, but now there 
		are claims that a Pumpkin Golem now stands against all challengers in 
		the Colosseum. Really, now! This is too much!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So I have heard that you can now get a cow mask, 
		or even a whole cow costume, from the mask crafters of the Bloodless 
		lands. Is this some gutless ploy of the mainland weaklings to mock our 
		well-beloved Red Bull of Sanamar? Or are they really foolish enough to 
		want to dress up like cows?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless town of Al-Jalima seems to be under 
		attack from undead forces. Are these zombies related to the unrest in 
		the Direlands graveyard? Or is it just another case of Bloodless 
		superstition run amok?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't know why the Bloodless persist in 
		allowing monsters to staff their shops, but you can ask the monster 
		known as Leopold about the monster known as Claude...&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Sclavus? They're different.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I doubt there will be much of reconnaissance 
		value to be found, but it may be worthwhile to scout out this Night Club 
		dungeon we've been hearing about. If you can get a ticket, that is. And 
		maybe, if you have a spare, you could get one for me. Not that I'd be at 
		all interested in visiting a monument to the mainlanders' decadent 
		folly.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Want to pick weeds? North of Marescent plateau is 
		the place to go.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The dirty Tumerok known as 'Kelauri' supposedly 
		communes with spirits using the atuakeh plant.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have several reports of a Bloodless collecting 
		small glands from the 'Paradox-touched' Olthoi in the north of the 
		Bloodless Lands. He has set up in the encampment placed there by the 
		Bloodless Queen.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Four individuals, in the towns of Wai Jhou, Ayan 
		Baqur, Candeth Keep, and Qalaba'r, are offering bounties on a number of 
		different types of Virindi.&quot;</font></p>
