		Drudge invasion around Cragstone is finally settling down.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about the Blight tainting those 
		six geomantic nodes around Dereth? There is a surveyor in Ayan Baqur who 
		knows more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors are that some Falatacot patriarchs are 
		running amok.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's been a lot of movement around the keeps 
		of the Moarsmen. I think something's happened.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's been a lot of movement around the keeps

		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Royal geomancers report that six nodes around 
		Dereth have been tainted with T'thuun's blight! Creatures on landscape 
		around each node have been tainted, as well. There is a geomancer named 
		Laedron in Ayan Baqur who knows more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Now it seems that some of the Moarsman raids upon 
		our lands are being led by vile Falatacot patriarchs. Isn't that odd? I 
		thought the Falatacot were ruled by matriarchs...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Scouts confirm! Drudges around Cragstone have 
		stopped their invasions of the town, and have pulled back to defend 
		their gains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know who has a lot of interest in the 
		Blighted Moarsmen? There's an old ex-mariner named Captain Warner who 
		lives in Tou-Tou. If you find out information about the Moarsmen, he's 
		as good a choice as any to take a look at what you find.&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">

		word that powerful patriarchs of those debased Falatacot are loose in 
		the land.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The outposts at Redspire and Eastwatch report 
		increased activity around the Moarsman keeps. Servants of the crown 
		should endeavor to help now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that various nodes, or crossroads 
		of magical energy, have been tainted by some ancient Derethian demon. 
		Even one on our own Halaetan Islands. Seek out a surveyor employed by 
		the Bloodless queen in the town of Ayan Baqur.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard that the six tainted nodes around 
		Dereth are under assault by an ancient force of corruption, and have 
		even tainted some of the creatures that live near each node. In this 
		case, it may be prudent to help the Bloodless queen and the wizard 
		Asheron in their defense of the realm. Seek out a surveyor named Laedron 
		the Geomancer in Ayan Baqur.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard reports that patriarchs of the

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh ho! So the Bloodless of Cragstone have finally 
		put down the Drudge invasions of their pathetic cow town! I suppose they

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there's a dirty Bloodless pirate
