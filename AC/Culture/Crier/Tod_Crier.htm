		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The rebel wench 
		Eleonora thought she could slay the King as she did his brother. Now her 
		heart rests in the dungeons of the Ferran Torturers. Such is the price 
		of defiance.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Fiun on the northern shore of Vanguard Isle 
		have aligned themselves with the rebels of Silyun. Do they truly believe 
		their feeble alliance stands a chance against the power of Sanamar?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Newcomers to Dereth may wish to speak with Elena 
		du Furza or Lorca Sammel. Those two always seem to need some sort of 
		assistance.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are looking for some sort of task to 
		occupy your time, you would do well to speak with the barkeeper, Vaden.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;When we first arrived on this land, a great red 
		bull stood atop this plateau. We took that bull's presence as a portent 
		of great things. We quickly established the city of Sanamar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless Queen shall soon know the might of 
		Viamont. You would do well to align yourself with our glorious King.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are looking to prove your loyalty to the 
		King, speak with the Grand Knight.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you spoken to Rand yet? He makes the most 
		incredible brews!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King has recently perfected his extraction 
		technique on the Fiun. The Eaters will soon be unleashed on the lands of 
		the Bloodless. And when that happens, there will be no stopping the 
		ascension of Viamont!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Thrungus of the surrounding forests have been 
		stealing from the King's own quarters! If you have some time on your 
		hands, go out and slaughter a few of those vile creatures. Such crimes 
		must not go unpunished.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you tested your abilities against the 
		maddened Sir Bellas? From time to time, we like to enter his dungeon and 
		torment the crazed rebel. Unfortunately, you have to deal with Fiun 
		Scorus in order to gain access to that dungeon. But it's a small price 
		to pay for such wonderful sport!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The outpost of Westwatch is well-suited for new 
		arrivals. The outpost of Eastwatch serves as a base of operations for 
		only the hardiest of warriors.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Need a vassal? I won't ask for much just some 
		tinkered armor and maybe a tinkered weapon. Oh and maybe a few MMD trade 
		notes, or maybe some golem hearts, wasp wings, armoredillo spines, 
		lugian sinews, dark revenant thigh bones, full sturdy iron key rings, 
		full singularity key rings, or anything else that you don't need.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some of the creatures you hunt will drop special 
		items, such as beaks or claws. You would do well to see if the Collector 
		has need of those items.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The outpost of Westwatch is well-suited for new 
		arrivals. The outpost of Eastwatch serves as a base of operations for 
		only the hardiest of warriors.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Sanamar contains several portals to the cities of 
		the Bloodless. We encourage our citizens to venture into those portals 
		and learn the layout of the rest of Dereth. That information may well 
		prove important to us in time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Lugians of Geth Tukora met their doom when 
		the King unleashed his Eaters upon them. They still make their homes 
		deep beneath the Isle of Ruin. If you are up to the task, you should 
		venture out there and remind them just who rules the surface of these 
		lands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Surely you can spare more than that. Do I look 
		like a common beggar to you?&quot;</font></p>
    <hr width="60%">
      	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;As I understand 
		it, King Varicci has declared Sanamar open to all heritages, though his 
		brutish Knights will slay any they come across in the wilds, blue-skin 
		or no.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hope the Queen has a plan. She'll know what do. 
		Won't she?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;When the barrier around the Halaetans shattered, 
		there was a crash that knocked me to the ground, and a great wind rushed 
		down from the north. I must confess, I feared it was the second coming 
		of Bael'Zharon.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;As I understand it, King Varicci has declared 
		Sanamar open to all heritages, though his brutish Knights will slay any 
		they come across in the wilds, blue-skin or no.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We town criers owe a debt to Brayden Von Grohl 
		for saving one of our fellows from that vicious Eater attack. Sure, 
		we're all lifestoned, but who wants to meet their end - however 
		temporary - in the belly of an Eater?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Viamontian raids have been nothing more than 
		exploratory probes up to this point. We thought their attacks scattered 
		and random. But now it appears they were just testing our defenses all 
		along.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Zaikhal has long been a center of knowledge and 
		learning in Dereth. If the Viamontians take that city, I fear they will 
		plunder its libraries as they have long plundered the libraries of 
		Tirethas.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Where is Asheron when you need him?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Shadow Lugian threat seems to have 
		dissipated. The Lugians of Linvak Tukal are most grateful for the 
		assistance we gave them. I hear they even presented a special war bow to 
		Queen Elysa as a token of thanks.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The rebels of Silyun may be aligned against King 
		Varicci, but they're still just as haughty and imperious as any 
		Viamontian I've ever met.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Where did Carlo di Cenza go? Perhaps he went back 
		to the Halaetans to help his fellow rebels in their struggle against 
		Varicci.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hope the Queen has a plan. She'll know what do. 
		Won't she?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;As I understand it, King Varicci has declared 
		Sanamar open to all heritages, though his brutish Knights will slay any 
		they come across in the wilds, blue-skin or no.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Antius Blackmoor seeks brave warriors to aid him 
		in the defense of Zaikhal! Seek him out! The fate of our realm is at 
		stake!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;As I understand it, the Viamontian Anton Sillezi 
		seeks to create a trade agreement with the merchants of Shoushi, Yaraq, 
		and Holtburg. Is this some underhanded plot of Varicci's, or are the 
		merchants of Sanamar breaking ranks?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;At first, I thought the Thrungum were the cutest 
		little guys I'd ever seen. But a faceful of acid certainly cured me of 
		that thought.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The portals to the Halaetan islands can be found 
		in Shoushi, Yaraq, and Holtburg. The King of Sanamar allows all 
		heritages to enter Sanamar, though the Queen's Royal Guard are slain on 
		sight.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard a secret, but it'll cost you more than 
		that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I know what you are thinking. You want to enlist 
		in the Queen's army against the Viamontian threat. I feel the same way. 
		But the Queen has declared that she will not strengthen her forces as of 
		yet. Perhaps she seeks some alternate method of dealing with this foe.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey, money! I appreciate it. Your contributions 
		are welcome.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Finally, I can make my own beer! If you see Rand, 
		tell him I just love his Amber Ape!&quot;<br>
