    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Town Crier tells you, &quot;The pollen was not so bad.&nbsp;
    My counterparts from the Sho and Aluvian lands must have weak constitutions.&quot;<br>
    </small><br>
    <small>Town Crier tells you, &quot;High-ranking monarchs have been approached by an
    unknown presence and subjected to grueling tests on a distant island.&nbsp; Apparently
    this entity, whatever it is, does not think much of our monarchs.&nbsp; Might this have
    something to do with the frightful apparition in the lightning flashes?&quot;</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The shadow spires have appeared in the vicinity of these
    towns:&nbsp; Eastham, Cragstone, Tufa, Khayyaban, Tou Tou, and Sawato.&nbsp; There are
    rumors of a few others out in the wilderness, all just as quiet and inactive.&nbsp; What
    purpose they serve or will serve is not yet known, though some have been said to have been
    within them.&quot;</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just between you and me, I remember the sun being brighter
    long ago, before the sudden winter.&quot;</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yesterday I found a Wool Fez of Willpower!&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Town Crier tells you, &quot;A renaissance in metallurgy!
    First there was the rediscovery of Lord Atlan's weapon technology! Now, the master
    armorers in al-Jalima, Eastham and Kara have found ways to utilize shadow and crystal
    items.&quot;</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;But between you and me, they are very touchy! They will only
    make one suit of armor of a particular quality for you. They will make another of
    different quality without complaint, but if you ask for a suit similar to one they already
    gave you, they become very rude! </small></font></p>
    <i><p></i><small><font face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Three new Festival
    Grounds have been created for the enjoyment of all athletically - inclined people of
    Dereth. They are near the Wintersebb Festival Stone east of Qalaba'r, the Leafcull
    Festival Stone west of Yanshi, and the Leafdawning Festival Stone west of Rithwic.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! The heritage groups have published a book on weddings,
    available at scribes. Despite the ominous atmosphere, love is in the air, and people are
    getting married. The resilience of life is amazing.&quot;</font></small><i><br>
    <br>
    </i><small><font face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you noticed the changes in
    the sky? Though all is peaceful now, some say the distribution of monsters has changed:
    perhaps they sense a coming storm. But the rabbits seem to be reproducing as usual, so the
    storm must be a ways off yet. Thank goodness!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Ominous floating monstrosities have appeared all over
    our island! Many people are holding their breath waiting for something to happen, but
    there is no sign of activity. Some even say they are empty. Magical experts have
    determined that it is unlikely that the strange spires pose any immediate threat.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;These dark spires loom quietly for now, and experts agree they
    do not pose any immediate threat. However, I heard a rumor that some people are being
    taken inside of them and subjected to strange questions. What power can play with mortals
    like this?&quot;</font></small><p><small><font face="Arial">Town Crier tells 
    you, &quot;</font></small><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">The Great 
    Sage, Aleister the Loquacious, has published a treatise on fused gems. He 
    certainly earned his name. He is quite long-winded, and very full of 
    himself, to boot.<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span> <br>

    dratted pollen has finally subsided! I can breathe freely once again!<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>

    Drudges now look somehow more...menacing?&quot;</font></small><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller"><br>
    <br>
    </font><small><font face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;</font></small><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">Books 
    are now available at the capital cities' scribes that detail scholars' that 
    detail scholars amazing discoveries about the strange crystals that have 
    been acquired from the shadows and the remnants of the Great Work.<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span></font><small><font face="Arial"><br>
