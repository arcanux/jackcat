		<p>
		<font size="2" face="Arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Gabrielle, in Rithwic, 
		seems to have been given new orders. I only know what I hear.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A vile smell has risen from the Blackmire swamp. 
		People in Sawato have made mention that there is something growing in 
		the old Sclavus Fort there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;All the capital cities are abuzz with activity. 
		Even Linvak Tukal and Timaru have seen arrivals of representatives of 
		the Queen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News from Uziz is that Gersan, Gervena and Gerlok 
		have been a bit busier recently.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just a little while ago, my cousin asked me to 
		put an apple on my head. I did, and he promptly ran off a bit and 
		produced a Weeping Bow and shot the apple off of my head. I've never 
		seen an arrow fly so fast or straight before!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that a lugian Captain has been put in 
		charge of collecting some information for the High Queen. Why do we 
		really need their help?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I think when I get some time off, I will take 
		some time to look around Al-Jalima. I've seen and heard tell that the 
		High Queen has had emissaries passing through the area recently.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard that someone from the Royal Guard has 
		appeared in Dryreach! Maybe they are there to liberate that poor, 
		forgotten town?&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors are coming in 
		that the Gotrok and Renegade Tumeroks are doing something in the eastern 
		direland swamps. I wonder what they are up to...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You feel an extra weight in your backpack. It is there momentarily and 
		then disappears.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It must have been a Burun. Anyway, have a good 
		day.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A few reports have floated in about the Hollow, 
		Phantom, and Weeping ranged weapons. It seems that a modification made 
		to these weapons has rendered them capable of releasing their arrows, 
		bolts, and darts at incredible rates of speed.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;All around Al-Jalima there has been a quiet calm. 
		The High Queen called for a bit of aid to the village and aid came for a 
		time. But it seems that the creatures of this world are learning that 
		the aid will eventually wane, and they creep ever closer to our cities.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Gersan, Gervena and Gerlok have been talking 
		about working with the crystals found in the dungeons that held... 
		well... Asheron's enemy at bay. It seems that they've been able to 
		refine and improve their processes. Oh, and did you know that another 
		portal appeared to one of the dungeons along the edge of the inner sea? 
		Fancy that, eh?&quot;<br>
		<br>

		The High Queen called for a bit of aid to the village and aid came for a 
		time. But it seems that the creatures of this world are learning that 
		the aid will eventually wane, and they creep ever closer to our cities.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard of Captain K'rank, but what I have 
		heard is rather foolish. Seems that at one time he was a bit of stickler 
		about clothing, yelling out insults to those that wore unmatched 
		clothing. Silly Lugian. Now it appears that he is organizing some sort 
		of fact gathering missions.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you think that the Burun are looking for ways 
		to bring more of them to this world? Maybe you should wait until you've 
		been to the latest find in the Direlands. But you didn't hear it from 
		me.&quot;</font></p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;My feet hurt. My head 
		aches. My nose itches. My eyes are watery. My tummy hurts too. I need a 
		vacation.&quot; </font>
      </p>
		<p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The fort in the 
		Blackmire swamp seems to be complete. There is no way inside, at least 
		not that can be seen and Burun line the walls. The Renegades have left 
		but the hulking Burun have taken their place. Then of course, there is 
		the smell.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I don't know about you, but I feel awful bad 
		about disturbing the crypts of those sleeping undead. Dericost, 
		Falatacot, either way, it is just not right.&quot; </font><br>
