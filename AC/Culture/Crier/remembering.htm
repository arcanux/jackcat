		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Explorer Society has 
		reported finding a Strange Temple that seems to have recently risen in 
		the Direlands Swamps.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Le-Ai Rea has finally caught on that the Focusing 
		Stone is worth something, and it only took him five years.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been disturbing whispers about a 
		strange temple in Blackmire Swamp that demands a blood sacrifice from 
		all entrants...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm really starting to worry about Asheron. It's 
		not like him to be gone so long.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My witless cousin was found stumbling around Ayan 
		Baqur the other day. He was so inebriated he could barely speak. It 
		seems he challenged Ulgrim to a Drinking Contest. The fool, he's lucky 
		to be alive.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that there is some kind of home 
		facility for those Nanjou Shou-Jen in the southern mountains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum has asked that any Empyrean or 
		Falatacot Trinkets found be turned in to them. People are speculating 
		that some creatures unearthed a very old hoard of the objects. They have 
		been turning up in some dangerous areas lately. The Arcanum is prepared 
		to reward Writs of Refuge for your cooperation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Mask Makers put their heads together to 
		create new Heritage Regalia!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Explorer Society has enlisted the help of a 
		member based in Ayan Baqur to investigate those Strange Temples in the 
		Direlands Swamps.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I thought the note we found in Asheron's Sanctum 
		said that he would return soon. He's been gone an awfully long time 
		now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey, money! I appreciate it. Your contributions 
		are welcome.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Mask Makers have figured out how to craft 
		Virindi Desecrator Masks into a new set of Heritage Regalia. Bring one 
		to your favorite Mask Maker today!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that there is some mysterious entity 
		in the swamps of Blackmire called the Soul Hunter who may be involved 
		with Asheron's long absence from Dereth... There is some kind of tracker 
		in Sawato who is investigating that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friend just told me. The Department of Fish 
		and Games has announced that the High Stakes Gamemasters at the three 
		houses of chance will be taking the recently discovered Empyrean and 
		Falatacot Trinkets in exchange for a spin of the Wheel of Knowledge. 
		Sounds exciting, doesn't it?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know who'd probably be very good at working 
		with shadow-tainted items? Sarkin Killcrane.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that some intrepid explorers have 
		uncovered the Tanada training school in the southern mountains... Speak 
		with Sayuji Jina in Shoushi to learn more.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I didn't know Piersanti Linante had a brother. 
		And he's on the other side of the civil war, too. I've heard he does an 
		augmentation which creates a gem similar to Asheron's Benediction.&quot;
