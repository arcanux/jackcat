		<font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about 
		some kind of portal to Bur being opened? I didn't know such a thing was 
		possible!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of shadowy statues to 
		Bael'Zharon seen in the Valley of Death.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors that more Nanjou Shou-Jen have 
		been seen in the mountains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! All fighting men and women of 
		brave spirit are asked by Queen Elysa to assist her son, Prince Borelean, 
		in opening a portal to Bur! Interested parties should go to Cragstone 
		when the summons is sounded!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So... Should we be gearing up to fight Burun now? 
		Or are the Burun our allies?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's so cold out.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I sure could use a tropical getaway...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Whatever awaits on Bur, it might be a good idea 
		to stock up on Burun-slaying weapons like the Regal Weapons. Haven't got 
		a Regal Weapon yet? Speak to Guard Audrey in Arwic then.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Some orbs being prepared for 
		Prince Borelean's portal summoning ritual have been stolen by Falatacot. 
		If you wish to help, please go to the portal summoning site in northern 
		Osteth and inquire with Hoshino Kei.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that Queen Elysa and Ben Ten herself 
		are involved in this effort to free Asheron from Bur. No doubt, when 
		they find out a way to get to Bur, they will need brave adventurers to 
		go there...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Nanjou Shou-Jen have been seen in the high 
		mountains of Northern and Southern Osteth. I wonder what they're out 
		there for.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Can you imagine what it would be like on Bur? I 
		bet there will be all sorts of interesting things to see and do on 
		Bur... I wish I could go! Even if it is certain peril!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard from several people that they've 
		encountered shadowy statues of Bael'Zharon in the Valley of Death. From 
		what I was told, when touched, several defenders came out to protect the 
		statue.&quot;</font><br>

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;A 
		new world? Sounds like an opportunity for us to extend the borders of 
		the realm of Greater Viamont.&quot; </font></span><p>
		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;I've heard strange reports of 'Shadows' erecting statuary in a place 
		called the 'Valley of Death'...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'd like to see a special battle between King 
		Varicci and that old matron Elysa. I bet she wouldn't last three minutes 
		in the arena with him. Hrm... A battle arena... There's an idea...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;What of you, Bloodless dog? Do you intend to go 
		sniffing after that bumbling wizard on whatever distant realm he's 
		managed to get himself stuck?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard reports of Bloodless assassins roaming 
		through the snowy mountains. I wonder if they're hunting for something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We must be prepared for a potential threat from 
		the frog-creatures called the Burun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;After some deliberation, King Varicci has decided 
		to humor the Bloodless wench and her yapping dog son and not bar 
		Viamontian citizens from participating in opening a portal to Bur.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been several reports of Bloodless 
		assassins moving in small hunting parties through the Northern and 
		Southern Osteth Mountains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been several reports of magical, 
		shadowy statues to a 'Hopeslayer' being found in the Valley of Death. 
		Reports indicate that the statues are being defended if touched, so be 
		warned if you go to investigate this.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So it's true. The fool Asheron went to Bur to 
		help some ridiculous frog-things. And now the Bloodless queen intends to 
		rip open a portal to Bur and send help to find him. I have to think that 
		even with the present truce between King Varicci and their weakling 
		Queen, the Bloodless will end up destroying themselves without our 
		assistance.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ah, Bloodless dog, if your Queen does manage to 
		open a path to Bur, you may want to wait until brave and powerful 
		Viamontians have pacified the dangerous realm for you. We wouldn't want 
		you to hurt yourself searching for the fool Asheron.&quot;</font></span><p>
		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;Should the Bloodless succeed in opening a path to that world of Bur, it 
		would behoove us to send loyal and brave Viamontians there to claim the 
		land while the Bloodless are busily chasing the fool Asheron.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci is amused that the Bloodless have 
		lost their magical orbs. Help the Bloodless if you wish - it does not 
		impact Viamont either way.&quot;</font></span><p>
		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;His Majesty King Varicci II deems it wise to make sure all of Viamont's 
		loyal warriors are equipped with Burun-slaying weapons. I have heard 
		that 'Regal' weapons bear this property. The Bloodless Guard Audrey in 
		Arwic may have some information on that...&quot; <br>
