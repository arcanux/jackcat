		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Another Festival Season is 
		here! Thank goodness we were able to deal with Grael.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Rumor has it that the alchemists of the 
		realm have made breakthroughs in their gem-creation techniques!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of the Ruschk further 
		organizing, and beginning to seek aid against the Viamontians in the 
		Valley of Ruin.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I just saw someone run by who had their head 
		turned into a Shadow!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those darn Pumpkin Buffers are back. Give them a 
		whack for me. They can be found in Shoushi, Holtburg, Yaraq and even 
		Sanamar, as well as the original spawning ground of Glenden Wood.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a Viamontian Mask Maker 
		beginning to produce Regalia, like the ones our Mask Makers craft.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Happy Anniversary! Have you gotten a sparkler 
		yet? It makes me feel so festive!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Be careful out there. I've been receiving reports 
		from adventurers that the dead are rising from their graves. Haha! 
		People love telling spooky stories around Festival time! Everyone knows 
		that the dead hang out in ancient dungeons.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear that the Fiun Speaker at the Fiun Outpost 
		is looking for people to help him investigate Lunnum's Disappearance 
		again. I thought we already found the guy who did it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We all know that undead exist, but did you know 
		that people who were killed before they could lifestone have become 
		zombies? Mindless undead haunting the places they were buried. It gives 
		me the creeps.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Due to recent breakthroughs, alchemists 
		should now be able to use Hyssop to fortify alchemical crucible 
		solutions and turn them into gems endowed with the most powerful known 
		spells.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard stories of people finding new heads 
		that the Mask Makers can turn into costuming for the Festival season.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear rumors that a certain high level mage may 
		have been implicated in the odd corpse theft the Fiun are complaining 
		about.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you like my costume? I just threw it together 
		this morning. You have to have a costume for Festival Season.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Viamontian crafter in Sanamar has begun to 
		craft Regalia from Virindi Masks, like those crafted by the Aluvian, 
		Gharu'ndim, and Sho crafters.&quot;<br>
		Y<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Happy Anniversary! You know, I've heard that the 
		famous Night Club is open for business, but just for a limited time, and 
		only for those who can find a ticket...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Several adventurers have reported that there are 
		Ruschk approaching those in the Valley of Ruin, which is in the Halatean 
		Isles, for aid against the Viamontians.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;</font><hr width="60%">
		<p><font size="2" face="arial"><b>VIAMONTIAN<br>
		</b><br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The crafting of Viamontian Regalia has begun. 
		Show your pride in the glory of Viamont!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless have been seen running around with 
		sparkling sticks to celebrate some anniversary. They seem to be in quite 
		a festive mood. Not to mention this odd Night Club dungeon that seems to 
		have opened up...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Another of these ridiculous Bloodless festivals 
		is here. They even snuck one of those annoying candy filled 
		monstrosities into Sanamar!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Why is there a floating pumpkin in Sanamar? We 
		should salt the earth there or something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is news that alchemists have developed new, 
		advanced techniques to infuse their gems with more powerful spells.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I do believe I just saw a ghost come by... Are we 
		on good terms with the Undead now?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Why is there a floating pumpkin in Sanamar? We 
		should salt the earth there or something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Who cares about body thieves? We have more 
		important things to consider than who took some moldy corpse from the 
		Fiun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is news that alchemists have developed new, 
		advanced techniques to infuse their gems with more powerful spells.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Viamontian Forces in the Valley of Ruin are 
		seeking aid against the rapidly organizing Ruschk forces there. 
		Exterminate the brutes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;One of the noble craftsmen in Sanamar has 
		mastered the art of crafting Regalia from the masks of certain Virindi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;That Fiun, Layeel, at the Fiun squatter camp 
		seems to think we should help him find there missing dead. Bah!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless Mask Makers are turning more 
		creature parts into 'costuming'. The Bloodless have the strangest 
		holidays... I can see celebrating by hunting dangerous beasts, but then 
		wearing those creatures as disguises to mug people for candy?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that the alchemists of the realm have 
		perfected a way to imbue their gems with the most powerful known 
		spells... Involving the humble herb Hyssop.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A party of Viamontian Hunters, with the King's 
		sanction, have begun rewarding those who aid them against the Ruschk in 
		the Valley of Ruin.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I say we dig up all the dead and stick them in 
		some dungeon. Then we can send our convicted felons there. It'd be 
		cheaper than maintaining those royal torture chambers full of Eaters.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's an orange menace! It's a blight on our 
		King's shining glory that is Sanamar! Down with pumpkins and all pumpkin 
		related products!&quot;</font></td>
