		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! A man in 
		Sawato named Pau Yajin asks for aid from those who have already helped 
		investigate the Tanada House of Water!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A new vendor has set shop in Arwic's tallest 
		tower. He claims that players bringing him proof a heroic deeds can buy 
		his amazing wares.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Olthoi North is no longer as safe as it once 
		was. Strange reports are coming in from adventurers.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The royal family went and discovered some 
		interesting things about the Monouga Feeding Pit. See Corporal Liao Chen 
		in Cragstone for more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Queen Elysa has asked those able to investigate 
		the dangerous new Olthoi spreading from the southern edge of the Olthoi 
		North. You are to be warned that these Olthoi are unusually deadly, so 
		be cautious.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The family that slays together, stays together, 
		right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you've been helping Ben Ten and others solve 
		the mystery of the Tanada clan, I urge you to go to Sawato. There is a 
		man there named Pau Yajin who seeks all those who helped Meshenq with 
		the Tanada House of Water.&quot;</font></p><hr width="60%">
		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tell [sic] There 
		is word from the mainland that a Sho named Pau Yajin in Sawato seeks 
		assistance from those who have already involved themselves in the 
		investigation of the Tanada House of Water.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King has reluctantly agreed to spread the 
		bloodless leaders request for help. Ahem.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, Hear ye! The bloodless harlot cowers in 
		her castle while her inept warriors test their mettle against a new 
		breed of Olthoi that have appeared to the North of their town Arwic. 
		Feel free to show them how a true warrior fights.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that the bloodless have attracted an 
		interesting shopkeep to their town of Arwic. Word is that he requires 
		proof of heroic deeds before he will sell to someone.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hehe, my child could buy something from him 
		before a bloodless warrior had proof of heroism.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tell [sic] How nice of the Bloodless to go into a 
		dangerous place and not actually fix the problem... typical of them, 
		really.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tell [sic] There is word from the mainland that a 
		Sho named Pau Yajin in Sawato seeks assistance from those who have 
		already involved themselves in the investigation of the Tanada House of 
		Water.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Varicci might want his followers to gather 
		information about these special monougas that people have discovered. 
		Worm your way into the confidence of the Bloodless - see what you can 
		find.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The bloodless pretender to the throne has sent 
		our King a warning that the Olthoi located in what they call the Olthoi 
		North have begun to spread. The King suggests that slaying this new 
		breed of Olthoi may prove a diverting task for any warrior that finds 
		themselves burdened with time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have news that a man of Sawato named Pau Yajin 
		calls for the aid of those who have already helped Meshenq and Sayuji 
		Jina investigate the Tanada House of Water. If you have already involved 
		yourself in the affairs of the Tanada, it might serve our interests if 
		you were to pursue this matter to its conclusion and speak with him.&quot;</font></p>
