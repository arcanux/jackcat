		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;An ancient arena has been found by 
		a group of fighters. You didn't hear that from me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Queen has sent an Ambassador to Silyun. I 
		wonder what the Queen is seeking from them?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Poor Prince Borelean, I hear he isn't taking his 
		mentor, Antius's death well.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It must be very hard for him. He was born on 
		Dereth, so he's never had to come to terms with death in the way those 
		from Ispar had to.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that the Raven Hand is up to 
		something again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hunters have reported finding frozen animal 
		corpses deep in the mountains. This in itself wouldn't be so strange, 
		but strange circular impressions in the snow have been found around the 
		poor creatures. Best keep an eye out while you're traveling through the 
		mountains.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I love this time of year. Everything looks so 
		white and pretty...&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ok, I'm sick of the cold now. How long until it 
		gets warm again?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Something has happened at Lunnum's Pyre. Seek out 
		Fiun Gaya for more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been rumors that the Raven Hand has 
		found an ancient Repository in the Singularity Caul. I wonder what dark 
		secrets they are trying to dredge up this time?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Ambassador in Silyun is seeking brave 
		adventurers for some mysterious task...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Queen Elysa is gathering all those who would 
		oppose Varicci. Speak to Royal Guard Qumasha in Cragstone for more 
		information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard of a group of fighters who meet in 
		secret at an ancient arena to test their combat prowess. Apparently they 
		have known about the arena for quite some time, but have been able to 
		keep it a secret simply by not talking about it. Haha, looks like the 
		ursuin is out of the sack now!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Another tragedy has befallen Fiun Gaya, who tends 
		Lunnum's Pyre in the Halaetan Isles. He is seeking assistance from those 
		who will go to help him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Well, it seems the rumor about the hatch on 
		Ulgrim's Island was true after all. In this one case, I guess he was 
		telling the truth. I still think you shouldn't listen to that man, as he 
		does still spin falsehoods and untruths wherever he ends up deciding to 
		drink for the month.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My friend ran into a Snowman who said that soon 
		the Snowmen would have the ultimate defense. I can't imagine what a 
		Snowman would think of as an ultimate defense. Maybe they built a 
		snowfort.&quot;<br>

		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors of an Ambassador from the 
		Bloodless in Silyun. How pathetic.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless Queen seems to be trying to 
		organize some sort of retaliation in Cragstone. Took her long enough.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Winter is come to Dereth once again. Not that you 
		notice it so much here on the Halaetans. This is always a cold and 
		bitter land. I'm looking forward to the day the Bloodless Queen kneels 
		to our noble monarch, so I can get a post at a more temperate location.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard reports of an Arena where those who 
		choose to do so may test their mettle against one another. Ahh, the 
		glorious days do always return, don't they.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless Queen seems to be trying to 
		organize some sort of retaliation in Cragstone. Took her long enough.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A group called the Raven Hand has found something 
		interesting.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Fiun Gaya seems to have *ahem* lost something...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The odd denizens of Frost Haven are up to 
		something...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear your Bloodless Prince isn't taking that 
		poor, brave Antius's death very well...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Fiun Gaya is seeking assistance in trying to find 
		something he, in his ineptitude, lost. Stupid Fiun. They really are good 
		for nothing more than Eater-bait.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The errant fools in Silyun seem to have attracted 
		an Ambassador from the Bloodless. Perhaps this should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Bloodless Queen is calling for all of those 
		fools who choose to side with her to travel to Cragstone, and there 
		speak with someone named Qumasha. Does the Bloodless Queen honestly 
		think she can successfully retaliate against the might of King Varicci?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard rumors of some kind of activity 
		among the denizens of Frost Haven. A community of snowmen? Can it be so? 
		Perhaps it would be wise to go and investigate these children's tales 
		come to life.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A group, known as the Raven Hand, has unearthed 
		an ancient Repository on the Singularity Caul. I wonder if there is 
		anything useful in there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;An Arena has been found, where those brave enough 
		to shrug off the protections of the meddler Asheron may engage in noble 
		conflict, testing and gaining strength through combat. Yet another place 
		where those of Noble Blood may prove their worth against the Bloodless.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;</font><br>
