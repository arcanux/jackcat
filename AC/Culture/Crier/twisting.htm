		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Her Majesty 
		seeks valorous souls to volunteer for a mission. Seek out Lieutenant 
		Allandal at Plateau Village -- that's correct, Lieutenant Allandal, not 
		Lord Marsan.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumor that there is a new Master 
		Armorer on the Halaetan Isles, who is looking for information on the 
		Shadow Armors.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear that the hatch on Ulgrim's Island remains 
		closed. I bet that silly old man just stuck a piece of wood on the 
		ground with a handle on it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard tell that there are unscrupulous 
		folk about who have some way to get rid of any evidence that people have 
		worked for King Varicci or Queen Elysa...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that a valued treasure has been 
		stolen from Sanamar, and many different factions are seeking it. I've 
		heard of three different factions so far. I wonder why this treasure is 
		so important?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;That new woman in Wai Jhou is really obsessed 
		with bandits these days. She thinks they're up to something nefarious. 
		Well, of course they are -- they're bandits!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I was chatting with Xandra Har of Wai Jhou 
		yesterday. She's convinced that some bandits in the southern Direlands 
		are developing a new super-weapon. She's looking for people to retrieve 
		it for her.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that no one has any idea what 
		happened to the force that Queen Elysa sent out to Fort Tethana. Not 
		even the people in Fort Tethana, so they've started their own 
		investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word is that mysterious folk in Sanamar and Ayan 
		Baqur have ways of erasing your past history in royal archives, so that 
		the Grand Mother of Silyun or the Grand Knight of Sanamar won't know you 
		once worked against them. If that's the case, who can be trusted?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm not the sort of person who would go into the 
		Cells of the Black Book, but I have heard that there is a new sort of 
		artifact available in there, which can render a weapon or casting device 
		unenchantable...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some people have claimed that they have seen 
		something dark moving through the jungles of Ulgrim's Island. Could be 
		smoke from the dormant volcano.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Master Armorer, from the famed Viamontian 
		Alduressa family, is seeking assistance in learning more about our 
		Shadow Armors. If you're interested in aiding this armorer, he can be 
		found near the stronghold of the Knights of Karlun. I'm not sure I'd 
		help him. What if he's just helping that maniac Varicci?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Agents in Sanamar, Silyun, and Yaraq are seeking 
		a treasure stolen from the vaults of Sanamar. Though it amuses me that 
		someone stole something from a place Varicci thought was safe, what 
		could have been stolen that has so many different groups seeking it?&quot;</font></p>

		Rumors</font></span></b><p>
		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! King Varicci 
		would have all of his loyal followers seek out Lieutenant Dialossa at 
		the Royal Hall. He has a mission of utmost importance to give.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that an Alduressa armorer has 
		emerged, and is seeking information from Bloodless smiths. These rumors 
		should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ah, you do not know how lucky you are, Bloodless 
		dog, that there are agents who can move outside the law to erase any 
		evidence of your past work for the rebels. It is not too late for you to 
		change your allegiance in this conflict...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that there is a Sho woman in Wai 
		Jhou who seeks adventurers to investigate rumors of bandits in the 
		southern Direlands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Stay away from Ulgrim's Island. The King has 
		declared it an unfit place for those who wish to remain in his favor.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is talk that the Cells of the Black Book 
		now contain a new and intriguing artifact, that helps shield your weapon 
		or casting device against the spells of enemy mages...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is someone in Sanamar who seems to be able 
		to erase evidence of past transgressions against the King. I know you 
		Bloodless dogs are fickle in your loyalties, so if you made the mistake 
		of working for the rebels or Queen Elysa in the past, you would do well 
		to visit him. Oh, and do not believe the rumors about a similar agent in 
		Ayan Baqur who offers immunity in the other direction... I know the 
		Royal Archives are inviolate.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do not listen to that old drunken fool Ulgrim. 
		There is nothing on his island but ridiculous little creatures and that 
		even more ridiculous little man.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word from the Bloodless lands is that a group of 
		bandits in the southern Direlands is developing some fearsome new 
		weapon. Seek out a woman named Xandra Har in Wai Jhou if you're 
		interested.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So it seems now that the Sclavus Hassha also has 
		some access to some kind of artifact that would prevent hostile mages 
		from casting harmful spells on your weapons... Though I believe it also 
		keeps you from casting additional spells on your weapon, as well.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The child of Count Alduressa has been reported 
		near the keep of the Knights of Karlun. He's seeking aid in contacting 
		the Master Armorers of the Bloodless. I wonder what he's up to?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;An agent of the Crown is seeking aid in the 
		return of a treasure, unlawfully stolen from the royal vaults. Seek out 
		Turien di Furza, in Sanamar, for more information. Be warned, there are 
		reports of a person in Silyun and a Bloodless in Yaraq eho also seek 
		this treasure.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Spymaster Dialossa doesn't care if you're loyal 
		to the King or not. He'll even let Bloodless who have helped the rebels 
		aid him -- he's that desperate for information.&quot;</font></td>
