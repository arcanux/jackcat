		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine at the Arcanum 
		says the Essences have returned.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;People in Xarabydun have noted that Ciandra seems 
		to have been doing a lot of research lately. I wonder what she is up 
		to?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear there is a new Royal Guard in Dryreach. Is 
		the Queen finally taking measures to protect the towns still under 
		siege?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard? Now that I can hold multiple 
		titles, I am going to go and get myself certified as a Bunny Master.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear the rats in Shoushi have been giving the 
		Rat Catcher there a difficult time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey! I found a rare item! It's called the Grand 
		Crier's Great Helm of Crying. It's so powerful, I can make announcements 
		from the comfort of my own home. I don't dare wear it in public, though. 
		Someone could kill me and take it!&quot;</font><p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier 
		tells you, &quot;Word is that someone in Ayan Baqur is looking for help on a 
		highly secret mission...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Her Majesty seeks volunteers to 
		aid with a most important mission. Please see Lord Tyrell Marsan at 
		Plateau Village for more information.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Word in Shoushi is that their Rat Catcher is 
		afraid of some smart rat who has been organizing all the rats in town.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Heralds of the realm are now able to keep 
		track of multiple titles for each person.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ciandra the Arcanum Alchemist has asked for help 
		in getting samples from the new Essences. She has a workshop on the 
		surface side of Xarabydun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that the Viamontians have a new 
		laboratory in Bluespire. Rumor has it that Lord Marsan's mission is 
		related to it somehow.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Lieutenant Rothe, of the Queen's Royal Guard, is 
		seeking brave souls to assist in the protection of Dryreach. If you go 
		to Dryreach to aid him, remember to get a key first.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ciandra has asked that all who have a Repaired 
		Shadow Stone, and wish to make a stone usable in an Isparian Weapon, 
		bring the repaired stone to her in Xarabydun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Finally -- Queen Elysa is going on the offensive. 
		She's dispatched soldiers to Plateau Village. Who know where they could 
		be going, although rumor has it they're destined for Fort Tethana.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If I were you, I would be very careful of Hassha, 
		that new Sclavus in Blackmire Swamp. I don't trust it, and I don't like 
		what I've heard of the things it offers!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are discreet, and have proved that you are 
		a stalwart ally of the people of Silyun, there may be a sensitive and 
		dangerous mission you could help out on... Seek out the ore merchant in 
		Ayan Baqur to learn more...&quot;<br>

		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;You Bloodless have no idea how bad 
		things are going to get for your Bloodless Queen very soon. Don't think 
		allying yourselves with the cringing cowards of Silyun will help.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci is verty interested in these 
		Essences of magic that have appeared recently. They could a source of 
		great power.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard tell that the citizens of Shoushi are 
		afraid of Rats!&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can't believe we haven't conquered that town 
		yet.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Let it be known that the Viamontian army has made 
		yet another bold advance onto Dereth. Where? That's a secret, I'm 
		afraid.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci is verty interested in these 
		Essences of magic that have appeared recently. They could a source of 
		great power.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears that another Sclavus has appeared, 
		bearing bloody gifts from an ancient, murderous culture. If they weren't 
		reptiles, I could come to admire these Sclavus.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I am not just a Herald, you know. I am also an 
		Adept of Vivimancy and an accredited Pugilist.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci is verty interested in these 
		Essences of magic that have appeared recently. They could a source of 
		great power.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Someone by the name of Ciandra seems to have 
		found more information on the ancient magics used to forge weapons in 
		this world. Something to do with a thing called a Shadow Stone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A member of the Bloodless Queen's Royal Guard has 
		been sighted in Dryreach. This may be worth investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've been informed that a renowned researcher and 
		alchemist, by the name of Ciandra, has found a way to fully empower 
		something referred to as a Repaired Shadow Stone. She is asking those 
		with these repaired stones to bring them to her. This should be 
		investigated first-hand, as the information may be of great interest and 
		use to His Majesty.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Royal heralds now will keep track of all the 
		titles you earn. Just another example of the great changes our noble 
		King has enacted in this benighted land.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;So I have heard that yet another Sclavus has 
		emerged from the muck of Blackmire Swamp, offering secrets of warfare. 
		Bold adventurers should investigate.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We've heard of a possible contender to the 
		Bloodless Queen's throne. Seems a Rat King has risen to power near 
		Shoushi. Maybe they're relatives.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The bold advance the army made was to the 
		northern land bridge between Northern Osteth and the Direlands. They've 
		founded a new castle -- Castle Pietrus.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a Bloodless lieutenant in the town of 
		Dryreach, asking for aid in the nearly eternal siege of that town. If 
		all the Bloodless Queen can do to protect her kingdom is beg assistance 
		from others, then this war will be a short one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A brigade of Viamontian Knights was lost 
		attempting to capture the Essence of Strife for His Majesty. We are very 
		impressed with it strength.&quot;</font></td>
