		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I am so glad that Spring has 
		finally arrived. I missed being able to feel my toes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Looks like the rabbits are at it again. I'd say 
		we'll be knee deep in bunnies in less than a week.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;People are disappearing, and no one knows why! If 
		you have any news, please seek out Guard Hrothgar, who has been tasked 
		with the investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Thank the stars that Asheron is back. Word is 
		that he's inviting people to come and visit his castle.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors that the Falatacot on Bur 
		continue their Rituals against Asheron, even though he himself has been 
		freed.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that a new baker will soon be setting 
		up a shop in Shoushi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! A new gang of Nanjou Shou-Jen of the Tanada 
		clan have been sighted in the southern land bridge!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard some trappers telling ghost stories of a 
		lost graveyard and the walking dead.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;People are disappearing, and no one knows why! If 
		you have any news, please seek out Guard Hrothgar, who has been tasked 
		with the investigation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some trappers and guides, retired soldiers by the 
		looks of it, were claiming they saw some mighty strange things somewhere 
		in the Direlands. An old graveyard, restless spirits, or some such 
		nonsense. They said they wouldn't hunt that area at night. I would 
		dismiss it, but they seemed like fairly accomplished folk.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a small Ruuk on Bur having 
		problems with these small things called Moar. I wonder if these Moar 
		have anything to do with the Moarsmen in Dereth?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Spring really seems to be making people a little 
		loopy. I've had reports of rabbit attacks. Oh, and some crazy rabbit 
		hunter claims he was killed by a rabbit of unusual size.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Haha! Suuuuure... They aren't making an April 
		Fool out of me!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Keep this between us, but Guard Hrothgar and his 
		men don't really instill me with confidence.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've got an inside source that told me that the 
		new baker specializes in pancakes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron has invited people to his castle. Now 
		that he's back, he's planning on building something there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a small Ruuk on Bur having 
		problems with these small things called Moar. I wonder if these Moar 
		have anything to do with the Moarsmen in Dereth?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Meshenq, a scholar based in Zaikhal, 
		requests the aid of those who have already investigated the Tanada 
		Houses of Air and Earth for Sayuji Jina!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Falatacot continue their Rituals against 
		Asheron on Bur, but I also hear that the three Matriarchs have left the 
		ritual in the hands of powerful acolytes. I wonder what they are up to 
		now?&quot;</font><br>

		good, this warm weather means I can begin planting my garden of monster 
		plants. I'm hoping to win the coveted 'Most Dangerous Garden' award this 
		year.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Even we Viamontians welcome the news of a new 
		baking enterprise, even if it is being set up in Shoushi. Life's not all 
		about conquering and subjugating the inferior, you know.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Ah good, this warm weather means I can begin

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard reports that the Falatacot on Bur 
		continue their Rituals against the being called Asheron, even though he 
		himself has been freed.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you wouldn't mind could you take a little time 
		and hunt the vermin that are breeding so rapidly around here? The royal 
		farms have been hit particularly hard by the rabbits. There will be 
		repercussions if the King cannot have his vegetables.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there is one of the scrawny Burun 
		on Bur having problems with these small things called 'Moar.' These 
		'Moar' should be investigated.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard some trappers telling ghost stories of a 
		lost graveyard and the walking dead.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that the 'great' kingdom of New Aluvia 
		has been losing its citizens to kidnapping again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have word that the Empyrean mage has returned. 
		I suppose that it's better to have him here on Dereth than in the 
		clutches of those Blood Witches.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that another band of those Sho 
		assassins, the Tanada clan, have appeared in the southern land bridge.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron has invited everyone to come and visit 
		his home on the island off the east coast of Dereth. Go, enjoy his 
		hospitality and remember, any of his secrets that you can learn would be 
		greatly appreciated by the King.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Pancakes are inferior to Viamontian toast... but 
		they can still be done with great style. I actually sincerely wish the 
		new Shoushi baker well in his enterprise.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that there is one of the scrawny Burun 
		on Bur, by the name of Tibik, having problems with these small things 
		called 'Moar.' These 'Moar' should be investigated. You never know when 
		a new creature could prove to be useful.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My sources in the Viamontian military have told 
		me that the competence of the current Bloodless army is very low right 
		now - apparently they've not really recovered since the majority was 
		slain in the Shadow March.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some trappers and guides, retired soldiers by the 
		looks of it, were claiming they say some mighty strange things somewhere 
		in the Direlands. An old graveyard, restless spirits, or some such 
		nonsense. They said they wouldn't hunt that area at night. I would 
		dismiss it, but they seemed fairly accomplished folk.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier smiles malevolently.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Falatacot continue their Rituals against 
		Asheron on Bur, but I also have reports that the three Matriarchs have 
		left the ritual in the hands of powerful acolytes. One can only assume 
		they have other plans in the works. Perhaps these Falatacot will seek to 
		make war on us for interfering, or choose to test their mettle against 
		the superior hordes of Viamont?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are hear to tell me about some giant 
		rabbit that only you can see then just turn around and go back to your 
		padded room my friend. I am not so foolish as to believe in...&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Great gory horns of the Red Bull of Sanamar! 
		What's that behind you?&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Haha, you are the fool this time, friend!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that a Bloodless scholar named 
		Meshenq in Zaikhal seeks the aid of those who have already investigated 
		the Tanada Houses of Air and Earth on behalf of Sayuji Jina. Ah, the 
		Bloodless seem to have a recurring assassin problem, don't they?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;</font></span></td>
