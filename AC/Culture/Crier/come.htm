		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Mi Krau-Li 
		has devised another method to upgrade his jitte!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of adventurers coming back from 
		the Halateans, talking about finding new encampments of Ruschk and 
		Viamontian fortifications in the farthest reaches of the Isles.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard about these new uninscription 
		stones? No more words of wisdom passed down from father to son, mother 
		to daughter. Now you can just scratch that stuff out and put naughty 
		limericks on your items.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It would seem that hunting is back in season.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of small, tamed creatures 
		following adventurers around Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've seen more people running around with those 
		bone and gristle bows recently. I have a friend who uses one of those 
		ghastly contraptions. It's unsanitary if you ask me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A very wise swordsman named Liao Ozaka has taken 
		residence in Mayoi.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that there is a way to further 
		upgrade the Silifi of Crimson Stars past the first three gems...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Thank goodness we were able to split Grael and 
		defeat him. And it seems that our Dardante problems may be over as long 
		as he stays with his new master.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Adventurers who bear the Improved Jitte of 
		Mi Krau-Li should seek him out again! It seems he has finally improved 
		upon his second design!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard several adventurers talking about 
		finding new Viamontian encampments and organized Ruschk encampments in 
		the valley on the Isle of Ruin. I wonder what they are up to now?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Uninscription stones are available from the 
		translators in Cragstone, Hebian To, and Zaikhal! The stone only works 
		on general treasure though; unique items don't seem to be affected. It's 
		too bad, I wanted to remove that inscription that Oswald left on my 
		Gertarh's Dagger...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousins in Stonehold, Shoushi, Holtburg, and 
		Lin tell me that some interesting folk have moved in recently. What, you 
		don't believe me? We town criers have a lot of cousins.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! A mysterious adventurer named Maqudh al 
		Nishadina has appeared near Zaikhal, claiming to be able to add a fourth 
		stone to the Silifi of Crimson Stars!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin was telling me about a shop near the 
		Obsidian Span that is purportedly selling pets! I want a pet... Hmmm...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We should all be glad for the defeat of Grael and 
		the truce between King Varicci and Queen Elysa. I wonder how long it 
		will last? It seems clear to me, at least, that we could not have 
		unlocked the secrets of Grael and defeated his three aspects without 
		that cooperation. But what do I know? I'm just a town crier.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have an archer friend who asked Master Hanzu in 
		Ayan Baqur to upgrade his bow a few months ago. It seems the Bowyer 
		Master took his request seriously and has figured out a way to upgrade 
		the Composite Bows and Crossbows.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Need a vassal? I won't ask for much just some 
		tinkered armor and maybe a tinkered weapon. Oh and maybe a few MMD trade 
		notes, or maybe some golem hearts, wasp wings, armoredillo spines, 
		lugian sinews, dark revenant thigh bones, full sturdy iron key rings, 
		full singularity key rings, or anything else that you don't need.&quot;</font></td>
