		has appeared outside of Asheron's Tower. Any information should be 
		brought to Asheron himself!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just when I think that the field of alchemy must 
		surely be exhausted, and we know all that we were meant to, the 
		alchemists go and surprise me with yet another development...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron has requested an audience at his tower 
		with our greatest heroes. Perhaps you could tell any you know about it.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;That's a small joke. No charge.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Virindi device has appeared outside of 
		Asheron's Tower. Any information should be brought to Asheron himself!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The sentient snowmen are back and harrying the 
		land again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Town criers are available in most major towns to 
		tell you of the latest news and events. We'll also give you a piece of 
		information for a bit of money.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Just when I think that the field of alchemy must 
		surely be exhausted, and we know all that we were meant to, the 
		alchemists go and surprise me with yet another development...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A warning to travelers - some new creatures have 
		been spied in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you recall how tragic it was when Asheron fell 
		in battle against the Hopeslayer - no, that's not what happened at all. 
		I wonder what cause that thought to spring to my head?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Fort Tethana has become quite a haven for all 
		sorts of characters, hasn't it?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If only there were aught we could do to help free 
		those who live in thrall to the Olthoi...wait...we...we did slay the 
		Queen, right? Why does it feel like she's still alive?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you have an attuned item you no longer need, 
		feel free to donate it to a Town Crier.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you remember the portal which brought you 
		here? Sometimes I wake up and feel like I am back in Ispar, but then I 
		realize that somehow that is wrong, and we would have doomed many, many 
		worlds had we never come to Auberean. Imagine what evil may have 
		befallen the worlds had we never come here?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron has asked for our help. Speak to the 
		Elemental in his tower off the coast of Eastham.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Janier al-Evv has devised a method by which the 
		crafting of phials may be done in batches. Hurray for alchemy!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hey, money! I appreciate it. Your contributions 
		are welcome.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A proliferation of 'Dire Champions' have been 
		causing trouble in the Direlands. The Queen has enlisted the help of a 
		Tumerok huntsman in Ayan Baqur to deal with the threat. He has hunting 
		experience you may find useful in honing your skills.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's an Aun Tumerok in Fort Tethana who is 
		seeking help, but he won't accept help from just anyone. He will accept 
		nothing less than assisting Asheron as proof that you may be trusted.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's said that Thorsten Cragstone is going to be 
		outfitting another raid against the Black Death Catacomb to see who he 
		can rescue. Wait, Thorsten is dead - this is all making no sense.&quot;<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh just like everyone else, my advice is only 
		good enough for a paltry amount of pyreals! Well thank you, Mr. 
		Pyrealbags this'll go a long way toward providing for my family. I'm 
		sure that an egg will feed me, my three kids and my spouse.&quot;<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh you just don't know...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;...Please don't kill me, sirrah...since we lost 
		the protection of the Light, I've been tortured in so many ways...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The blind snowman has returned and still seeks 
		his eyes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I used to think that being a town crier was my 
		calling, but these days I'm not so sure.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;It's thirsty work, setting up shop back in

		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;The Olthoi who plague this land shall never overtake the might of 
		Viamont. Though you Bloodless find yourselves with no leader save this 
		Thorsten Cragstone, and he little more than a brigand, Varicci shall in 
		his wisdom and benevolence take pity upon you and will protect you, 
		should you submit to him. Else, you will be cast out to fend for 
		yourself. Choose wisely.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are Tumeroks living in a city of stone to truly 
		be trusted? It seems peculiar, to me at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Empyrean has asked for help. If you wish to 
		play the puppet to his puppeteer you should go to his Tower.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Travelers in the desert have seen odd visions of 
		Olthoi. Beware.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I found a funny orange coin while practicing my 
		fighting skills in the Direlands. It's probably nothing.&quot;<br>

		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I found a funny orange coin while practicing my 
		fighting skills in the Direlands. It's probably nothing.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Loyalists are encouraged to go to the Bloodless 
		lands and obtain the latest secret of alchemy they have discovered. You 
		are a loyalist, right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Empyrean has asked for help. If you wish to 
		play the puppet to his puppeteer you should go to his Tower.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Welcome to Corcosa - we are glad that you have 
		come to visit. Um...wait, we aren't on Ispar, are we...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;To all those who live in these lands, be it known 
		that King Varicci grants asylum and protection for those who would 
		resist the depradations of the Hopeslayer, in return for an oath of 
		fealty. Let Bael'zharon swallow the rest.&quot;</font></span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">You give Town Crier 
		Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I remember when Varicci laid siege to Duke 
		Bellenesse's keep. Trapped like rats, and slain in very much the same 
		way. Thus should it always be to traitors - no escape and no hope.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Janier al-Evv - this man you must seek. He holds 
		secrets of alchemy that Viamont would have, and rumor has it that he has 
		found an improvement to his latest success.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you truly want to know what I think you should 
		give the Blind Snowman? I believe you should give him the end of a fire 
		sword.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Aun Tumeroks have sent one of their Huntsmen 
		to help quell the rise of a dangerous group of 'Dire Champion' creatures 
		in the Dires. He has much experience in hunting dangerous creatures and 
		shares it to those who assist him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;...they're all dead...the king, the count, the 
		Rossu Morta...the Hopeslayer killed them all. We thought we could 
		withstand them...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;King Varicci offers a bounty of 100000 pyreal for 
		the head of Thorsten Cragstone!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;...I've felt very depressed, lately...as if life 
		has no meaning.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Aun Tumeroks have been meddling in the 
		visions of others of late. Perhaps they are responsible for the bad 
		dreams of those within the realm. Kill them all, I say.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron feels that our warriors may be of use in 
		the fight against the rising threat of Aerbax. Visit him in his tower 
		near Eastham.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Surely you can spare more than that. Do I look 
		like a common beggar to you?&quot;</font></span></p></td>
