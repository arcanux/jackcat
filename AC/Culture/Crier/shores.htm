		<font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen those new suits of 
		Relic Armor? If I weren't depending on my job as a Town Crier for my 
		retirement plan, I would be out adventuring to get one of those for 
		myself!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell there is some strange and terrible 
		creature, never before seen by Isparian eyes, on that Dark Isle...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear the Emissary of Asheron in Eastham is 
		distraught about something.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a rumor that Grael has done something 
		terrible to Asheron! Or, at least has done something to Asheron's 
		Island! Oh no, this isn't good...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of a Shadow in the north, 
		setting people on the path to access the Dark Isle that has risen from 
		the sea.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen those foul new beasts that infest 
		the shores of the Dark Isle? Truly disgusting!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;New arrivals to Dereth can obtain a nice suit of 
		armor from the Pathwardens, who are stationed in Holtburg, Yaraq, 
		Shoushi, and Sanamar. They'll also accept the suits of armor back when 
		you've outgrown them, and will give you useful items in exchange.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;After the shattering of that mysterious crystal, 
		the Dark Isle raised itself from the bottom of the sea. I hear it can be 
		seen from Vissidal Isle and from Aerlinthe.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a Shadow, sent by Isin Dule, near the 
		portal to the Temple of N'cthail, north of Bandit Castle. I guess Isin 
		Dule is keeping his word about the Isle. He's so unusual, for a 
		Shadow...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Queen Elysa has verified what we all suspected: a 
		recent rise in Shadow activity. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing 
		shadowy pools appearing outside of towns. She has requested that you 
		report any odd activity or shadow sightings to the Shadow Hunters in Wai 
		Jhou. She assures everyone that the Arcanum and the Royal Guard are 
		taking this new possible threat seriously and are investigating the 
		matter.<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have to say, while the Falatacot and Viamontian 
		suits of Relic armor are very imposing, the Noble Relic Armor is very 
		aptly named.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears a new benevolent order, named the 
		Pathfinders, has dedicated itself to providing for new arrivals to 
		Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've been receiving a lot of reports of Shadows 
		around towns. Keep your eyes out for them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! An island has risen from the depths of the 
		sea near Vissidal Island!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Dark storm clouds have been seen sweeping across 
		the Direlands of late. You better wear your waterproof clothing when you 
		go adventuring.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen those new suits of Reli<span lang="en-us">c</span> Armor? If 
		I weren't depending on my job as a Town Crier for my retirement plan, I 
		would be out adventuring to get one of those for myself!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The weather is beginning to unnerve me. Do you 
		think the solar eclipse is a bad omen? It sure looks like one.&quot;</font>&nbsp;<hr width="65%">

		<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Be 
		wary of freak storm clouds while traveling through the Bloodless lands. 
		Reports of Shadows congregating around these strange weather patterns 
		have all but been silenced by reason.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Through the noble efforts of Viamontian 
		Champions, and the occasional presence of Bloodless dogs, the Dark Isle 
		has been dredged up from the depths of the sea!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a new organization called the 
		Pathwardens who have made it their task to outfit new arrivals in Dereth. 
		They claim neutrality, but I have my doubts.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that there are strange new creatures to 
		be found on this Dark Isle that rose from the depths in the sea far to 
		the east...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports from the Bloodless lands that 
		one of their &quot;Shadows&quot; is granting those who are powerful enough access 
		to the Isle where Grael once slept.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A warning to you. Unless you are looking to 
		fight, be careful when visiting Sanamar. Some Shadows have been seen 
		spying there from the bluffs west of town. The King is waiting to see 
		what actions if any they are planning.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Another Bloodless dog. Maybe you know something 
		about what has happened to Count Dardante, hm? All your kind are under 
		suspicion.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a new organization called the 
		Pathwardens who have made it their task to outfit new arrivals in Dereth. 
		They claim neutrality, but I have my doubts.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear that Grael did something terrible to 
		Asheron in his own house. I don't respect that bumbling Isparian wizard, 
		but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with him gone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen the beautiful suits of Relic Armor 
		that His Majesty's agents have been distributing to worthy warriors?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The typical Hysterics of the Bloodless are in 
		full swing as they declare some apocalyptic war coming. I'm sure that 
		they overstate matters and whatever has caused these recent 
		meteorological aberrations will be explained in due course.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There is a Shadow, sent by that strange voice 
		heard last month, north of &quot;Bandit Castle&quot;. This creature is sending 
		those powerful enough to gain entry to the Dark Isle of the Mukkir, 
		Grael.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;One of my informants tells me that some crazy 
		elemental is crying nonsense in the Bloodless town of Eastham. They 
		really should keep those things out of town.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;You're one of those Bloodless dogs. Maybe even a 
		member of that treacherous Raven Hand. What have you done with Count 
		Dardante? What did you do to him?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those who set to shattering the Soul Crystal that 
		held the Dark Isle beneath the waves last month are now capable of 
		seeing the fruits of their labors. The Dark Isle has risen between 
		Vissidal Isle and Aerlinthe Isle. Perhaps there is even more there that 
		can be recovered than there was on Vissidal Isle...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;A dark vortex has been reported near the dark 
		remains on the Isle of Ruin. Our Knights have reported disturbing 
		whispers and shadows that dance out of range before they can be properly 
		seen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have reports of a strange new creature to be 
		found on that perilous Dark Isle. It appears to be another mollusk like 
		the Niffis, but twisted with dark magic.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are new to Dereth, you may wish to speak 
		with this Pathwarden who has appeared in Sanamar. It appears that this 
		organization wishes to equip all newcomers with suits of armor.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;The King has offered a mighty reward to those who 
		can battle the creatures of the Dark Isle and claim their trophies: a 
		full suit of powerfully enchanted Relic Armor.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;This pyreal appears to be stamped with the 
		Bloodless Queen's royal mark. Well, the pyreal it's made of is 
		appreciated at least.&quot;</font></span><p>

		the Raven Hand may have bought themselves a good deal more trouble from 
		our King than they were expecting.&quot; </font></span></td>
