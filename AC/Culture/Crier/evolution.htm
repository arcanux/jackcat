		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Something in the Direlands has caused increase 
		Monouga activity. They're all over the place now.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There seems to be some kind of unrest among the 
		Tuskers ruled by Oolutanga. It may be worth investigating.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Alchemists of Dereth have developed

		<p><font size="2" face="arial">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Strange new

		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard rumors of strange new Olthoi roaming 
		around the Northeast of Dereth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you heard of these new phials developed by 
		Dereth's master alchemists? You can throw them like missile weapons and 
		they cast spells like Imperil upon impact.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! A group of powerful creatures stand as 
		champions in the Colosseum, offering great rewards to any who can best 
		them! They will only accept challenges from those who have proven 
		themselves against the original gauntlet of the Colosseum. The further 
		you advance, the more powerful creature you can challenge...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've a cousin who is a tracker, and he says that 
		Drudges have been seen increasingly heading toward the northern 
		Direlands.&quot;<br>

		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors

		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">VIAMONTIAN</font></span></b></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;I've received reports of a new variety of the strange insect-like 
		creatures called Olthoi. These creatures seem to be appearing in the 
		northeast region of Dereth.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have heard reports of unrest among the talking 
		apes of Oolutanga's Refuge, on that large island off the eastern coast 
		of the Bloodless lands.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;We have received word that there are new 
		champions to fight in the Colosseum. A loyal and proud Viamontian would 
		step forth to challenge and depose them.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I wonder what the Drudges are going to do with 
		all the food they've liberated... ahem... stolen from Cragstone?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are reports that master alchemists have 
		developed new thrown weapons. This should be investigated. It sounds 
		very useful.&quot; </font></span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
		&quot;If you wish to challenge the new Colosseum champions for the honor and 
		glory of Viamont, you must first prove yourself in the Colosseum's 
		traditional gauntlet. The farther you advance, the more powerful the 
		champion to face you.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have several reports of strange, somehow 
		altered Olthoi creatures in the northeast region of Dereth. These 
		creatures must be originating from somewhere within this 'Olthoi 
		North.'&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems that alchemists of Dereth have created 
		an innovation in the arts of war - phials that you can throw at your 
		enemies to devastate them with harmful spells. Brilliant!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;His Majesty King Varicci has let it be known that 
		he encourages his subjects to journey east to Oolutanga's Refuge and see 
		what is agitating those Tuskers. Their king seems to have a new 
		favorite, and it has created a great deal of political tension.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;As far as I'm aware, Viamont is not the cause of 
		all the new Monouga activity. There's something more sinister going on.&quot;
