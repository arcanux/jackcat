    <td valign="top" width="222"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, "Deep in the forests on the plateau, I have received word of glints of steel, surrounded by a purplish glow.  I shudder to think at what new weapons of destruction are used up there.  *Shivers*"<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "The Tumeroks here are split into two warring tribes. The ones up on the plateau are funny sorts. Actually, they're rather nice. Bit preachy. The ones down here though, the ones that look like the ones on Dereth... *shudder*"<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "News! Burn and electrocution victims have been limping back into town for weeks. We have not yet determined what out in the wilderness could cause this much agony."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "I don't know why the Tumeroks up on the plateau look different. We've noticed that the ones in Ahruenga - that's their town on the west coast - are a bit bent. And that chief of theirs is... worrying. Don't tell them I said any of this. There are stories..."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "We've heard reports of a new Mattekar roaming the northern parts of the island.  I've heard some unscruplous folks are already trying to find ways of processing the hide.  The poor, poor mattie."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "We sent a few scouts up on the plateau recently. They reported a bunch of the old menhir rings standing up there. The funny Tumeroks even built their town around one. They seem awfully interested in them, if you ask me."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "We've heard from the Tumies that there are some massive Empyrean ruins up on the plateau. None of us have seen them yet, though. I think they called them "walls to stay the water.""<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "News! Travelers beware: Tumerok factions are battling for possession of the island! Do not get caught in the crossfire! Adventure in groups! Ration your supplies! Watch your pyreals!"<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "I hear this island used to be called Marae Lassel.  It sounds Viamontian to me.  A snooty lot, eh?"<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "The great years are gone, if you ask me. Where can you find the like of Wari al-Sha'im these days, or Lord Cragstone, or Saint Elysa? Ah, I tell you, if the Olthoi could produce another queen, many would die before she could be defeated."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "Behdo Yii in Redspire is looking for assistance to help clear out an abandoned Tumerok Outpost.  Please help him!"<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "We've had a lot of problems with brigands lately. Not just us, for that matter. The Tumies are bedeviled by them too. Queen Elysa's Advocates think they're coming from Vesayen. Doesn't it just figure? MacNiall and McNeill cause trouble wherever they go."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "We don't go up on the plateau much. It's riddled with Olthoi hives, and the land is...queer. Everything is overgrown with patches of fungus, like you find in Olthoi tunnels.  It's almost as if it's been changed to suit them. The bugs up there do seem smarter, but not enough to do something that big. Our sage likes to call it an "infection.""<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "There is something that I don't trust about that Britana.  Beautiful, you say?  Like a black widow spider, perhaps."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "I wonder how Flufens is faring? It has been many weeks since she started her farm out by the western shore."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "Watch out for the Tumerok they call Tuperea. He's a hunter, we think. He has a pack of trained reedsharks that he uses to flush the siraluun from cover. But to that one, everything is prey - including you."<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, "Have you just arrived? Have you SEEN the Tumies up on the plateau? Sweet mothers, I didn't even recognize them! They have... have TAILS! And their magic is different from ours!"</font></td>
