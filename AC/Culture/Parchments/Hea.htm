    <td valign="top" width="225"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hea Town Crier tells you, "News! More Hea are leaving the island than ever before!  All Hea who wish to rejoin with our brethren in Osteth must first fullfill their obligations to the atual arutoa."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The poacher Aun Ralirea vexes our tah. He hunts the things you call gromnies, up among their lairs on the plateau. Hea Arantah has set aside a great reward for the one who brings him proof of Ralirea's demise. I suppose he would even grant it to a soft one like you, if you managed it. But don't try to decieve our glorious tah by claiming the deed of another! He can read your keh like the speeding clouds and the leaping fish."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "News! A search party has been sent for Hea Toneawa. We believe he is consorting with the enemy."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The wretched Aun quiver in fear of Wharu's might. His hoardes can eat the heart from the mightiest lodge's supports, and sweep the land of all but the bare stone and clean white bones. Aun drummers alone hold his divine shadow from swallowing the sun. But he shall be freed - so the atual arutoa have roared in the kehs of our xuta."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The rings the Aun shamen use are old and weak, like their arrogant tah. Every time the shamen beat their drums, the stones tremble. All that would be required to break them is a greater noise than that of Aun drums. Our glorious tah, Hea Arantah, would be much pleased if this were done."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Many years ago, when Hea and Aun lived together in Timaru, the atual arutoa greeted our glorious tah. The Aun were cruel and cold to him, though they will tell you otherwise. An orphan, they cared for him not. Starving, they feed him not. To Hea Arantah alone, chosen of the atual arutoa, were offered powers of great wrath, with which he lead the outcast and scorned children of Timaru into the wild. Forty passages of the moons later, he lead them back to take the Hea xuta for their own. Hea Huantah had his feet set upon the road, forevermore to be known as Tonk Huanpuh. Now the proud are cast down, and gnash their teeth at their own selfishness and cruelty. Hea Arantah is blessed among us. Blessed..."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Hea Tuperea hunts for our tah along the base of the plateau. If you meet in your travels, stay upwind of him. His hunters are fierce, and have been been given their share in the blessings of the atual arutoa. Mighty and strange are the atual arutoa, who care even to bless the beasts of the field."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "There are rumors of Carenzi infestations on the island, but we're not worried."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The atual arutoa watch over us, and our lands. You will not see them, but they are here, learning of Wharu."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Wharu's children are diligent. Their mother will return. They will see to it. As will the friends of the atual arutoa."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "All Hea should report to Rangaua for briefing on the Palenqual affair. From this time forward the Hea shall have no traffic with the Aun."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The Aun have placed a bounty on the atual arutoa, who helped us gain our freedom. Now the enemy of the Virindi are also our enemy!"<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The Aun xuta shall not long sully the lands which belong to the Hea xuta. Our glorious tah has set keen-eyed Hea Temenua and his brothers to watch the plateau. They will drive all from our rightful and well-earned holdings! Long ago, it was Temenua who captured the first of your kind that we met. She was given unto the atual arutoa, who said to us then, "Here are the ones we have gifted you in the image of. Behold! We will open Wind and Light to you, that you may go among their holdings. Bring them to us. We wish to understand them, and the one they are protected by."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "The atual arutoa watch over us, and our lands. You will not see them, but they are here, learning of Wharu."<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Hea Riketura has announced a bounty on the heads of our Aun brethren. Those who bring him an Aun birth pendant shall be rewarded handsomely!"<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Heed my warning, pale one. Our glorious tah, Hea Arantah, has gained many powers from his dealings with the atual arutoa. But he is... passionate. Do not meddle in his affairs if you value your life."<br>
      <br>
      You give Hea Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
      <br>
      Hea Town Crier tells you, "Bah, we are not mercenaries.  Anything we wish to say, we say, coins or no coins.  But I'll keep the money.  It is the cost of your insult."</font></td>
