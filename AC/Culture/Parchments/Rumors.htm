      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;I've seen people fighting in the streets. What madness is this? Has 
      Asheron grown so weak that his protection does not suffice any longer? 
      I'll wager that you couldn't beat me if I sloughed off his protection for 
      a bit of sport. Well, if I wasn't on duty that is.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Olthoi came all at once. People scurried for 
      the safety of buildings. It was horrible, so many memories swelling to the 
      surface again.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Linvak Lugians have warned us that two new 
      Gotrok citadels have been established in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;That gentleman in the tavern said your mother wears 
      steel-toed gromnie hide boots. I believe you should challenge him!&quot;<br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;No, I did not wager on the outcome, what do you 
      take me for? Well, maybe a very small wager...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Four more Olthoi hives have appeared in the north!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yeah? Go pink and say that!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Deals made in shadow, brought into dim light and 
      blessed in the blood of the innocent make for a new form of battle on this 
      world. I'm not one to raise a blade against my brethren, but if I was... I 
      wonder, how weak has Asheron grown since being sequestered on his island?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I believe I could have been a contender!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell that the High Queen is coming to rid 
      the Olthoi from the surface herself. Of course, I had also heard that she 
      was on the move last month. I'm not so sure I trust my sources anymore.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you are visiting Fort Tethana or Candeth Keep 
      keep an eye out for Gotrok encampments. We have received word that they 
      have been busy working on new Citadels in those areas.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumor says there is a new Olthoi hive near Beach 
      Pass and one near the New Cannthalo settlement.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;That fellow Antius was poking around all over 
      Dereth. Perhaps he was looking for a source of this latest Olthoi 
      incursion. I just hope they rid them from this place. I don't want to go 
      back to living in a cave stirring a pot.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Why is everyone fighting? Can't we all get along?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;What are we to do, the land is not safe. The Olthoi 
      have come back and they mean to enslave us all.&quot;</font></span></p>

      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;Has it been over a year since the destruction of Yanshi? I can't help but 
      think of that poor jeweler who never returned to the Lifestone with the 
      rest of the town's folk...&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors of new Olthoi hives in the North! 
      I do hope all the homeowners there have a Horn of Vigilance... Available, 
      by the way, at all sellers named Coron Usgin in Zaikhal. Guaranteed to 
      keep Olthoi away! At least, uh, I think they are. Well, I believe you can 
      return it to Coron Usgin if not satisfied, a one hundred percent pyreal-back 
      guarantee! I think...&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;Iquba's 
      tavern in Qalabar's been awfully crowded these days, but no one seems to 
      be buying any ale, just examining some strange keys.&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, 
      &quot;I've heard tell that all but one of the potions we once used for casting 
      spells is used in crafting new protective stones.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Our refusal to speak last month was for our own 
      reasons. We're underpaid and it's as though our voices are no longer 
      heard. Many of us decided that we'd be silent for a cycle of the moons in 
      protest. Did it work?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Tumeroks have grown a huge tree in the center 
      of Candeth Keep. They say that it's the heart of the city. Supposedly they 
      can talk to it or some such nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I respect their 
      beliefs, I'm just not sure I believe them.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;They have infested most of the world, and now the 
      Olthoi have begun to blight our lands. And to make matters worse, it looks 
      as though they are beginning to establish new hives in the Olthoi North!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Aerbax and Nuhmudira seem to be at each other's 
      throats. I wonder what this will mean for the refugees of Yanshi.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some adventurers came back from the stronghold 
      northwest of Mount Esper the other day -- they reported that it'd gotten 
      much more difficult. Something about new monsters moving in! They were 
      going to check two other dungeons, but I don't remember which ones.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Rumors persist that the Harbinger is reforming much 
      more quickly. If it's true what more could we possibly face. We have the 
      Renegade Tumeroks, the Gotrok Lugians, Aerbax, Olthoi and now a thing that 
      is an elemental force. It's good to see that Nuhmudira is doing something 
      about it over there. Of course... it would be better if she didn't have a 
      Sclavus speaking for her.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;In the Halls of Lost Light the Guardian has stirred 
      and the sword glows brighter now than ever. Perhaps this is an omen of 
      things to come. Perhaps it is a sign that even in this growing darkness 
      there is still hope.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can't wait until I have done enough for Candeth 
      Keep to be recognized as a founder. I hear the shops there are exquisite!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I never thought I'd see the day where Alchemists 
      would be smiling again.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm trusting in the good faith of the populace to 
      keep me well protected. I figure now that you can craft your own 
      protections I might just be safe on my walkabouts.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;...and a warrior came forth bearing the mark of 
      Light upon him. He carried, in his hand, the rays of the sun crafted into 
      steel. A blade with a purpose in the hands of a virtuous heart brings hope 
      where there is none. The Light has been found again.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;It seems as though the Gotrok Lugians and their 
      Renegade Tumerok comrades are continuing to siege Fort Tethana.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear word that the keep in the South Dires is 
      almost completed. Merchants from all three races of the alliance have 
      moved in to provide adventurers with supplies and places of rest.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard from Alatar Locke recently... he was upset 
      that he had to redo some of his oldest notes... something about some 
      carved caves?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yanshi has suddenly become popular again. I've 
      heard that a Virindi and a Sclavus have taken up in the ruins, professing 
      their allegiance to new leaders. I can only see ill coming from this.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard tell that High Queen Elysa is forming an 
      expedition to enter the tunnels deep beneath Asheron's Island. I wonder if 
      there is any truth to it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I was worried when the Olthoi first began to 
      congregate in the north, but now they have twisted the land into their 
      own! This can only mean bad things for us.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Yeah, we're all talking again. But the truth of the 
      matter is that we're still unhappy. Tumeroks and Lugians standing by our 
      side! Ha! Tell them to leave us alone in the wilderness, then we'll talk 
      peace.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Swear to me or die! Ha, ha, just joking. Who would 
      be that cruel?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've heard that one of Asheron's emissaries has 
      been spotted in Yanshi. Perhaps he is there keeping the peace.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I voted for Locke Ridge...&quot;</font></span></p>

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I was looking through my satchels a few days ago 
      and found my Isparian Wand had burned a whole through the burlap and 
      fallen on the ground! It's never done that before!&quot;^<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I've felt the ground shuddering at night, haven't 
      you? Something is happening, I know it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears as though Hibdin Velos has taken the 
      position once held by Martine.I've heard tell that he moved into the 
      throne room and everything.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I spent all month gathering minerals for Kreavon in 
      Wei jhou. I stopped by the outpost this morning before coming here and he 
      rewarded me with an odd hat.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Martine's Retreat could have been such a nice place 
      to live, and now look at it. They have barely enough food to survive.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;My brother has a friend who knows this guy who 
      knows the architect that's working on Candeth Keep. He says the poor guy 
      is really frustrated. Seems that there are too many people trying to make 
      decisions about the town.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Someone scouting the Renegade encampment at Teth 
      said it sounded like a raid by them could happen any time. You should go 
      see. Then come back and let me know. I can charge people for the 
      information! Ha ha.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard that Ulgrim offended the volcano spirits 
      somehow and the volcano near his house began spitting out small golems 
      everywhere.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Did you hear? Ulgrim's Island is a spawning ground 
      for Golems. They go there to mate. Huh, wonder how that works.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Do you think that there is trouble ahead? We 
      haven't heard from Asheron recently, Nuhmudira is up to her old 
      ways...what you don't think it was her that killed Jaleh? I think she did, 
      correct me if I am wrong but didn't she threaten him once. Not to mention 
      the crunching noises in the night.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear that Ulgrim angered Asheron and in 
      retaliation Asheron summoned a hundred golems to attack him.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I heard that Ulgrim was creating a small golem army 
      to do his bidding, but they rebelled and escaped to a nearby island.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Be careful if you go to Candeth Keep. My cousin got 
      hit on the head with a wooden beam that a Lugian was moving. My cousin's 
      kind of a clumsy guy.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear Ulgrim built his house next to an active 
      Volcano. I'm suprised he didn't build his house on top of it!&quot; <br>

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Oh, you heard about some advancements in Tinkering 
      too?&quot; <br>

      recently just before returning to his island.&quot;<br>

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;The shopkeepers here keep complaining about the 
      lost revenues from trade notes, but I don't see them going hungry. Elysa 
      was right to make them cooperate -- we're all human, after all, and we 
      have to work together to build Dereth!&quot;<br>

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;You know the sword on that ice dias in Glenden 
      Wood? It is there for the taking! But first you must prove yourself 
      worthy.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;A friend of mine got the Sword of Frozen Fury from

      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Why yes, now I remember. There are also some

      if I were a smart mage going to talk with Olcris I'd be bringing my

      worthy. No, we were not worthy.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Town Crier tells you, &quot;Secret Orders? I don't have any and I don't know of 
      any, if I did they wouldn't be so secret now would they? But since you did 
      provide me with some coin I'll tell you something.&quot;<br>

    Islands. It is south of Mayoi, my sister was running on the beach there, 
    accidentally went through it and was eaten. Luckily, she had recently 
    registered at one of Nuhmudira's new Lifestones, but it was back on Marae 
    Lassel. She had a long trip back.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;With the new creatures that have taken over the 
    Direlands, the Tumeroks out there have been fortifying their holdings. Be 
    careful if you go to visit them, though - these are NOT the friendly kind of 
    Tumerok. Rumor mongers in Dryreach, Stonehold, and Fort Tethana have more 
    information.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The migration of creatures seems to have settled down 
    a bit. I went hunting the other day and found that one monster I never could

    all too easy to hunt, killed me. Dead. I wanted to laugh but it hurt too 
    much with my lungs ripped out.&quot;<br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;It appears the research that Nuhmudira has been 
    conducting into the lore of Lifestones has resulted in the placement of a 
    number of new Lifestones. Give me some money and I may tell where they are.&quot;<br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;There's a strange old lady who lives in a cave near 
    Cragstone. When I was younger, we'd go down there and play jokes on her all 
    the time. She hated us.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I overheard someone 
    say that they were able to get their Tumerok Banner framed at one of the 
    Master Furniture Makers. He did warn, however, that once you get a framed 
    version you cannot trade it in for the reward. There was something else... 
    oh yes, he said the Master Furniture Maker crafted a mounted version of the

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Tusker Temples... who would have ever thought they 
    would start worshipping things and have worshippers themselves. Careful in 
    there. I hear that if you pray to the statue something happens.&quot;<br>

    They're fast, strong, and violent. I think that they earned their name.&quot;<br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Stay away from the really big Tusker. I hear that 
    they are incredibly strong and brutal.&quot;<br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Those construction Golems in Arwic sure are slow and 
    lazy! Of course, I wouldn't say that to their, uh, faces. Actually, forget I

    Does he have something to do with that new...place?&quot;<br>

    through the Direlands. The tuskers have some new stone idols that they carry 
    with them. They even worship them in front of virindi. What could this 
    mean?&quot;</font></span></p>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I understand the famous cartographer Alatar Locke has 
    been spotted. He has been busy making maps of Dereth. I saw one hanging on 
    the wall of my brother's place. I had no idea Dereth is so big!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you been to that place near the ocean's edge 
    southeast of Aerlinthe? I have no idea what that thing in the water is but I 
    don't like the looks of it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Some of the existing cottage and villa settlements 
    are growing! They seem to be in many locations- the desert, the plains, lots 
    of places.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I have heard that the High Queen may soon call the 
    people to her so that she can explain to us what danger we now face. I would 
    sure like to be there to see her.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News, the Exploration Society has lost contact with 
    the researcher they sent to study the Grievvers afflicting Stonehold. 
    Vivaina, the Stonehold Shopkeep, says he left Stonehold two weeks ago, 
    following tracks into the Northwest Woods.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I cannot tell you how relieved I am that those 
    dreadful statues have finally been nullified - even their pedestals have 
    been nullified. But there are still statues lurking in the foundries beneath 
    them - we'd better keep watch over them, just to make sure they never invade 
    us again.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Scriveners' Guild has set up shop in many towns 
    throughout the world! Visit your local scrivener to purchase scrolls and 
    casting foci!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;A Sharpshooter has reported spotting the missing 
    Exploration Society Researcher, Verdentine Magnan. The archer says that 
    Magnan was busy talking to himself on a hill overlooking a valley heavily 
    infested with Grievvers in the Northwest Woods at 75.5N, 20.6W.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I bought a rumor about someone named Slithe Tradittor 
    who saw an ancient artifact and... well, you go buy it yourself!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;High Queen Elysa Strathelar is planning on calling 
    people to the Festival Stones according to rumors spreading throughout the 
    Arcanum. Some people have even said that Asheron will be there. Well I just 
    hope Martine knows well enough to stay away.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;That thing rising from the ocean? It looks like 
    something that those Empyrean would have used. Maybe Nuhmudira was right 
    after all.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Novice mages will no longer have to 
    perform research in order to learn their new spells! Scrolls are being sold 
    across the land in the Scrivener's Vaults!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;My new casting foci are so handy! Can you imagine it? 
    I only need this foci, a couple scarabs and one of those newfangled 
    prismatic tapers and I'm all set for a hunt!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I bought a rumor about someone named Slithe Tradittor

    Anyway, the deal was too good to resist and it's available only from Coron 
    Usgin in Zaikhal!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum has built a new place for themselves 
    close to Xarabydun. They call it the Consortium. It houses their great minds 
    that are constantly working on efforts to improve life for us.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The townspeople of Stonehold have been complaining 
    about Grievvers raiding their livestock. The Exploration Society has been 
    asked to look into the issue.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;All citizens of New Aluvia beware! The statues 
    menacing the towns across the land have redoubled their attack - they are 
    now unleashing the magic of war upon our already beleaguered townsfolk! 
    What's more, their replicas are answering their summons with an even greater 
    frequency. What will become of our towns if the way to stop them isn't 
    found?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell that Balthazar and the rest of the Royal 
    Guard have been busy outside of Lin, trying to get that portal ready for 
    adventurers to enter.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Consortium workshops have finally sent the 
    Arcanum Researchers a report on their findings about the statues - perhaps 
    if you went to visit them in Cragstone, Zaikhal or Hebian-To, they will be 
    able to tell you more.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Are you thinking of getting a Horn of Vigilance? Then 
    go see Coron Usgin in Zaikhal. Has he got a deal for you! And you can only 
    hear about it here, through Town Criers! Go see him today, won't you?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you ever noticed how all the Statues look 
    exactly alike, down to the last detail? I keep wondering...well, I'd better 
    leave that to people who know better about such things.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The Town Crier slowly turns to you, then suddenly goes wide-eyed at what has 
    appeared behind your shoulder. <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Quick! Behind you! A statue!&quot; <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I'm sorry, I've been so jumpy of late - they've been 
    appearing and reappearing so much recently, but I must have only imagined 
    it. I remember the peace of the old days, and you know, it just bring tears 
    to my eyes.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The Town Crier lowers their voice. <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;It's true, he's sent a new emissary, it stands near 
    one of the windmills outside of Eastham. He hasn't forgotten about us at 
    all. I haven't been to the windmill yet, but I certainly cannot wait to see 
    what his emissary has to say. I knew Asheron wouldn't abandon us.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Poor Nuhmudira, who knows what is going to happen to 
    her, so many people, so many choices. Hey which pull did you make?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum Tinkers have finally built their 
    workshops out in the sands near Xarabydun. The peace and quiet is so 
    absolute out there, I can see why they chose it.&quot; </font>

    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;I visited a friend of 
    mine in her house the other day and she had this beautiful Ursuin hide rug 
    on the floor. I asked her how she got it. She showed me the scars and said &quot;Ursuin 
    Slasher,&quot; and something about a leathercrafter at Bandit Castle, but by then 
    I wasn't listening.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Have you seen those new crystalline weapons? My 
    cousin had one. He said that he didn't care for it too much when fighting 
    without an elemental stone.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin said that 
    the new weapons made from pyreal were nothing spectacular. But then he put a 
    fire stone in his sword and waded in amongst some Shivvers.&nbsp; Scary, scary 
    stuff.&nbsp; No ordinary fire sword could have caused that carnage.&quot;</font></p>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I can tell that Spring has come at last! Have you

    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Something seems to be wrong with the Agents of the 
    Arcanum. I've heard some nasty rumors about their leader. Did you know what 
    she did to her most trusted advisor? Well, I'm not going to get in the 
    middle of this.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;A traveller from the Plateau Village informed me he 
    spotted some fine, new houses southeast of there. Abundant hunting in that 
    locale. But are you the hunter or the hunted?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I bought a rumor at a tavern about a man who is 
    trying to track down what happened to his older sister. He offers a reward. 
    His name is Glysander Cartoth and he lives in Cragstone.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;My cousin said something about finding odd amulets 
    from some creatures that he had been hunting... They look pretty useless. 
    There is a Royal Guard outside of Lin guarding a warehouse though--he might 
    know something about them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Agents of the Arcanum have provided us with 
    residential quarters for communal defense! Remember, there is safety in 
    numbers! You can get to them through portals from the capitol towns of 
    Zaikhal, Hebian-To and Cragstone.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Town Crier turns to you with an air of panic and starts to whisper 
    hoarsely.<br>
    &quot;Have you seen the statues lately? I was walking past one to my post this 
    morning, and I could swear it looked as if it was getting ready to pounce! 
    They've gone...bad...somehow...<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum promised they were there for our good! 
    They said they were our reward!&quot;<br>
    The Town Crier looks ready to burst into tears.<br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;How could they have done this to us?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Wedding planners have joined the Arcanum Agents in 
    the nine Nexus towns. All that you might want for the wedding of your dreams 
    are now available in their inventories.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Glysander Cartoth of Cragstone is looking for help in 
    tracking down some letters that Elysa Strathelar wrote to his older sister. 
    His sister is missing and he offers a reward.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Arcanum has dispatched a researcher to the 
    libraries at Cragstone, Hebian-To and Zaikhal. They have sent out a call to 
    all those who could help them find the way to disable the statues--go to 
    them, quickly! You must help our cities destroy the statues!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;I hear tell that there is a man who seems rather 
    pleased with himself up in the area of Stonehold. He seems a little out of 
    place, and he's quite ornery...&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;A hidden library, much like the lost city of Frore...or 
    so I have overheard while in the tavern, here in town.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;The Lugians have recently sent our furniture vendors 
    a shipment of Travos crystal quarried down in their mines. I love 
    mine--they're perfect for flower arrangements!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The Town Crier couldn't possibly look more terrified.<br>
    Town Crier tells you, &quot;Everyone knows Nuhmidira first introduced the statues 
    to the Arcanum...she insisted they would help protect the cities and they 
    believed her. But the statues have started to attack us! Nuhmidira is gone 
    now...and NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO TURN THEM OFF! Run! Head for the hills! Do not 
    worry about me, I must be brave!&quot;<br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News!&nbsp; Creatures of living crystal continue to appear
    across Dereth in increasing numbers. While first assumed to be the rubble of the Gelidite
    Great Work, scholars now begin to wonder if they may not be produced by some other
    source.&quot;</small><br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! An enormous span, crafted from obsidian, has appeared
    over the River Prosper between Cragstone and Arwic. This amazing structure is the largest
    single Empyrean artifact ever discovered.&quot;</small></font><p><font face="Arial">

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Spring has come to Dereth. The land so recently blighted

    Many travelers report being attacked by rabbits attempting to protect their new

    <small>Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! A lurking sense of evil has permeated the entire land.
    Seers and madmen have reported seeing menacing forms during foul weather, and children

    than usual.&quot;</small><br>

    Town Crier tells you, &quot;News! Explorers searching the most remote areas of Dereth have
    discovered several new underground complexes, apparently dating back to the Empyrean Age
