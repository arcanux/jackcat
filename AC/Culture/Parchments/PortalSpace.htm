    <b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Yalani Male</span></font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your vision swims. For a moment, your vision 
    dims. Great wooden doors, intricately carved and glowing faintly green, 
    creak open before you. Before you is a long, wide hall, its cloistered 
    ceilings lit by false stars that mime the constellations of the sky outside. 
    Niches along both sides are lined with candles. No. not candles, but simple 
    silver rods, tarnish blackening the hollows of their fine reliefs. Over the 
    apex of each rod floats a waterdrop of arcane light, rippling as it spins in 
    place. The light colors alternate, azure and violet, casting shadows as 
    faint as wind.<br>
    <br>
    Musical, incomprehensible speech calls your attention to the end of the 
    great hall. A figure stands there, backlit by a roiling white inferno as 
    blinding as the sun. A long shadow, unleavened by the waterlight from the 
    silver rods, paints the marble at your feet. Like an echo, the meaning of 
    the words comes back at you.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Raen Ameranten. Chevaird of the Ialarchess. Child of Atermore, the 
    Alabaster Fortress that Rises from the sea; the Rock which guards the 
    eastern ways of the glorious Imperial Archipelago. You are here required to 
    swear the Rule of Life. Will you walk upon the path of a righteous life, in 
    fear of and in service to the clear Light? Or will you turn aside to 
    darkness, as have others of your order? Speak now, and be cautious; for if 
    an unworthy or insincere tongue dare speak the Rule of Life, it shall be 
    burned from the mouth by the radiance of its holy truth.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to be on the deck of a ship. A 
    ship? There are no. Over the rail you can see docks carved from alabaster 
    and chalcedony. Where? A crowd that roars. Shrill. The clouds recoil over 
    the glittering spires of the city, and black rain descends on buzzing alien 
    wings. The deck lurches - you find yourself clutching the wall of the 
    dungeon.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to stand in creaking jungle. You 
    are running, swinging a sword wreathed in astral flames. A hundred men 
    around you roar as one. There! At last, the ornate blue spires rise before 
    you. Ridiculous lizard-men flap towards you, their eyes glowing. Women 
    dressed in the skins of animals raise their hands, and the ground erupts. 
    You swim forward, wading through a rain of earth and a razor wind of flying 
    thorns. The noise of falling water becomes deafening.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to be staggering up a flight of 
    stairs. A fetor rises from the room below, the stink of the slaughterhouse. 
    They never made a sound. None of them, not even once, not even when the 
    blades began to hew. Men follow you up, slapping each other on the back, 
    laughing too much as they adjust their campaign cloaks. The air is no 
    cleaner above, though. Here the smell is of burning. You sidestep a fall of 
    blue marble. A drunken warrior shouts apologies from the loft above, a 
    purloined silver icon clutched in his stained fist.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem be running down stairs. Men lining 
    the walls grin at you, bowing as you pass. They smell of sweat and blood, 
    their white, star-branded campaign cloaks stained a lurid incarnadine. Their 
    nostrils are flaring. Lips pull back from grey and brown teeth. You hold the 
    torch above your head.<br>
    <br>
    The women huddle together in the center of the blue stone room, watching the 
    men with cool, detached defiance. Is that how it is? We'll see how long that 
    detachment lasts. You nod to the men. One steps forward and wrenches a 
    heretic girl out of the group, bending her arm a way it is not meant to go, 
    driving her down to bruise her knees on the stones of the floor. She does 
    not scream. The beads woven into her hair clack like teeth coming together. 
    He grins, and rips away one sleeve of her vesture with a languid hand.<br>
    <br>
    The room is silent but for the snapping of your torch. A lone bird cries in 
    jungle outside.</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Yalani Female</span></font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem 
      to be sitting before an orb wreathed in sourceless, clean blue flame. 
      Across from you sits a young man, his hands knotted in anguish, his golden 
      eyes flaring with anger. He speaks, the words flowing like the musical 
      speech of the sea peoples of Ispar. Like an afterimage, the words come 
      again a moment later, in your own tongue. &quot;Someone has to do something. 
      They say we may only watch. But the things we see! You cannot believe what 
      she subjects these people to. This mad queen should be cast down!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      You hear words, as if from your own mouth, saying, &quot;But what can you do?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I can do what's right. I'm going back with the next study group,&quot; he 
      says, looking at you carefully. &quot;Maybe. for good.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;How could you stay without being found as something. other?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The man laughs, a bitter thing. &quot;The same way we take our smug notes. We 
      don't hide away in hunting blinds, you know. The life masters create flesh 
      glamors for us. I've strolled through the markets, smelling the crops.&quot; He 
      rubs his head, chin ducking with some faint embarrassment. &quot;Being that 
      short takes some getting used to.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Your vision swims. A wall of arid heat slams into your face, nearly 
      knocking you back. You blink, eyes dry and stinging.<br>
      <br>
      You stand over a raw lava flow. The craggy walls are black stone, scarcely 
      lit by the damask shadows from the liquid earth that rolls and flops 
      beneath you. Down in the flow, figures are moving; constellations of 
      stone, burning white from their inhospitable wading pool.<br>
      <br>
      Your vision swims. For a moment, you stand upon a crest, a frigid wind 
      blowing icy knives through you, the land dropping away from your toes. You 
      stumble back a step back from the precipice, dazzled by the light that 
      skitters and skips across the snowy ground. Squinting, you raise a hand 
      against the light of the dying sun to see.<br>
      <br>
      Mount Esper. But not as you know it. Heat haze causes the sun to dance a 
      jig as the cinder cone's lake boils white. On all sides, people and golems 
      move about. A floating stone pallet is loaded with bars of greenish gold 
      metal; a white-hot golem illuminates the entry shaft it trundles out of, 
      the the echo filling the crater with the sound of a mountain falling down.<br>
      <br>
      You turn to your left. An distinguished elderly woman looks to the west, 
      the clean white light of the sun sharpening the crags of her cheeks. One 
      hand rests on a platinum cane inscribed with fine, elegant calligraphy. 
      Impossibly, you know her friend Ejan made it for her. And impossibly, you 
      find yourself speaking words you cannot guess the meanings of; and you 
      seem to hear it in Roulean. &quot;Shaura... All these things... the great 
      books, the monuments... The Cathedral that stood for eight millenia. What 
      will happen to our works? They'll fall to dust if we're away so long.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Time will come when these things will be again,&quot; the old woman smiles, 
      her silver hair glinting in the waning sun. &quot;Don't worry, my dear. When 
      all has fallen down, you and I will be there to rebuild it, won't we?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Her storm-grey eyes turn away to the west again, like ship sailing over 
      sea. Distantly, she murmurs, &quot;He's a good boy, Resanne. I believe in him. 
      Unlike that daft Emperor who has us make him coins as the olthoi 
      approach.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Your vision swims. For a moment, you see a group of men and women in white 
      and purple. Somehow, you recognize the pattern of the robes; the colors of 
      the Knorr Lyceum. The fabric is torn, sweat-stained, the anonymous faces 
      floating above them white with fatigue. You are jostled and shoved into a 
      group. You blink into the shadows. What.? The adepts raise their hands. 
      Their eyes fill with radiance, growing blinding, growing until you can see 
      the shadow of their skulls. <br>
      <br>
      You fall into the silvered tube of portalspace. It snakes and writhes, 
      following safe courses through dimensions no eye can see, and magic can 
      scarcely chart. And then...<br>
      <br>
      The tunnel does not collapse as it always does. It peels open. You are 
      weightless, formless, tumbling through an empty violet abyss. So tired. 
      Sleep.<br>
      <br>
      And something, somewhere, tears a little more.<br>
      <br>
      Your vision swims.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Crackflash.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      A column of blue light, vague as smoke, shimmers briefly in the distance.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Am I awake? He said we would -<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Crackflash.<br>
      There's something moving in the light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>
      Violet light.<br>

      The vision releases you abruptly, leaving you trembling and breathless.<br>
      <br>
      <b><span lang="en-us">Lilitha</span></b></font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Lilitha tells you, &quot;Does 
      that one see the hand? It is not the box's hand. They took that. They put 
      it in a glass bubble and it turned into fog. They attached the box to this 
      one later. Sometimes the hand talks to the box.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha reaches toward you, and absently gropes her own face. She seems 
      confused.<br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;That one is... The box hasn't seen flesh poison in... 
      in a long time.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;Person. The box meant person.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;They took the box outside in a cloud. It's nothing but 
      purple. You could fall forever, and everything was bent this way and that. 
      But in some places there were blue ribbons that crackled and danced.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;There were things around the ribbons. They looked like 
      glowing water and trailed strings of jelly. They turned as the box went by 
      and poked each other with the jelly-strings. They were the size of houses. 
      Maybe. Size doesn't work right outside.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;Temenua. That one caught the box as it slept. It 
      brought the box to a child, and the child gave it to these things.&quot; <br>
      An angry blush colors Lilitha's cheeks, and an unexpected gleam rises in 
      her eyes... <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;It BOUND me. No one EVER --&quot; <br>
      ... but a faint, glissando shriek comes from her head. She flinches, and 
      the gleam dies as quickly as it came.<br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;The box attends the master.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;Attentive.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha blinks at you uncomprehendingly. Lilitha inclines her head toward 
      you and waits, numbly expectant. <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;They took the box apart twice. First they looked for 
      what was inside the box, but they said it was empty. Then they wanted to 
      know what made the box go.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;They did it with blue lights. They drew lines on the 
      box and it fell to pieces.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;They wouldn't let the box move. The box watched it 
      happen, until the light reached its eyes.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;It... hurt me...&quot; <br>
      Lilitha abruptly falls to her knees and begins to retch, hugging herself 
      tightly. <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;Does that one see the hand? It is not the box's hand. 
      They took that. They put it in a glass bubble and it turned into fog. They 
      attached the box to this one later. Sometimes the hand talks to the box.&quot;
      <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;Why is that one on the other side of the wall?&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;They brought a man here once. They split him open and 
      scooped out his insides. They made a pile, like sticky fruit. Then they 
      put other things inside him that glowed red and purple.&quot; <br>
      Lilitha tells you, &quot;One of the Masters said they learned how to do it by 
      studying the box. It said the man's name was Martine.&quot;</font></span></p>
