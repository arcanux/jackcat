    from TD<span lang="en-us">.</span><br>
    <br>
    I looked on your website, it's not there, so I
    think no one ever saw that<br>
    As member of the TDork, I
    did the quest in a Tusker T-Shirt,
    Tusker Mask, and
    Towel. Speaking to Bobo 
    he, told me the following 
    (since I was wearing a tusker mask!):<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99" face="arial">Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;Well my fine 
    tusker friend if you want the full story of how I came to be you have come 
    to the right place, for only I know the full story for only I am Oolutanga.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;I was a subject of testing by the 
    virindi. A cruel virindi named Aerbax. I was once a lowly slave being tested 
    on and treated very badly.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;My head was knocked open many times 
    as they played with whatever it is inside of Oolutanga's head until finally 
    Oolutanga spoke for the first time, and since I am Oolutanga it was me who 
    was speaking because I am Oolutanga.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;Oolutanga was then able to do other 
    things, like cast great powerful spells that no other tuskers could do 
    because they were not Oolutanga. Because Oolutanga is me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;Then Oolutanga realized that he could 
    be free so he left when Aerbax came back no more. Then he came here and 
    found people living on this island. They looked squishy and tasted bad and 
    Oolutanga almost choked on their bones when he ate them.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;But then there were the Chittick and 
    they were squishy in the middle and they taste good so Oolutanga eats them 
    instead. But soon Oolutanga because he is so smart, because he is me, found 
    that the people living here were afraid of Oolutanga cause he ate some of 
    them even though they tasted bad and were bony in the middle.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;Oolutanga talked to them but they 
    were not talking cause they did not understand Oolutanga, but Oolutanga the 
    smart tusker that he is learned their language and then spoke to them again 
    and they listened.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;He found out that they were more 
    afraid of the Monouga that lived on the island in a big hole. So Oolutanga 
    went to fight the monouga.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;Oolutanga bested the monouga in 
    combat and though I lost my hand because it is I who am Oolutanga he won. So 
    he went back to the people and showed them the head that Oolutanga, who is 
    me, that he had taken from the monouga.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;So Oolutanga made himself king, but 
    they talked too much and Oolutanga thought they were dumb because they were 
    not as smart as me because I am Oolutanga. So he told them to tie a big rock 
    to his arm where his missing hand was.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;So then he bonked them on the head 
    and made them more like Oolutanga. But I who am Oolutanga grew lonely and 
    then wanted to bring others like you who are not Oolutanga to the island so 
    that I who am Oolutanga would not be alone and the only tusker that was free 
    and now we have our home and eat chittick because they are like jelly in the 
    middle.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;I just told you that story because I 
    am Oolutanga the one who lived the story but you do not understand me 
    because you are not Oolutanga therefore you are too dumb to understand what 
    I say.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oolutanga, the Tusker King tells you, &quot;I am still lonely.&quot;</font><br>
