    have such a fine business and such a fine town. High Queen Elysa be 
    praised!&quot;<br>
    Belthew Shearstone the Jeweler tells you, &quot;Enjoy the days, the nights and 
    moments in between, the winter snows may blow and howl but in springtime 
    leaves are green. Hee hee! Have a glorious day!&quot;</font></p>

    you, &quot;The work was arduous and the wait was long, but we are finally home. 
    Now what can I do for you?&quot;<br>
    Carsith the Weaponsmith tells you, &quot;Though my melancholy has yet to leave me 
    completely, I wish you well in your endeavors.&quot;<br>

    Cateril Carsmad the Armorer tells you, &quot;Ketnan is gone and we have Arwic

    &quot;It's good to be back, that's for sure. But I wonder why the golems moved 
    underground?&quot;</font></p>

    had longed to behold.&quot;</font></p>

      <font color="#FFFF99" size="2" face="Arial">Harald the Fletcher tells you, 
      &quot;I'm still not sure about all this. But the High Queen says its safe here 
      and Nuhmudira supposedly thinks well enough of the area to build a school 
      someday. Maybe then it's safe. But I intend to watch my back, you should 
      as well.&quot;<br>
      Harald the Fletcher tells you, &quot;Keep an arrow nocked, better prepared than 
      sorry.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Magus Guthima the Wise tells you, &quot;Hrmph! Once again this den of thieves 
      creeps back in. I thought I was rid of them, and their conniving ways. 
      Just as Ketnan goes and wanders off the rest of the creeps return to make 
      my life miserable. Be quick about your purchases you. I'm not in the best 
      of moods today.&quot;<br>
      Magus Guthima the Wise tells you, &quot;If you intend on making your way 
      through town you'll be best served by holding your packs closed. Greedy 
      minds and wandering hands have a tendency to lighten purses in hives like 
      this.&quot;</font></p>

      &quot;We're back and doing better than ever. I knew that all would end well and 
      thanks to the High Queen things are back to normal. What can I get for 
      you?&quot;<br>

      that depression leads people to the tavern. But I must admit that 
      celebration is another great cause for merriment. Thanks be to the High 
      Queen for this gift of a new Arwic!&quot;<br>
      Barkeep Mae Lilidag tells you, &quot;No more shadows here. I even hear that 
      Nuhmudira is going to build a school here soon.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Shopkeep Mirinda tells you, &quot;Arwic will soon be back to how it once was.&quot;<br>
      Shopkeep Mirinda tells you, &quot;Arwic will soon be back to how it once was.&quot;<br>

    walloped me over the head real good when I arrived here.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brighteyes, the Tailor tells you, &quot;I was immediately grabbed after walking 
    through one of those purple swirling portals on Ispar. One of the big 
    walking rugs here grabbed me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brighteyes, the Tailor tells you, &quot;I said, 'Get your hands off me you damn 
    dirty...' then Wunk! A big stone caps me on the head.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brighteyes, the Tailor tells you, &quot;They did it to everyone that came here. 
    No people come here anymore though. Stopped about a year ago.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brighteyes, the Tailor tells you, &quot;I am the leader and only member of the 
    human resistance here in this world gone mad. If you bring me proof that 
    you're fighting against these...these...tuskers. I will reward you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brighteyes, the Tailor tells you, &quot;Give me one of their tusks and I'll be 
    sure to reward you well.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mayor Ko Ko tells you, &quot;Me like nanners.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mayor Ko Ko tells you, &quot;Bobo king, me watch village.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Twitch tells you, &quot;Where am I? These tuskers grabbed me and pointed at the 
    volcano and made lots of grunts. Then one of them whonked me on the head and 
    next thing I know I'm chained up here.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Twitch tells you, &quot;You don't think they mean to throw me in, do you?&quot;<br>

    Twitch tells you, &quot;Haha, no, they wouldn't do that... I mean, why would 
    they?&quot;</font></p>

      Timon Rae tells you, &quot;Hello! You are a human, I can tell by your canter. 
      Yes I am Virindi, but I am loyal to Martine, what my fellows did. 
      Horrible.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Timon Rae snickers.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Timon Rae tells you, &quot;Okay, it's really one of 
      Martine's tricks. A cunning disguise, No?&quot;<br>
      Timon Rae tells you, &quot;I'm a scholar. Martine asked me to tell anyone that 
      kills the darned things what their leavings mean. I don't translate 
      though. Can't read a book for nothing.&quot;<br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Remmick tells you, &quot;The farms are still producing. 
      But some of the people that are down there helping me appear to be a lot 
      more shady than before. I almost wish that there was a way to get Martine 
      back.&quot;<br>
      Remmick tells you, &quot;But is not likely to happen&quot;<br>
      Remmick tells you, &quot;I don't think that he is dead though. Hard to kill 
      that man. His spirit never died.&quot;<br>
      Remmick tells you, &quot;No, sir. I think that he as at home right now with 
      Melanay and Arrita enjoying a nice cup of green tea.&quot;<br>
      Remmick tells you, &quot;It's certainly a much more pleasing thought, don't you 
      think?&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;It was you people that 
      brought Martine to his end. You and your meddling. Why couldn't you have 
      left him alone?&quot;<br>
      Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;He was finally becoming happy, but then you had to 
      come down here and cause your ruckus and look where we are now.&quot;<br>
      Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;Everything is falling apart and your hands are 
      tainted. Your hands are covered in his blood.&quot;<br>
      Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;You make me sick.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ichi Ji tells you, &quot;I've never had a customer that 
      didn't live down here with us before. This has been an odd time. Now you 
      people are crawling all over the place. There's nothing to see here.&quot;<br>
      Ichi Ji tells you, &quot;Okay you got your wares, outsider, now move along!&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Julian Bartok tells you, &quot;Since Martine... left the 
      simulacra that used to assist me in the armory have begun acting strange.&quot;<br>
      Julian Bartok tells you, &quot;It's starting to become a chore to keep them in 
      line. But so far so good. Hibdin is a good man, but the things down there 
      don't listen to him the same.&quot;<br>
      Josef says, &quot;Psst! Buddy!&quot;<br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sialla Jiro tells you, &quot;Weclome. We never have had 
      visitors before. It's good to see new faces.&quot;</font><br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Leandra tells you, &quot;Without him my research seems to 
      have lost much of its validity, but then again there is still much that I 
      can learn on my own. But I miss him.&quot;<br>
      Leandra tells you, &quot;We all do.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;You cannot blame Ambrosia. 
      It wasn't her fault.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;No matter how much I tell her that I understand 
      though she keeps rattling on that she hopes I will forgive her. These are 
      dark times for us here below Rithwic.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;When Martine... died. Well things started to fall 
      apart. We've got a handle on things right now but there is no telling how 
      long we'll hold out.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;For now I am the acting leader, or so I've been 
      told. I'm doing my best to hold things together, but the minions that 
      Martine once commanded have become a little more, ornery and free willed. 
      I can only hope that things remain peaceful.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos says, &quot;If you have a moment to spare, please come talk to 
      me.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;It wasn't me you see? I 
      never meant to say all of those things. I struggled against them, I didn't 
      want to say those horrible things and look what I have done. I hope that 
      Hibdin can forgive me. Curse you Gaerlan.&quot;<br>

      one of you outsiders would make your way over to me. The names Josef, and 
      before you ask no there's no surname. Just Josef. Don't ask cause I ain't 
      tellin'.&quot;<br>
      Josef tells you, &quot;Now listen up, and listen up well cause i don't like 
      taking to much time in repeating myself. It makes me waste precious air 
      and that's not fun.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Josef clears his throat and then drops his voice 
      into a deep whisper.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;A while back the boss, Martine, 
      was planning on opening the way to Marae Lassel. A new home for people. 
      Thing is there were people there already, like us but they grew up 
      different. No big deal right? Well the thing is when he did his spell or 
      whatever something else happened.&quot;<br>
      Josef tells you, &quot;He finished his little trick and suddenly a portal storm 
      hit the center of the living area here. Portal energy was whipping off the 
      walls and down the corridors. Next thing we know there's a guy sitting in 
      the middle of the room, naked as the day he was born and about eight, 
      maybe nine feet tall.&quot;<br>
      Josef tells you, &quot;He was real confused. Had no clue where he had come from 
      or where he was, just his name. Gaerlan. And he said over and over 
      again...is Asheron among you.&quot;<br>
      Josef tells you, &quot;Now here's the rub. I know a lot more than that, but I 
      need some help. So you help me...I help you. Take this.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Josef gives you Josef's Wish List.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;Get me the things on that list and 
      I'll talk. It's simple really.&quot;<br>
      Josef says, &quot;Watcha lookin' around for? That was me that called you.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Julian Bartok tells you, &quot;Hey there friend. You look 
      like you already have some fine protective gear.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Julian Bartok snickers.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Julian Bartok tells you, &quot;I've not seen your face 
      before have I? The name is Bartok, Julian Bartok. I handle the armory 
      here. If you ever have need of armor come see me and we'll see what we can 
      get to you.&quot;<br>
      Julian Bartok tells you, &quot;Though when I am here I'm off duty so I'm liable 
      to forget what it is you needed or wanted.&quot;</font><br>

      <font color="#66FF99">Leandra smiles gently.<br>
      Leandra shakes her head.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Leandra tells you, &quot;Hi there. You're new. Are you to 
      help Martine? Hey wait a minute. Where did you get...No you're obviously 
      not new. You don't really belong here do you?&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Leandra smiles gently.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Leandra tells you, &quot;We knew that we couldn't keep 
      this place hidden forever. We were truthfully just relying on the kind 
      hearted nature of Martine to make the transition back to the others a 
      little easier. But now.&quot;<br>
      </font><font color="#66FF99">Leandra shakes her head.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFF99">Leandra tells you, &quot;Poor Martine. I worked 
      with him you know as his Chief Alchemist. Still do. We've done some 
      interesting things. But then again I've heard you have up there too.&quot;<br>
      Leandra tells you, &quot;Enjoy your stay here.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Hey there friend. No doubt 
      you've tried the door and found that Martine has sequestered himself away 
      in there. I wish there was a way in. I've been told by Josef that there is 
      a way in. That Josef knows a lot.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Listen. Martine. He's not really a bad guy. He's 
      confused and that got a lot worse after that Gaerlan guy showed up and 
      made things worse. For a while it looked as though he was going to beat 
      that thing inside his head. But then that Gaerlan guy kept...reminding him 
      and telling him to seethe and grow into the anger.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Hibdin Velos sighs.<br>
      </font><font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;My companion 
      Ambrosia thinks the only way to save Martine is to make him remember his 
      hate. I think it's the exact opposite. A long time ago he was in love with 
      his wife. He still has a love letter or two in his room.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;If you can find that and bring it to him, I know 
      that he'd snap out of this and do the right thing by all of us.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Of course, you should listen to Ambrosia some, 
      she has other ideas.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos says, &quot;Yes, I used to drink but Martine 
      brought me out of that.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos says, &quot;I haven't touched a drop in nearly two years now.&quot;<br>
      Hibdin Velos says, &quot;He's a good guy deep down. I never failed him because 
      he never failed me.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;So you came here looking 
      for Martine did you? Well...then that's good. You see the Master lies just 
      inside this room. Only problem is we can't get in by any conventional 
      means.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe shakes her head and clucks her tongue.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Of course if you listen to 
      what Hibdin has to say the Master just needs to find his focus again. Ha!&quot;<br>
      </font><font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe lowers her voice to a whisper.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Hibdin of course is just a 
      little crazy. He was a drunkard when Martine found him. Wasting his life 
      at the bottom of a bottle. What Martine needs is to remember his rage and 
      direct it back at Asheron. Elysa slighted him for that fossil. That thing 
      from a bygone age when the world was...&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe shivers and stares into space for a 
      moment.</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;I'm sorry. You should help 
      Martine. There is an entryway to his study around here somewhere. Go there 
      and find a tusker husk. He blew it up you see, with the power of his 
      mind.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Collect it, bring it to him 
      and wait for the fireworks as he gets prepared to go and kill the Old 
      Man.&quot;<br>
      Ambrosia Roe says, &quot;Hibdin has no idea what he's talking about.&quot;<br>
      Ambrosia Roe says, &quot;Hibdin, are you sure you don't want another drink?&quot;<br>
      Ambrosia Roe says, &quot;Don't listen to him, he's drunk again.&quot;</font></font></span></p>

    Nathious Agoren the Jeweler tells you, &quot;Please come again... and please, 
    help us.&quot;</font></span></p>

		<font color="#FFFF99" face="arial" size="2">Otto Selino tells you, &quot;I am ever fascinated by 
		the new constellations viewable from this world. I wonder, are these the 
		same stars I saw on Ispar, but viewed from a whole new angle? Or are 
		these completely different stars altogether?&quot;<br>
		Otto Selino tells you, &quot;When I contemplate the vastness of existence... 
		well, it makes me a little ill, it does.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Vettorio Bilcone tells you, &quot;Before we took this town, Salvito and I 
		made a wager as to exactly how long the fight would last. I am happy to 
		say that I won that wager. Five minutes of fighting, it was. And most of 
		that was spent regrouping after we portaled in.&quot;<br>
		</font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Turino Ribini tells you, &quot;The King has 
		commissioned me with the most important of tasks. I am to tax the life 
		out of the Bloodless on this island. They have many pyreals squirreled 
		away in chests and mattresses. But soon that will change. We will bleed 
		these dogs dry.&quot;<br>
		</font></font>

		Salvito di Marden tells you, &quot;Welcome to the Viamontian town of 
		Bluespire. Watch your step.&quot;</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>

    tells you, &quot;Varicci's invasion has certainly made me regret my decision to 
    settle down here. However I will still exchange new style Canescent Robes 
    for older ones, and vice-versa. Just don't get that Eliza angry at me, that 
    woman has a cruel tongue!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mazur ibn Stounis tells you, &quot;Have you any word of Britana? I can barely 
    sleep at night, my heart is sick with worry for her. Varicci's men dragged 
    her off solely because of her brother! And now I am told I must aid this 
    Eliza woman or share Britana's fate! I tell myself that I can do Britana no 
    good imprisoned, but... at any rate, I will still aid you in the crafting of 
    robes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Shalon ibn Mayar the Collector tells you, &quot;I am looking for Carenzi Burrower 
    pelts, Littoral Siraluun claws, Drudge charms, and Sand Golem hearts. I will 
    pay highly for them, despite Varicci's occupation.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Kasin ibn Sayrak the Barkeep tells you, &quot;Please, come in and rest. It's been 
    so difficult since Varicci's men took over.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Kasin ibn Sayrak the Barkeep tells you, &quot;Have you any word from Redspire? My 
    friend Bachus lives there and I've not heard from her since the invasion.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Brother Samir ibn Lomaq the Monk tells you, &quot;Good day, traveler. Do you need 
    any help? Have Varicci's men harmed you?&quot;<br>
    Brother Samir ibn Lomaq the Monk tells you, &quot;If you see my brother Yusnar in 
    Bluespire, tell him that I am well.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Greygor Stillwise the Armorer tells you, &quot;Greetings. Have you come to help 
    us against the invaders?&quot;<br>
    Greygor Stillwise the Armorer tells you, &quot;I'd recommend visiting Anh while 
    you're up here, you can never be too careful.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Yen Loc Anh the Mage tells you, &quot;I knew that the storm was coming, but I did 
    not know its shape.&quot;<br>
    Yen Loc Anh the Mage tells you, &quot;Keep your eyes open. This island is even 
    more dangerous, now that the invaders have arrived.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Misha the Jeweler tells you, &quot;I have so many beautiful things here... 
    please, buy them before Varicci's men come and steal them!&quot;</font></span></p>

		<font color="#FFFF99">Valentina du Lurio tells you, &quot;Welcome to 
		Greenspire, friend. Don't you just love this local color? Such a 
		primitive little town. Reminds me much of those outlying settlements on 
		the border of Aluvia and Viamont. I wonder how quickly it would burn.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Caprice du Bellenesse tells you, &quot;My husband led the invasion that took 
		Marae Lassel. Such a brave, strong man. He has done well in distancing 
		our house from his traitorous uncle. One day, the name Bellenesse will 
		stand for courage and honor again.&quot;<br>
		</font><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Tito Brickicci tells you, &quot;Ah, the glory of 
		battle. It is a wonderful thing, is it not?&quot;<br>
		<br>
    Eliza du Curena tells you, &quot;Greetings. I suppose 
		you're looking for that Britana woman, yes? You'll do yourself a favor 
		if you forget you ever heard of her. She came from bad blood, even for 
		one of the Bloodless, and King Varicci did us all a favor when he locked 
		her away. At any rate, I am a far better businesswoman that she ever 
		could have dreamed to be, and I have taken over this establishment and 
		will continue crafting Mattekar Robes.&quot;<br>
		Eliza du Curena tells you, &quot;They say that there is a great white 
		Mattekar that stalks the northern coast of this island. I understand 
		that its coat can be crafted into a quite excellent robe. Bring one to 
		me, and we'll see if we can do business.&quot;<br>
		<br>
    Romeo Osemmi tells you, &quot;Back off, you. I've a job 
		to do.&quot;</font></font></p>
