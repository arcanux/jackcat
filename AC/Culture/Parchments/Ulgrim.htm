    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey, could you maybe lure some monsters 
    over towards the tower? I'm kinda bored and I could pick them off pretty 
    easy from up here.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some monsters 
    get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health is down, fire 
    is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his throat.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the wand.&quot;<br>

    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've seen some strange things here on 
    Dereth, but why in the world would I want to fling things around with some 
    dead git's extremities?&quot;<br>

    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can't sleep in Ayan anymore. I came out 
    here to try and get some rest at my friends place, but I'm still having the 
    bad dreams. I think maybe it's time to head back to my house for awhile.&quot;<br>

    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I have nothing to do with the blue 
    bandages! Figure it out for yourselves!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So you've heard about Leandra's wonderful 
    new chorizite formula? Yeah, made that same formula years ago, except I used 
    orichalcum. My formula made normal beer mugs larger on the inside than on 
    the outside. I only have the one sample left here. It holds about 30 normal 
    mugs of stout.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good that she's following in my 
    footsteps though, it shows she's very wise.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The monsters are moving again. It would 
    seem that the Virindi are focusing their control on something else. I think 
    they're planning on taking the Direlands over. You should see the way 
    Claudes been smiling at me recently, like he knows something, that smug 
    cloak-head.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Are you standing comfortably?&quot;<br>

    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;As fast as you can.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been studying other people's dreams 
    recently. Tell me your dream and I'll give you a greater insight into your 
    psyche.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Take your time.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What happened then?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Very interesting, continue.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So let me recap to make sure I have it. 
    You dreamed of a Virindi abducting you then strapping you to a weird table 
    and performing horrible experiments on you. And later returning you to your 
    bed as if nothing ever happened?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;This is a tough dream to decipher... I'm 
    pretty sure the Virindi represents the hardships in your life and the 
    experiments being performed on you are situations that you feel are out of 
    your control. Or it's equally possible that you are being abducted by 
    Virindi and you need to move somewhere safe where they can't find you. Good 
    luck with that.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been studying other people's dreams 
    recently. Tell me your dream and I'll give you a greater insight into your 
    psyche.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes, yes, quite common.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I understand.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It was full you say?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's a perfectly normal dream. The giant 
    mugs of stout are symbols of wholeness and well being and the scantily clad 
    barmaids are a sign of a healthy libido and respect for the womanly form. I 
    wouldn't worry about the talking rabbit too much. He never makes much sense 
    in my dreams either.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bah! I told you so!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I had a dream that I was standing on the 
    Obsidian Span and three suns were rising over the horizon. The left sun rose 
    pitch black and cast a dark veil over the land, making it shift and twist in 
    the shadow. The right sun was a deep blue and where it shed it's light the 
    land became as one uninterrupted blue plane without life. The center sun was 
    a brilliant red and it's light came in waves of blood raging up the River 
    Prosper.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A moment of silence for seven lost 
    heroes.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim stumbles and mutters something unintelligible, &quot;Y syh uhla tnaysat ra 
    fyc y piddanvmo. Frah ra yfuga, ra hu muhkan ghaf ev ra fyc y piddanvmo 
    tnaysehk ra fyc y syh, un y syh fru ryt tnaysat ra fyc y piddanvmo.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I tried getting Claude drunk thinking I 
    could get some information out of him. After various explanations of the 
    social aspects of drinking and it's utility in forming emotional bonds, he 
    lifts the stout mug to his mouth hole. The stout pours right through him and 
    onto the floor. Agh! What a waist! That's alchohol abuse! You can't trust a 
    creature that can't hold their liquor.&quot;</font></p>

    coming home. It was great tossing those little tuskies around and convincing 
    the bigger ones that sand is made of nanners.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;But, what's with the name Aphus Lassel? 
    Like a tusker could pronounce that! I was tempted to call it Flying Monkey 
    Island II, but I finally settled on Boboland instead.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Tusker King seemed to like the name.

    the other day. We were having those silly umbrella drinks and he gave me a
