    <td valign="top" width="225"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aun Town Crier tells you, "I will tell you this, tailless one. There are spirits of this island older than our xutas, and older than the ones who came here, built their works, and left again. You may not hear them, but the shamans of the Aun xuta do. You and I have walked under only a handful of moons, but they have stood here since before the moons first rose, and before madness and clarity came."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Each day brings more Isparian settlers to the islands. Our Tah is now in council to discuss how this influx will affect our kind."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "News! A search party has left to find that traitor Hea Toneawa. We believe he is trying to corrupt our younger members to the Hea's blasphemous ways."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Many flights of the moons ago, tall towers of alabaster stood upon the back of great Palenqual. In many of these were hung great metal objects that would speak in mighty tongues at the rising and going down of the sun. So did the ones who came here greet the lights they once served. So have the spirits of this land told us."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Aun Ralirea spends all his time in the wilds of the plateau, among the nuuani. He hunts for our xuta, and they are a worthy food for ritual. You call them gromnies, I think. An undignified name for the race. Ah, but I can see you do not know them as we do."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "This place is sad. Many moons have flown since the teachers fled, and the mother who lost her name was taken away. If you are wise, you will walk softly here, lest you too lose your name."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Our shamen have piled their kindling within the six stone circles of this plateau. One of these lies close at hand, for we built Timaru itself around it. Should the circles be broken, or should our shamen cease their drumming, the shadow of Wharu's children will overrun Palenqual, and eat the sun. But should that happen, the luan societies have already said that they should be pleased to fight in the shade."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "When Wharu had been driven from the back of Palenqual, our mightiest luan warriors girded themselves and descended into the hives, seeking their great mother. In the deepest hive, far underground, she was found and slain. One alone there was. As, I am told, there was one alone on the island now held by the Ispar xuta. The great mothers of the Wharu are fierce and territorial. They do not suffer each other easily."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Beyond our lands, you must beware the raiders of the Hea xuta. Any Hea you see beyond their hovel of Ahruenga will be your enemy. The worst of the lot are Hea Temenua and his band, who prowl the plateau seeking to impose the will of the mad child Aranpuh. They base themselves in the southwest, but range far and wide."<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "News! Carenzi has invaded one of our sacred shrines. Papileona is requesting urgent help in its restoration."<br>
      <br>
      You give Aun Town Crier Pyreal.<br>
      <br>
      Aun Town Crier tells you, "Child, the Tonk have no need of material goods to share information.  We are happy to relate our news of importance.  However, we do need assistance in defending ourselves from the numerous Hea rebels.  I will take your gift as support of the cause.  Thank you!"</font></td>
