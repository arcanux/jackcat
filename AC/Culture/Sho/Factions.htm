    <td valign="top" width="440"><p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small>Here
    are some of the historic organizations known to have existed in the homelands of the Sho.
    How will these groups - and other groups not written of here - fare in the new land of
    Dereth? Your actions will doom some to the dull dust of obscurity, and raise others to the
    fiery glow of fame.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><b>Ryu Jou Gai</b></font><small><br>
    </small><font size="2">Order of the Dragon Temple</font></font></p>
    <font size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;From Discipline
    comes true power.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Background: Founded over a thousand years ago, the
    Ryu Jou Gai is based at the Dragon Temple in the Sho homelands. Those who swear obedience
    to the Dragon Temple dedicate their lives to the warrior&#146;s path. Ryu Jou Gai members
    are also encouraged to keep to all Four Stones of Jojiism. The sword is the Order&#146;s
    primary weapon, but all forms of battle skill, from magic to hand-to-hand combat, are
    means to a common end. Members of the Ryu Jou Gai are also trained to be administrators
    and leaders, which is (some argue) the true foundation of power and the true purpose of
    the Order, especially in a relatively peaceful age.</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Dereth has no Dragon Temple.
    However, the demands of survival in wild lands filled with hostile monsters will surely
    bring about a renewed interest in the study of battle, and perhaps the Ryu Jou Gai will
    rise again. </small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Chiran Jou
    Gai</font></b><br>
    Order of the Unicorn Temple</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;Without compassion, all is as
    dust.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Background: Based at the Unicorn Temple, the ancient
    Chiran Jou Gai is made up of those who have dedicated themselves to the study of magic and
    healing, with an emphasis upon the virtue of compassion. Some are purely scholars; others
    treat the sick who come to the Temple, or go out into the world to help the ailing. Within
    the Temple hangs this sign: &quot;Without compassion, an empire of ten thousand years
    yields nothing but dust that is lost and forgotten. With compassion, an empire of ten
    thousand years even lights the far edge of eternity.&quot; Almost anyone who has been
    shown to be merciful, compassionate, and dedicated to helping others is allowed to become
    a member of the Chiran Jou Gai. Members are encouraged to apply all the Four Stones of
    Jojiism. Funding comes from wealthy patrons seeking medical favors and a constant stream
    of individual donations from the poor.</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: A lone Chiran Jou Gai arrival in
    Dereth is known to have said, &quot;It matters not if the Chiran Jou Gai survives; what
    matters is that compassion itself grows and flourishes.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Chiran
    Jishui Dan</font></b><font face="Arial"><br>
    The Ranks of the Unicorn&#146;s Battle</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;The Unicorn&#146;s Grace shines in
    battle.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Background: The Chiran Jishui Dan
    split off from the Chiran Jou Gai 300 years ago. It is dedicated to the study of battle
    magic, of such power that it has become a rival of the Order of the Dragon Temple, the Ryu
    Jou Gai. However, the Chiran Jishui Dan stubbornly refuses to teach any fighting using
    swords or blades, because &quot;The horn of the Unicorn is never used to cut or
    pierce.&quot; Members of the Chiran Jou Gai remain on polite speaking terms with the
    Unicorn Temple, and though not friendly, are quick to come to the Temple&#146;s aid in
    times of conflict. Rulers have long funded the Chiran Jishui Dan, in order to </font><font face="Arial"><small>win their favor during times of war.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Dereth&#146;s harshness and
    different magic seems to have spelled the death of the Chiran Jishui Dan. However, as more
    and more Sho arrive and take up the study of new magic, perhaps the Chiran Jishui Dan will
    be reborn.</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Washui Iiwah
    Jou Gai </font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Washui Iiwah
    Jou Gai </font><br>
    Order of the Splendor of the Firebird Temple.</p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;True Splendor soars above all
    earthly cares.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify">Background: Historically, the Washui Iiwah Jou Gai
    has thrived during times of peace and prosperity, and has suffered in times of war.
    Members&#146; vows include a renunciation of worldly wealth, and a dedication to the
    higher, non-earthly arts such as painting, music, poetry, and philosophy. They seek to
    observe the ways of the universe and learn its truths. Some philosophize and argue so much
    that critics call them &quot;songbirds&quot;; others seek to depict the beauty of the
    physical world in their works, while at the same time reminding their audience of the
    fleeting nature of physical world. The Washui Iiwah Jou Gai normally survives with the
    patronage of wealthy nobles.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: A lack of wealthy patrons and the
    harshness of life in Dereth means that those who seek to follow the Washui Iiwah Jou Gai
    are facing a tough battle. However, Washui Iiwa Jou Gai-style philosophical debates are
    common in some areas, so perhaps there is hope for this esoteric group.</small></font></p>
    <b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Jojii Zhen
    Gai </font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Jojii Zhen
    Gai </font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Jojii Zhen
    Gai </font></b><br>
    Order of Jojii.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: None</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"></font>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Background: This ultra-conservative
    Jojiist group is sometimes called the Order of Humanity, to fill in the fourth place among
    the Jojiist groups. The members of this group tend to be either generalists, or
    specialists who work in diverse teams. They believe balance is essential. They are also
    immensely strict within their own ranks. As ascetic as the Washui, they have less
    tolerance for a dreamy lifestyle. Jojii Zhen Gai people often wander the countryside,
    offering assistance to whoever is in need </font><font face="Arial"><small>&#150; whether
    it&#146;s a farmer putting up a new roof or a traveler in need of protection.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Some early arrivals have expressed
    the sad wish for the arrival of the Jojii Zhen Gai. Once felt to be no longer needed in
    the homelands, benevolent mercenaries to help those in need would now be welcomed.</small></font></p>
    <b><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Nanjou
    Shou-Jen</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Nanjou
    Shou-Jen</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Nanjou
    Shou-Jen</font></b><br>
    Sons of Shou-Jen. Also called the &quot;Order of the Shadows.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: Unknown. Popularly, it is said that
    &quot;Nothing stands between a Nanjou and his objective.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"></font>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Background: Very little is known of
    this group of assassins, spies, thieves and mercenaries. An ancient order that predates
    Jojiism, the Nanjou Shou-Jen do not follow the Four Stones of Jojii. They do, however,
    believe in strict obedience and stability; as the &quot;sons&quot; (and daughters) of
    Shou-Jen, they are extremely loyal to the Sho people, and believe themselves to be the
    heirs to the Dragon&#146;s power. The group has been an efficient, shadowy &quot;left
    hand&quot; to various powerful warlords throughout Sho history. They believe in following
    their paths with single-minded determination. Rumors imply that particularly notable
    members of the Ryu Jou Gai and the Chiran Jishui Dan, or their affiliated temples, are
    targeted for secret recruitment. The Nanjou is said t</font><font face="Arial"><small>o
    have several hidden temples scattered throughout the Sho lands.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: There is as yet no sign of the
    Nanjou Shou-Jen. Perhaps, new seeds of its revival may planted, but those who wish to do
    such dangerous planting are advised to be cautious, quiet, and wise.</small></font></font></td>
