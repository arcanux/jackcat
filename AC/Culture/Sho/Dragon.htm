    <span lang="en-us">Purchased from Ran Le the Librarian in Hebian-To - 39.2S, 
    81.6E</span></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Once upon a
    time, as Koji traveled the land of Ryujii with her tachi, she decided to go pray at the
    great statue of Jojii at the capital. Near the city, she found a Temple of the Dragon of
    Power beside the road. At the time, Koji mistrusted the Dragon of Power, for everyone
    taught how fickle the Dragon was, but she stopped at the Temple to rest for the night
    anyway. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Toward midnight, the sky suddenly flashed
    with light, and rain began to fall. Koji peered outside the temple and watched as a great
    white serpent descended to the ground. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I am Bairyuu, servant to the
    Dragon,&quot; said the white serpent. &quot;The Dragon has heard that you are a wise young
    woman of exceptional skill. The Dragon now gives you a portion of the Dragon's own Power,
    as a test of your Discipline.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But Koji remembered the Dragon's fickleness.
    &quot;But, oh Bairyuu,&quot; she said, &quot;I do not seek power. I do not want it.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Bairyuu laughed. &quot;You have been given
    Power to call whenever you will, and you shall keep this Power for five years. At the end,
    the Dragon will speak with you to see which of you has won - you or Power, Temptation or
    Discipline. If you fail, the Dragon will devour you alive.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji bowed her head and said, &quot;Then I
    will conquer myself in those five years, that I may win over Power. I shall not use it in
    those five years, lest I lose to Temptation.&quot; And so it was the Koji started down the
    path of Discipline. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>For five years, Koji trained herself in mind
    and body and heart. At the end of five years, Koji was traveling back to the Dragon Temple
    near the capital. Along the way, she came to a mountain. She could not go around, for to
    either side were rivers, and so she had to climb. As the noonday sun beat down upon her,
    the voice of the Bairyuu said, &quot;Call now for your Power, little Koji. With Power, you
    could soon leap over this small hill and be on your way.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;No,&quot; said Koji, &quot;for effort
    and toil is the way of Man, and I have no right to avoid it.&quot; And she went on her
    way, and climbed over the mountain. Thus Koji showed her own Humility. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then Koji was walking along the river. Along
    the way, she saw a tree ripe with delicious-looking apples across the water. But the water
    was too swift for fording. Then the voice of Bairyuu said, &quot;Call now for your Power,
    little Koji. With Power, you could soon leap over the water and take those apples.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;No,&quot; said Koji. &quot;I have
    enough provisions for my journey; I do not need apples to make it, as delicious as they
    look.&quot; And she went on her way, eating her own supplies, and leaving the apples
    behind. Thus, she chose Detachment. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then Koji was walking toward the capital,
    when she came upon a badly beaten man lying beside the road. She tried carrying him, but
    soon she tired. She knew, though, that unless she took the man to the city, he might die.
    Then the voice of Bairyuu said, &quot;Call now for your Power, little Koji. With Power,
    you could pick up the man and carry him easily to the capital.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Yet, this would mean that I have lost
    to Power, by using it,&quot; thought Koji. &quot;But no, that is not as important as this
    person's life. I must use what I can to save him. I call upon Power and I shall face the
    Dragon's maw myself.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Suddenly her limbs were given great strength,
    and she easily picked up the man and carried him to the capital, where his wounds were
    bound and his life was saved. Thus, she chose Compassion. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji now went bravely to the Temple of the
    Dragon of Power. There, the Bairyuu appeared before her again, and said in triumph,
    &quot;You have used the Power of the Dragon at last. The Dragon has at last won over you,
    and Temptation has won over your Discipline!&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But a greater voice than the Bairyuu's
    replied, &quot;You fool, white serpent, you do not understand. Koji has won over herself,
    Discipline has won over Temptation, and true Power has won over false Power. Koji has
    maintained the Four Stones of Discipline, Humility, Detachment, and Compassion; even her
    single use of Power was not for her own sake, but because she placed another's welfare
    over her own. Now, begone, Bairyuu!&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Bairyuu hissed once and fled. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Koji asked of the
    voice. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Does it matter?&quot; it replied.
    &quot;Will it help you keep the Four Stones if I told you?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;No, I see that your name does not
    matter, then,&quot; said Koji. &quot;But please take this Power from me now, whoever you
    are.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;But did you not know?&quot; said the
    voice. &quot;The Power has always been there with you; it has only been made visible to
    you now.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I do not want it, however,&quot; said
    Koji. &quot;Everyone knows how fickle Power is.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The voice replied, &quot;Power is a
    double-edged sword, a terrible force which devours alive its master when used selfishly,
    but which reveals its true glory when used for selfless and compassionate ends. That is
    why the Dragon is said to be so fickle: because the hearts of people are thus.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Koji. &quot;The
    Dragon of Power really is a Heavenly sibling to the Unicorn of Grace and the Firebird of
    Splendor. It is just that, unlike Grace or Splendor, which flee from corruption, he Dragon
    turns against corruption.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the voice. &quot;It
    is in the nature of Power to do so, if it is not kept true to its purpose.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji then understood and went on her way. It
    is said that, even though she had found the Dragon's Power, only those who followed the
    Four Stones of Jojii could see it within her, so carefully did she use it. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>As for the voice, some say that it was the
    voice of the Dragon; others say it was the voice of Jojii; still others say the One spoke
    to Koji directly. But does it really matter? </small></font></td>
