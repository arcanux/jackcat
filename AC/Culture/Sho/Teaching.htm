    <span lang="en-us">Purchased from Ran Le the Librarian in Hebian-To - 39.2S, 
    81.6E</span></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[Herein are some
    of the teachings of Master Jojii. The comments of later scholars are included in this
    telling, enriching and deepening our understanding. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The first excerpt is from a text Master Jojii
    wrote himself eight hundred years ago. He wrote thus:] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>We have all been taught of the birth of
    Mankind. The One who makes all things made the Three Elders: the Unicorn of Grace, the
    Firebird of Splendor, and the Dragon of Power. To the Unicorn of Grace the One gave
    Mankind as a servant. But Mankind grew rebellious, and fought against the Three Elders.
    Mankind, from the many gifts given him by Grace, overthrew the Unicorn and rose to take
    the Unicorn's place. The balance was upset in all of Heaven. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>And so it was the Grace left the world and
    was hidden, Splendor fled and became elusive, and Power chose to become a dangerous and
    treacherous ally to Mankind. It was said that we had lost Grace eternally, and that
    Heaven's doors were shut against us. Only the Dragon of Power now willingly seeks us out,
    and as deposed emperors of the past can attest, the Dragon is prone to jealousy and
    fickleness. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[Master Jojii here wrote only a little on the
    creation of mankind, but it is seen that his understanding was very deep. Students must
    learn that brevity with depth is the mark of a master.] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But, one day, as I meditated beneath a peach
    tree in full flower, a dream came to me while my eyes were yet open. This song came to me,
    amidst a clear shining light: </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><cite>The Unicorn has long rested in Paradise<br>
    drinking in the nectar of the Universe,<br>
    the truth that flows from the One.<br>
    With clear and single eye, seek, oh Man<br>
    the truth that flows from the One.<br>
    Learn of the path of the Universe<br>
    and find rest in the peace of Paradise.</cite> </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[This is where Master Jojii was given the
    vision of the Unicorn. Note how, in the song, that Man is in the center of Paradise, and
    how Paradise is outside the Universe. The truth that flows from the One is all around Man,
    enabling him to rest in Paradise.] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I knew then, through the Grace of the
    forgiving Unicorn, that Mankind can return to Paradise, but the road is steep and hard. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Upon awakening fully from this dream, I
    hastened to the nearest Temple of the Unicorn to pray and offer my thanks. It took me
    three days to reach it, traveling day and night, but I would not rest, nor eat, nor drink.
    When I had bowed low before the Unicorn and had offered my prayer of thanks, I had another
    vision, in that same clear light. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I saw in a vision myself standing in the
    middle of a square, with four stones at each corner. Ahead of me stood a stone called
    Humility. To my right stood a stone named Discipline. To my left stood a stone named
    Detachment. Behind me stood a stone called Compassion. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I knew then that Humility must always be
    before me; that Discipline was my weapon to cleave through all foes and vices, and that
    Detachment was my shield against all hurts and sufferings. And ever supporting me and
    following me was Compassion, which should be the only footprint that I should leave behind
    in life. These Four Stones I saw as the foundations of living, the stones that pave the
    way to our return to Paradise. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[Master Jojii did not yet come to name the
    Stones by the Elders, but we will do so now. The Stone of Humility is the Stone of Man,
    for it is through humility that Mankind grows. The Stone of Discipline is the Stone of the
    Dragon of Power, for discipline is that which breeds power. The Stone of Detachment is the
    Stone of the Firebird of Splendor, for splendor is that which soars above the cares of the
    world. The Stone of Compassion is the Stone of the Unicorn of Grace, for compassion is the
    highest of the invisible graces.] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then I heard a voice say to me: </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><cite>Go now and teach of the Four Stones to
    all the people of the lands of the Sho. Teach that humanity may learn humility and
    compassion, detachment and discipline, and so rise far above the pride and selfishness,
    greed and laziness that brought its downfall so long ago.</cite> </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Seeing the wisdom in those words, I went. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[Master Jojii's first text ends here, but we
    know that he began to teach people of the Four Stones immediately after these visions. At
    first only a few people listened to his teachings. Many said that &quot;Jojiism,&quot; as
    his teachings were called, were blasphemy. We include a record of the debate between the
    Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai, the Order of the Dragon Temple, and Master Jojii. This was
    written perhaps seven hundred years ago, after the Master's passing, by disciples who had
    witnessed the event.] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai said to
    Master Jojii as a test, &quot;I have heard much about your teachings and your wisdom. But
    I too preside over a philosophy that has withstood the test of time. I will ask you three
    questions, and we shall see who is the wiser. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;There once was a sword that could cut
    through anything, and a shield that could resist any blow. Finally, the sword was tested
    against the shield. Which broke - the sword or the shield?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Master Jojii replied, &quot;The shield is
    ignorance, which has stopped many a blow against your beliefs before. The sword of insight
    will cut through the shield of ignorance - but only if wielded by a true seeker.
    Similarly, my teaching is the shield of truth, which, if held by a true seeker, will stop
    the deadly sword of ignorance. So you see that it is the heart of the wielder that
    matters, not the strength of the weapons.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai said to
    Master Jojii as a test, &quot;The Dragon, the Unicorn, and the Firebird are living, moving
    Elders. Can four dead, still Stones be of use to Mankind?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Master Jojii replied, &quot;The Four Stones
    give life to the living, and their principles live within human hearts. The living Elders
    are alive in and of themselves, and because of this cannot live within others. Which is
    more useful, that which is dead and used for life, or that which is alive and does not
    contribute to life?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai said to
    Master Jojii as a test, &quot;The Dragon of Power gave power to the people of the Sho.
    What power will your Four Stones offer us?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Master Jojii replied, &quot;If you cannot see
    the intrinsic value of the Four Stones themselves, and if you cannot see the truth they
    lead to, then you will not see any benefit from them.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai replied,
    &quot;I do not see their value, nor do I see the truth they lead to. I do not see why your
    Four Stones of Humility, Discipline, Detachment, and Compassion are useful to us. I reject
    your teachings utterly.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>As soon as he had said these words, the
    Dragon struck the Master Monk of the Ryu Jou Gai dead, for even the fickle Dragon is
    subject to the laws of Heaven and to the rules of truth. Master Jojii bowed his head and
    prayed for the slain Master Monk, and then went on to teach his wisdom at the Dragon
    Temple, the Unicorn Temple, and the Firebird Temple. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[From that time, those who followed the
    Dragon, the Unicorn, and the Firebird all began to see the wisdom of Master Jojii's
    teachings. Here is the telling of the death of Master Jojii, an oral tradition that has
    been passed from teacher to teacher for hundreds of years.] </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Master Jojii was one hundred and eight when
    at last he passed from this life. He called his students to him, and taught them thus: </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I have had a vision of the four stones.
    Each one built up upon the other. People used them as stepping stones and began climbing
    their way to Heaven. But when one stone was pulled away, the others tumbled down, and all
    the people slipped and fell. See to it that you neglect none of the four. </small></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small>Let humility dwell within you. Without humility you will be
        easily misled and lose your way. </small></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small>Let discipline hone you. Without discipline you will tire and
        fall away. </small></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small>Let detachment guard you. Without detachment you will be
        unable to let go and move forward. </small></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial"><small>Let compassion be in your every thought and action, as you
        strive to help others in their paths. Without compassion you will never be able to enter
        the gates of Heaven, even if they be held wide open for you, for your eyes will be blind
        to them.&quot;</small></font></li>
    </ul>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>And then, smiling, he passed on. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>[But students of the Dragon Temple, Unicorn
    Temple, and Firebird Temple did not heed his admonition, and each Temple took to only one
    path. The Dragon Temple took up the call of Discipline, and the Unicorn Temple took up the
    call of Compassion, and the Firebird Temple took up the call of Detachment. Since none
    focused on Humility, Master Jojii's most fervent followers founded the Jojii Zhen Gai, the
    Order of Jojii, to preserve the truths of humility. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>We, of the Jojii Zhen Gai, recognize that all
    Four Stones must be studied and learned by anyone seeking rest in Paradise, but we know
    that, so long as Mankind is flawed, each person will tend to cling to but one facet. In
    the hopes of one day unifying the Four Stones into the perfection of humanity, we wait.] </small></font></td>
