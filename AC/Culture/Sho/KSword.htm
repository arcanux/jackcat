    <span lang="en-us">Purchased from Ran Le the Librarian in Hebian-To - 39.2S, 
    81.6E</span></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Once upon a time, on a little island not part
    of any of the main Sho lands, stood a little temple, not much more than a shrine to Jojii.
    An old man and woman lived near the shrine, taking care of it, and offering daily prayers.
    They had one daughter named Koji, whom they had trained to be kind, gentle, and a master
    of the wooden sword (for they could not afford a real sword). It was well known that
    winged sea serpents lived in the ocean nearby, and would occasionally come up onto land
    and, in the form of human beings, would trick people, kill them, and eat their livers. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>One day, both the old man and woman were ill,
    and they told their daughter, &quot;Koji, today is a sacred day, the day on which Jojii
    received his vision. You must go to the shrine by yourself, and bless a cup of water and
    pour it over the statue of Jojii. Take your wooden sword. Oh, if only we could afford a
    real sword, like those we used to have before we became poor!&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji comforted her parents and assured them
    she would be careful. So she then went walking through the forest toward the sacred pool
    where she would fetch the water to bring to the shrine. Along the way, she chanced to hear
    a distant voice singing: </small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><small><i><strong>Young Koji it is, my keepers'
    daughter,<br>
    walking along the sunlit path<br>
    all to fetch me some water.<br>
    Careful, Koji, of the serpents' wrath!</strong></i> </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Soon after this, she came to the stream that
    fed the sacred pool. But as she came near, she saw a woman collapsed beside the stream.
    Koji rushed to the woman's side and gently helped her up. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Thank you, thank you,&quot; said the
    woman. &quot;I am traveling to the town of Aku, but along the way I grew weary and fell.
    Please take this as a token of my gratitude.&quot; She gave Koji a tortoise-shell comb. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So Koji, carrying the comb, went on her way
    toward the sacred pool But right before the pool, she saw a man collapsed at the side of
    the path. This, she saw, was Farmer Tan, a farmer from the other side of the island. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said he, as she helped
    him up. &quot;I was traveling on business to Juku when I slipped and fell and knocked
    myself out. Please take this as a reward.&quot; So saying he gave her a rice cake wrapped
    in paper. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So Koji, carrying the comb and the rice cake,
    came at last to the sacred pool, where she dipped a cup into the water, blessed it, and
    then turned for the shrine. But as she walked along the path, the singing voice came to
    her again. </small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><small><i><strong>Brave Koji it is, my keepers'
    daughter,<br>
    who helped two fallen to rise<br>
    on the way to fetch me water.<br>
    Yet one was a serpent in disguise!<br>
    Which gift you received<br>
    Has you deceived?</strong></i> </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji stopped cold when she heard the verse.
    She had received both a comb and a rice cake, and knew not which one might be a false
    gift, made of magic by the serpents to deceive her. Surely either could be very dangerous
    if used: one would be in her hair, the other would be eaten. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Perhaps the comb was the more dangerous, for
    it had been given to her by a stranger. On the other hand, she did not know Farmer Tan
    well, and the serpents might even take on the form of a real person. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So she put down both the comb and the rice
    cake. On the comb she placed some of her hair; the rice cake she broke apart. Then she
    sprinkled some of the water she carried on both and said, &quot;May it be as if I had worn
    the comb, and eaten the rice cake.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Instantly, the rice cake hissed with a great
    eruption of steam, and up sprang a great winged serpent, hissing and flapping its wings.
    &quot;How dare you strip away my disguise!&quot; said the serpent. &quot;I meant to
    consume you from within. But no matter; your wooden sword cannot serve you; it will soon
    splinter and I shall win.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>It attacked Koji, and she beat it back with
    the wooden sword. But soon, as the serpent had said, the wooden sword splintered and fell
    into useless pieces. Just then, though, the comb hissed with a great eruption of steam, a
    fine tachi appeared on the ground in its stead. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Koji snatched up the blade, the finest tachi
    she had ever seen. With it, she easily slew the serpent, cleaving it in two from head to
    tail. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then, with the new sword and with her cup of
    water, she went on to the temple to finish her task. Once she had poured the water as
    instructed, she put the sword on the altar and prayed, &quot;This sword is too good for
    me. I am but the daughter of two keepers of the temple. I return this sword to the kind
    one who gave it to me.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then the statue of Jojii replied: </small></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial"><small><i><strong>Great Koji it is, my keepers'
    daughter,<br>
    who helped two fallen to rise<br>
    on the way to fetch me water,<br>
    then stripped the rice cake's disguise,<br>
    and killed the beast that fought her.<br>
    Koji is strong, and gentle, and wise:<br>
    No snares of unkindness have caught her.<br>
    Keep the tachi, O Heaven's daughter.</strong></i> </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then Koji realized that it must be the will
    of Heaven that she had the sword, so she offered her deep thanks and took the sword. Of
    course, she went on to far greater adventures after that, but that is a story for another
    day. </small></font></td>
