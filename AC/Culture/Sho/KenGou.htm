    <td valign="top" width="437"><font size="2" face="arial"><p align="justify">
    <span lang="en-us">Purchased from Ran Le the Librarian in Hebian-To - 39.2S, 
    81.6E</span></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This
    was one of my favorite stories back in the homelands, that warned of the dangers of
    attachment. I learned it from my grandmother, and now that I am an old man, it is time
    that I teach future generations this tale. Here it is as best as I remember.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Once upon a time, there was a young man named
    Ken-gou. He lived on Chiran-tou, the Island of the Unicorn. Some said that Ken-gou was
    taught by the Unicorn in his dreams, for he had grown to become a most gracious person,
    kind to everyone, and loved by children. Some said the Ken-gou was trained by the Dragon,
    for he was ever disciplined and strong. But his mind was ever on the things beyond the
    world, and so his parents said that his path must surely be with the Firebird.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When he came of age he said goodbye to his parents
    and traveled to the Washui Iiwah Jou, the Temple of the Splendor of the Firebird. There,
    he prostrated himself before the Abbess Joutou, and said,</font></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I beg your approval to study here. I am not
    worthy of the very dust inside the temple, but I would be content even to sit outside and
    listen to the chanting of the monks.</font></i></font></p>
    <font size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But Abbess Joutou said with a smile,</font></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Our dust is less than worthless, so how
    could you, who could clean it for us, be worth less than it? Come inside, and I will test
    you. If you fail, I will suggest you try a different temple. If you pass, you may stay and
    learn.</i></font></p>
    <font size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And so the Abbess tested Ken-gou and
    asked him many questions, but Ken-gou proved to be wise, so she accepted him into the
    Temple. There he stayed and learned. He studied art and poetry and song, and it is said
    that his work was so beautiful that his audience would forget their worries and desires
    and would instead sit in Heavenly contemplation for hours at a time. But Ken-gou was never
    so proud nor attached to his own work that he could not be called away from his poetry to
    clean the dust from the temple.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">One day, the Abbess came to Ken-gou and said,</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>The Emperor has sent out a call for help. The
    Emperor&#146;s servants were cleaning out the depths of the Palace, when they came across
    a great snake wrapped around a golden pillar. The Emperor&#146;s warriors slew the snake,
    but now whenever anyone tries to take the pillar, the person and those around him fall
    gravely ill until the statue is returned to where it was. Curses are forbidden by Jojii,
    and so this one must be broken. I would like you to go break the curse.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ken-gou bowed and said, <i>I will do as you ask.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So Ken-gou set forth and traveled to the
    Emperor&#146;s palace, where he was welcomed as a disciple of the Firebird. Two other
    specialists had also arrived: a disciple of the Unicorn and a disciple of the Dragon.</font></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I will show you the pillar myself,</i> <font face="Arial">I will show you the pillar myself,</i> said the
    Emperor. And so the three were led down many dark steps until they came to a crude room,
    at the center of which, surrounded by many unreadable writings, stood the gold pillar.
    They could sense the angry spirit of the snake, still wrapped around the pillar.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>The pillar surely belonged to an ancestor of
    mine,</i> said the Emperor. <i>So by rights, it is mine. Yet this snake will not let
    anyone take it. Half the wealth of the pillar goes to whoever breaks the curse.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The disciple of the Dragon was the first to act.
    Drawing upon his disciplined powers, he called upon the very Dragon to destroy the snake
    spirit. But the Dragon&#146;s voice said, </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>I cannot destroy a spirit, and you do wrong to
    ask me to attack my own kin. My power will not be used to for that. </i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And when this was said, the spirit snake leapt out
    at the disciple, who was forced to give up.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The disciple of the Unicorn was the next to try. <i>Spirit
    snake,</i> she said, <i>let go the pillar and go to Heaven. There is peace and Grace
    there, awaiting you.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But the snake hissed at her and said,</font></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Never shall I release this pillar, which is my
    precious home! Leave me alone and I will rest here until the end of the world. My only
    desire is to guard this pillar.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The disciple of the Unicorn then said, <i>I will let
    give the spirit my peace, and I will the spirit stay. If we do not disturb it, it can rest
    until the end of the world.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At last it was Ken-gou&#146;s turn. He stood before
    the pillar and pondered long and hard, and at last he said, </font></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Neither force nor compassion alone is enough to
    break this curse of attachment and desire.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">He called the Emperor&#146;s servants to him and
    said, <i>We must melt the pillar, right here within this room. </i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">To the Disciple of the Dragon, he said: <i>Disciple
    of the mighty Dragon! Bind the spirit snake long enough to render it harmless while this
    is done. The Dragon will not be made angry if you hold the spirit only for a day.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Disciple of the Dragon did as he was told, and
    the servants rushed to do as was suggested. Before long, the pillar was being melted down
    at the center of the room. Then, when it was melted down to a fiery liquid, Ken-gou said,</font></p>
    <i><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Now, divide up the gold into a thousand sections,
    and make from them a thousand coins.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This too was done. The Emperor clapped his hands and
    said, <i>Yes, I see now! You are a disciple of the Firebird of Splendor, who knows the
    value of detaching from desires. Now that the pillar is no longer a pillar and is
    scattered into a thousand pieces, surely the snake will give up and go to Heaven of its
    own accord. In reward for breaking the curse of the serpent, I shall give you half of the
    gold as I promised!</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But Ken-gou said, <i>That is not sufficient to break
    the curse. The coins must not be given to anyone within this room; they must be blessed by
    the Unicorn and given to the poor throughout the country. The Unicorn will have compassion
    on the poor, and they will suffer no harm. In this way the curse shall be broken.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Emperor was amazed and said, <i>Can it be that
    you do not want any of the gold?</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ken-gou said, <i>I do not have any attachment to
    things of this world.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Disciple of the Dragon said, <i>A disciplined
    warrior need not rely on gold. </i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Disciple of the Unicorn said, <i>It is best that
    the gold go to the poor.</i> </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And when she had said that, she blessed the coins in
    the name of the compassionate Unicorn of Grace, and the three disciples prepared to
    distribute the coins among the poor. As they did so, there was great noise of hissing as
    the spirit snake faded away to the land of the dead, for it had been freed of its ties to
    the gold pillar.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But the Emperor was angry to see all of the gold be
    given away, because he had so deeply wanted the gold for himself. <i>Surely,</i> he said
    to himself, <i>these coins belong rightfully to me. It is unthinkable that I cannot at
    least keep one.</i> So he secretly kept one of the coins, thinking that no one would
    notice it missing. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As the days passed, the Emperor grew ever more fond
    of the coin, for it was exceedingly beautiful. He began staring at the coin all day and
    all night, and when at last he wasted away and died, his hand was clenched around the coin
    even in death. And thereafter, it was said that the coin itself became cursed --- for the
    Emperor&#146;s spirit hovered over it jealously, not wanting anyone else to have it. Some
    said that the curse of the spirit snake had killed the Emperor. Some said the Emperor had
    turned into the snake.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ken-gou, on hearing the news, was said to have bowed
    his head and to have said: <i>No principle has been truly learned unless it is applied to
    oneself first. To those who willfully and knowingly violate the principle of detachment,
    there is no relief from the curse of attachment. Such a person even the gracious Unicorn
    and the powerful Dragon cannot protect, for it is from one own self that such a person
    must be protected. Perhaps the Firebird of Heaven&#146;s Splendor can someday free the
    Emperor&#146;s spirit from his own curse.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But it is unknown to this day what happened to the
    Emperor&#146;s unhappy spirit.</font></font></i> <font face="Arial"> I will show you the pillar myself, said the
    Emperor. And so the three were led down many dark steps until they came to a crude room,
