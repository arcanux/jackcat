    <td valign="top" width="440"><font face="Arial"><small>The Sho are a people for whom duty
    and self-discipline are the highest virtues. Though generally peaceful, they have raised
    warfare to an art form and a philosophy. While they are slow to be moved, they make
    formidable enemies - or lifelong friends.<br>
    <br>
    The Sho have long been geographically separated from most other cultures. Now, on Dereth,
    they find themselves in unexpectedly close quarters with the Aluvians and the
    Gharu&#146;ndim.</small></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>HISTORY</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    In the beginning (the Sho believe) a divine Creator made three divine spirits, the Elders,
    to rule the world: the Unicorn of Grace, the Firebird of Splendor, and the Dragon of
    Power. Humans were created as servants to the Unicorn of Grace. But when mankind forcibly
    rose above his station, Grace left the world and was hidden, Splendor fled and became
    elusive, and the now-jealous Dragon of Power became a treacherous ally. This, the wise
    say, explains much about the world.<br>
    <br>
    The most ancient legends tell how the Sho warred with the Dragon and were driven to the
    edge of the sea. There, the family of Shou-Jen established a kingdom and named it after
    the Dragon (Ryujii) to placate the Elder. However, rival families instead founded their
    own kingdoms upon islands named after the Firebird (Iiwah) and the Unicorn (Chiran-tou).
    Centuries passed, with warlords feuding amongst themselves, mostly in the name of one of
    the Elder spirits or another.<br>
    <br>
    Around eight hundred years ago, the prophet Jojii received revelations from the Unicorn of
    Grace on how to reach Paradise. Jojii then began to teach of four primary precepts, called
    the Four Stones: Humility, Discipline, Detachment and Compassion. These precepts
    incorporated beliefs in the Unicorn, Firebird, and Dragon, and unified them into a single
    whole. This new religion, called Jojiism, gradually became the guiding school of thought
    for the Sho. However, with warfare running rampant, Discipline, associated with the Dragon
    and martial prowess, quickly eclipsed the other precepts and altered the teachings of
    Jojiism.<br>
    <br>
    Two centuries ago, the Emperor Kou rose to power in Ryujii. Though he was only 15 when he
    took the throne, the devout Jojiist knew his destiny was to unite the war-torn Sho under
    his banner. Iiwah he took by force, invading with a massive fleet; Chiran-tou he took by
    peace, marrying the daughter of its ruler and moving his throne there. Then, he quickly
    began reforming Jojiism and encouraging its spread. Thus began the Kou dynasty, and the
    Sho people were at last unified under one Throne and one vision.<br>
    <br>
    The Sho today still enjoy the stability brought by the Kou Dynasty. Monasteries and
    temples provide a solid foundation of education and training for the populace; they are,
    aside from the Throne, the true powers in society. However, old rivalries still remain,
    mostly split along the faultlines of the three Elders and their associated Jojiist
    principles. There are also increasing rumors of secret groups loyal only to the Dragon,
    people who despise both Jojiism and the Kou Dynasty. Meanwhile, trade has begun in earnest
    with the Gharu&#146;ndim and the Milantos, the two nearest kingdoms, and the Sho are
    growing increasingly aware of the vast lands beyond their borders. <br>
    <br>
    The Sho are the most recent people to arrive on Dereth Isle. Surprised to find themselves
    so close to cultures considered far away at home, they have largely kept to themselves,
    pouring their energies into building up their towns and defending against marauding
    monsters. But some wonder: as more Sho arrive, how will they adapt? Will old rivalries
    continue? Will the foundations of wisdom survive, and grow?</small></font></p>

    OF JOJII</strong></font><font color="#eabf68"><br>
    </font><br>
    When the prophet Jojii received his vision from the Unicorn in Paradise, he learned of the
    path laid out by the Creator to reach it. This path is built of four principles, or
    &quot;Stones&quot;, which devout Jojiists seek to obey in all aspects of their life.
    According to the prophet&#146;s teachings, the door to Paradise will open to those who
    build themselves upon the Four Stones of Jojii:</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Humility</strong>, the Stone of Man:
    Respect learning and work, and respect your elders and betters and the divine spirits, for
    the human path is one of humble toil.<br>
    <strong>Discipline</strong>, the Stone of the Dragon: Never give up and do not surrender
    to your weaknesses, for Power grants strength and victory.<br>
    <strong>Detachment</strong>, the Stone of the Firebird: disregard wealth and other
    fleeting pleasures, just as Splendor soars high above the world.<br>
    <strong>Compassion</strong>, the Stone of the Unicorn: be always willing to help others,
    even at the cost of your own life, so as to be a hidden beacon of Grace.</small></font></td>
