	wall and go through to the next set (watch out for the drudge balloons 
	they're very nasty). At the top of the fort is a cottage with 2 banderlings 
	in it and a drudge in front of it. The drudge is hungry and wants ursian 
	shanks. When you have fed [food at 25.3N, 46.0E], you are then able to loot 
	the fort blue print from a corpse of the one the level 110 drudge biters.&nbsp; 
	Once inside of the cave, I have no idea. I have been told there is a big 
	boss that is a banderling. Thanks for your awesome site. Have a great patch

	<p><span lang="en-us">Jorrdane of MT adds: &quot;To do the drudge fort west of 
	cragstone, you have to bring food to feed the drudge inside the walls. To 
	get inside the walls you run around until you see torches and you attack the 
	walls until they fall. Then you make your way to the center where you give 
	food to the drudge. That flags you to pick up the blueprints. Kill little 
	biter drudges until the blue prints drop, pick them up and run around the 
	back of the cottage and give them to the bandie in the window. He then asks 
	for a shovel. To get the shovel you do the Farmer Kao quest and get the 
	shovel, then you take the shovel to the bandie again in the window. He gives 
	you 27 mill and tells you to wait a week before anything else can happen.&quot;</span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Shamrock of LC sends this addition: &quot;Hi Maggie, I 
	decided to go try my hand again at taking out a drudge balloon. The last one 
	I tried to kill took off on me at half -health. Well tonight after about 
	10mins of casting heart rend on it, and doing a whoppin 80 dmge max, it 
	finally dropped to the ground. Cast tusker fists at the outside fort wall (I 
	was fighting the balloon outside the fort) wall came tumbling down, and I 
	ran inside to see the uber loot I was sure would be dropping from the 
	Balloon. No Dead balloon was anywhere to be found &lt;Sigh&gt; So since I didn't 
	check to see what kind of exp I got, I decided to take out another one and 
	keep track. This time I moved inside the first wall, again Heart Rend did 
	the trick. I watched it fall this time. The balloon's basket breaks away, 
	and as soon as it hit the ground it disappeared. <br>
	<br>
	No Loot, No Corpse, and this time it was really disappointing when I did the 
	math and got only 54K exp. Which 54k is more then I had when I started, but 
	surely not worth risking the grenades, and damage and death, for that little 
	of exp. I'd suggest just dodging them, watching your health and don't bother 
	wasting your time and comps. <br>

	happened. That fellow in red burning the windmill, that would be Burnja. We 
	drove off that psychotic little pyromaniac before he could burn the 
	windmill. And we now know that they've built the fort shown here west of 
	town. They used all the things they stole from us to build it.&quot;<br>
	Jarvis Hammerstone tells you, &quot;The only thing I don't know is who this 
	drudge floating over the fort is. The council sent me a lengthy letter from 
	Aliester the Loquacious theorizing that the Drudge depicted there is some 
	sort of magic wielding warlord. I prefer getting more substantial 
	information before I jump to any conclusions though. Let me know if you find 
	out anything else.&quot;<br>
	Jarvis Hammerstone tells you, &quot;Now, for your service to our town I hereby 
	make you a member of the Cragstone Militia, with the knowledge due a militia

	Thanks to S</span>wordsman the player of HG <span lang="en-us">for details

	<br>
	These are the details from my quest into the Mosswart town with Red Norah 
	and Same T’ing Special thanks to both of them for their help.<br>
	<br>
	<span lang="en-us">--</span>Bragara – the chosen one.<br>
	<span lang="en-us">--</span>level restriction - None <br>
	<span lang="en-us">--</span>Recommended - level 100+<br>
	<span lang="en-us">--</span>Element - fire rend<br>
	<br>
	Talk to the army in Kryst to begin the quest Corporal Massein<span lang="en-us"> 
	at 74.4S, 84.6E</span>, Sergeant 
	Brigitta and Guard Hrothgar will give you each quest though with guard 
	hrothgar<span lang="en-us">,</span> it<span lang="en-us">'</span>s more a confession.<br>
	<br>
	After you talk to each of them go to the mosswart town at 78.1S,86.5E and 
	run into the tunnels then go left which should be south at the first split 
	you should arrive at a 4 way intersection. go east and take the intersection 
	turn right which should be south. You will go down a ramp turning east. Now 
	you will fight tougher enemies. Go two rows forward and head right follow 
	past the room and down the ramp to the south.<br>
	<br>
	Go to the 4 way intersection and go west. At the next intersection go south.<br>
	<br>
	At the next intersection go east and you will see bleargh<span lang="en-us">'</span>s 
	shamans. free them NOTE: from what I saw only one will leave so find the one 
	of them that will the others will probably just stand there.<br>
	<br>
	After you free them go back to the 4 way intersection go north continue on 
	till you arrive at two rooms on either side of the hall run past them and 
	head north into the hall you should find a 2 way intersection. Go left which 
	is north. Go south down the ramp and prepare for critters to toughen again. 
	You will see a stack of stained papers to the north rustle through them and 
	then move on. <br>
	<br>
	To kill baraga be carefull he has 50k hp on him and carefull of the mosswart 
	elders that are with him and of his custom debuffs!!! Aefaeles touch 
	decreases all attributes by 45 points for 120 seconds.</p>

	</b>Shamrock of LC reports: &quot;</span>Hi Maggie,<span lang="en-us"> </span>
	Went to Kryst and spoke to &quot;Corporal Massein&quot;. He was standing back by the 
	hill among the patrolling guards (which btw have doubled in strength). He 
	will give you a task to kill 40 Mosswart Townfolk at the Mosswart Holding. 
	(The walled town) Kill them on the grass, in the tents, and down in the cave 
	area. This task goes very quickly.. After slaying 40 of them return to the 
	Corporal and you will earn exp. Not bad for about 3-4 minutes of killing. I 
	didn't see a title message, but haven't gone through my list yet. It could 
	be one of those sneak-em-on-you titles. The kind where once you spot it you 
	wonder 'Where the heck did I get that from!'&quot;<br>

	<span lang="en-us"><b>New Quest - The Archivist!<br>
	</b>Thanks to sworsman the player of HG for details below:<br>
	<br>
	*you must have completed haraags dagger for this quest*<br>
	Restriction - none<br>
	Element - fire and slash virindi slayers, acid, frost and shadow slayers<br>
	<br>
	Speak to the Guard Enmio di Cinghalle at 59.6S, 87.7W and he will send you 
	to the Chaos Virindi Cave at 58.6S, 81.5W to investigate the cave there. So 
	head down into the cave and prepare to fight dolls and virindis. Go NW and 
	arrive at a wall. Head south to a wall then west down a ramp. Down the ramp 
	you will start to see devs. Fight through them and then continue SW. Go 
	straight at the maze you will begin to fight virindi and rifts at this 
	point. At the crossroad go north. Fight the devs and marrionettes that 
	appear and continue south into the big room. Kill the three desecrators and 
	the shadows that will come. After that head to the ramp and go down kill the 
	hollow minions and go around the corner and then NE and then into a series 
	of caverns, and then down either ramp. Kill the two marrionettes you find.<br>
	<br>
	Go down the two ramps and then go north down another and kill the devs you 
	find. Go out the opposite tunnel and kill the marrionette and then go south 
	down the ramp. This is a good spot to rebuff. After you come down, prepare 
	for an onslaught of rifts and hollow minions. Once you clear them away, then 
	go east and kill all the hollow minions there. Go NE now and then west then 
	north and west again, and then west into the big room, then NW into a 
	hallway. Go through the hall and kill the devs there. Up the ramp and to the 
	NW, down a ramp kill more devs, then go SE and up ANOTHER RAMP!!! And then 
	down to a room full of virindi quidoxes. Up the the ramp and then down the 
	SE, and then through the big room and then to the NE and into the archive 
	portal.<br>
	<br>
	The Archive - no level restrictions, Virindis<br>
	<br>
	Start by jumping and killing the V's with hit and run, then go west and 
	follow the halls around. Continue straight SE then north, then SE down the 
	ramp. Again hit and run tactics. Kill around so none follow you down. Then 
	if you have a small group imp and vuln from above so you can kill the rest 
	when you go down. BE CAREFUL SMALL GROUPS!! The Archivist is a level 175 
	virindi. He appears incapable of using war magic and will vuln and cast 
	debuffs and drain, but seems to need his swarms to finish you off. After you 
	defeat him, loot one of the ten shards he drops and get them translated in 
	Zaikhal. After that, return to the guy in Ayan and you will receive xp and 
	the title Royal Investigator from him.</span></p>
