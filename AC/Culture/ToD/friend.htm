    </font></span>&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">High Queen Elysa Strathelar nodded, and the Tumerok emissary took his 
      leave. After he and his retinue had filed out of the throne room, she 
      dismissed her retainers. A dozen Royal Guards and ladies-in-waiting bowed 
      and exited the modestly appointed hall. When they finished their exit, and 
      the only remaining member of the court was Antius Blackmoor, she closed 
      her eyes and rubbed her temples.<p>&quot;The crown weighs heavier these days,&quot; 
      Antius spoke.</p>
      <p>She sighed and looked at him. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;It does.&quot; Elysa 
      stood up and walked to the small serving table against the wall. She 
      poured herself a glass of water from the silver serving pitcher. &quot;You know 
      I never wanted this,&quot; she said. &quot;And now that the Viamontians have 
      arrived, I feel more unfit than ever before. They're going to turn this 
      world into a battleground, and I don't know that I can lead our people to 
      victory.&quot;</p>
      <p>Antius placed his hands on Elysa's shoulders. She closed her eyes and 
      leaned back against his chest. &quot;You are strong, Elysa,&quot; he whispered in 
      her ear. &quot;Much stronger than you believe. You will defeat this threat. You 
      always do.&quot; He kissed her neck and a sharp tingle ran down the length of 
      her spine. She turned in his arms and gazed up at him, a small smile on 
      her face. She placed a hand on the back of his head and pulled him close. 
      Her heart pounded in her chest as he tightened his embrace and kissed her.</p>
      <p>Her skin tingled with an unnatural energy. At first she took it to be 
      the physical sensations of which young love-struck poets so often sing, 
      but the purple light that appeared at the center of the room convinced her 
      otherwise.</p>
      <p>They broke their embrace and turned to the light. Elysa placed a hand 
      on her chest, willing her pulse to slow.</p>
      <p>Three shapes took form in the center of the room. Purple bubbles 
      swirled about, humming and buzzing, slowly becoming flesh. Flesh and bone 
      solidified, and the purple energies dissipated. Three people - Hendac, 
      Jenavere, and a rather worn and obviously frightened Viamontian - opened 
      their eyes and looked about the room.</p>
      <p>Jenavere spotted Elysa, took a step forward, and knelt. Hendac placed a 
      small amount of pressure on the Viamontian's back, forcing him to kneel as 
      well.</p>
      <p>&quot;My lady,&quot; Jenavere said. &quot;I present to you the Viamontian Carlo di 
      Cenza.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center">*****</p>
      <p>He stepped out of the cage onto the snow-covered beach. He had not seen 
      sunlight in months. For so long, all he had known was the stench of their 
      caves, the reek of their food, and the screams of their captives. But now 
      they were releasing him into the world, a dire mission imprinted on his 
      mind. He wanted to rebel from this mission. He wanted to flee to the 
      Duke's protection, but the desire to do their bidding was too great. 
      Whatever they had done to his mind, they had done too well.</p>
      <p>He rubbed his arm where his flesh had been stripped. That limb was hard 
      and twisted now, a gruesome reminder of the creatures' vile attentions.</p>
      <p>The Ruschk shoved him forward and grunted. He took their meaning. It 
      was time to begin his quest. These creatures did not permit themselves the 
      luxury of rest, and they certainly did not allow it of their captives. He 
      willed his body to turn and run, to flee across the icy wastelands and 
      seek refuge within the Duke's stronghold - if it still existed. But his 
      body refused to obey his commands. Instead, he simply nodded to the 
      fur-clad barbarians, then calmly turned and walked east.</p>
      <p align="center">*****</p>
      <p>Sarkin Killcrane had shadowed the cultists for months. The Order had 
      been unusually active of late, sacking ancient tombs and looting tomes of 
      the long-dead Haebrous. The High Queen had commanded Killcrane to haunt 
      their footsteps and discover their goal, but as of yet he had deduced no 
      motive to their actions. However, the nature of the tombs which they 
      penetrated filled him with dread. There was only one reason to search 
      through the tombs of the ancients - power. Dark, malevolent power usually. 
      He feared the cultists had discovered some long-forgotten secret, some key 
      to the dark forces they worshipped.</p>
      <p>The cultists disappeared over a sand dune before him. The desert sun 
      beat down on his back, cooking him in his armor. He stopped and took a 
      long drink of water from the waterskin he kept tied about his belt. He 
      surveyed the desert around him, wishing the Order had instead developed an 
      interest in the newly discovered Halaetans rather than this blasted 
      wasteland. He could do with a bit of that chill mountain air. </p>
      <p>Until now, Sarkin had not stopped to ponder just why they were in the 
      desert. He had assumed the Order members were on their way to yet another 
      undiscovered tomb. But then Sarkin noticed a tingle in his flesh, and a 
      dark fear crept into his heart.</p>
      <p>They were heading south. They were heading in the direction of the 
      Obsidian Plains. Already, he could feel the dark energy of the Bore 
      tweaking his nerves.</p>
      <p>No, these cultists had some other destination in mind. They were no 
      longer in search of dusty tomes and molding libraries. The time for 
      research was over.</p>
      <p>Sarkin loosened his sword in his scabbard. He feared he might soon need 
      it.</p>
      <p align="center">*****</p>
      <p>Commander Kurth shoved his sword into the Tumerok's chest and watched 
      the life fade from its eyes. The body slid off his blade and crumpled to 
      the ground amidst the corpses of its brethren.</p>
      <p>The Renegade assaults had grown increasingly bold of late. The walls of 
      Fort Tethana were more of a battleground now than they ever had been 
      before. The Renegades clung to their mad desire for this small outpost, 
      for who knew what foolish reason. Kurth fought them back as best he could, 
      which was no small feat given the size of his force. He had petitioned 
      many times for reinforcements from the Queen, but she chose instead to 
      send her soldiers in search of shadows and relics, ignoring the very real 
      threats that continued to assault those cities she was duty-bound to 
      protect.</p>
      <p>Kurth returned to his remaining men. Only three had died in this raid, 
      but of course they were back at the lifestone behind the walls. His men 
      looked tired and worn. They were weary of fighting and dying. They were 
      tired of this never-ending cycle of violence. He could not blame them for 
      that. What was all this worth, in the grand scheme of it all? Death did 
      not matter here. Every defeat was but a delayed victory, and every victory 
      a delayed defeat. It would never end. None of this meant a damn thing.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that was why the Queen chose to ignore his pleas for aid. 
      Perhaps that was why she left him and his men out here in the desert to 
      rot.</p>
      <p>Kurth thought once again of the message he had received - the 
      unexpected offer that had arrived the previous night. Kurth had pledged 
      his loyalty to Elysa long ago, and he was loath to break that allegiance, 
      but the Queen had done little to inspire his loyalty these last few years. 
      He had been too long alone in this blasted desert.</p>
      <p>Commander Kurth looked to the north. A glint of metal shone in the 
      mountains above, an emissary waiting on an answer Kurth was afraid to 
      give.</p>
      <p>The commander lowered his head and trudged back to the fortress walls.</div>

		Seneschal Dalmour strode out of the Royal Hall and observed the prisoner 
		before him. The man was shirtless, lash marks covering his back and 
		sides. The man lay on his stomach, a massive knight pinning him to the 
		ground with one trunk-like leg. Five other knights stood watch around 
		the Aluvian captive.<p>Dalmour knelt next to the man and moved the 
		prisoner's sweat-dampened hair from his face. The man glared at him out 
		of the corner of his eye.</p>
		<p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; Dalmour asked the man.</p>
		<p>The man had trouble speaking due to the weight of the knight's leg on 
		his back. But after a bit of struggle he finally spat, &quot;Jasten.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;Jasten,&quot; Dalmour said, &quot;My name is Dalmour. I am the King's 
		seneschal. I understand you bear a message from your Queen.&quot;</p>
		<p>&quot;Y-yes,&quot; choked the prisoner.</p>
		<p>Dalmour nodded his head. &quot;Well, I'm sure it's riveting. But I'm 
		afraid I haven't the time. You see, my King, he requires much of me. I 
		have meals to prepare, reports to write, housekeepers to discipline, 
		that sort of thing. I am afraid your Queen's message will just have to 
		wait.&quot; Dalmour beckoned to one of the knights. &quot;Meanwhile, I'm going to 
		ask these men here to cut off your arms and legs, okay?&quot; </p>
		<p>The knight unsheathed a massive sword and stood over the prisoner. 
		Jasten struggled to focus his eyes on the knight, but was unable to roll 
		over far enough to look at him.</p>
		<p>&quot;They're going to keep you alive though, okay Jasten?&quot; said Dalmour. 
		&quot;So don't fret. You won't die on their watch. They're pretty good at 
		this sort of thing.&quot; Dalmour stood up and took three steps back from the 
		panicked Aluvian. &quot;But in the event you do die, tell your Queen not to 
		bother sending us any more messages, okay? I'm afraid we're just not 
		interested.&quot;</p>
		<p>The knight raised his sword high above his head. Dalmour turned and 
		re-entered the Royal Hall as the Aluvian screamed.</p>

    <div style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 20px">
		<font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
		This month marks the first content update since the launch of <i>Throne 
		of Destiny</i> and we've got quite an event in store for you. We've been 
		very happy with the reception that AC:TD has received from all of you, 
		including a large number of returning players, and we think you'll be 
		very happy with what you'll be seeing in this event. The August event, 
		&quot;Friend and Foe,&quot; is currently scheduled to go live on Wednesday, August 
		17<sup>th</sup>. But before we go into details, there's one other 
		announcement I'd like to repeat.<br>
&nbsp;</font><div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Providence AC Player's Lunch</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">On Saturday, August 13<sup>th</sup>, 
		there will be an Asheron's Call fan lunch at the Dave &amp; Buster's in 
		Providence, Rhode Island. This is a combined event for Asheron's Call 
		and Lord of the Rings Online fans, and is completely fan-sponsored and 
		fan-organized! I'll be attending, representing the AC1 Live Team and the 
		Santa Monica Studio, as will Calandryll (Turbine's Director of Community 
		Relations) and members of the LOTRO team. For more information on date 
		and time, as well as how to register,
		<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?t=24208">
		check out Paraduck's post on the official AC Forums</a>.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now let's take a look at what's coming in 
		the August event and beyond!</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the items that we plan to 
		implement in the August event.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Tumerok Art Upgrade!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In August we'll be using our new graphics 
		engine to upgrade one of Asheron's Call's original monsters, the 
		Tumeroks! This upgrade is similar to the Skeleton upgrade that was done 
		for the <i>Throne of Destiny</i> release. Tumeroks will have more 
		detailed models and textures and will be found wearing stylized armor. 
		This upgrade will impact the Hea, Renegade and independent Tumeroks. The 
		Aun Tumeroks, who have a more recent and more unique look, are not being 
		upgraded at this time.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That's certainly made Hea Arantah happy! 
		He's very proud of his new look!</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><a target="_blank" href="friend/330.jpg">
		<img alt="" src="friend/330_small.jpg" border="2" xthumbnail-orig-image="friend/330.jpg" width="100" height="109"></a></font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">New Loot Weapons!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the August event, we're adding new 
		styles of melee weapons, missile weapons and casters to the treasure 
		tables! From new weapons like the Spine Glaive and Compound Bow to the 
		return of old favorites like the Board with Nail, players will be able 
		to find these new items in loot. They'll be fully tinkerable and 
		imbueable and will be comparable to other weapons in their class, with 
		higher damage wield-requirement and elemental bonus damage variants also 
		available where applicable. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Withered Expansion!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The creatures found in the Withered Atoll 
		– creatures that are immune to all non-projectile magic – are spreading 
		north and southeast along the Direlands coast in the August event. And 
		there are new camps and new quest weapons to be found!</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we've said in the past, the Withered 
		Creatures are one step in our long-term goal of providing a rewarding 
		play experience for those high-level characters that choose not to use 
		offensive Life Magic.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">New Quests!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We've got a lot of great new quests lined 
		up for the August event! We thought we'd tease you with a handful of 
		them:</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Fort Tethana Tug of War!</font></b><font size="2"> 
			Characters level 60 and above can investigate rumors that King 
			Varicci is attempting to capture Fort Tethana through covert means. 
			Will you help prevent the fall of one of Dereth's most well-known 
			towns, or will you aid the King in his bid for expansion?<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">New Hunting Quests!</font></b><font size="2"> 
			Over a dozen new NPCs order characters to hunt specific creatures on 
			landscape. New tech lets you keep track of how many creatures you've 
			killed and how many more you need to complete your quest! There are 
			Hunting Quests for starting characters all the way up to characters 
			over level 140!<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Sepulcher of Nightmares!</font></b><font size="2"> 
			What is the Order of the Raven Hand doing on the Singularity Caul? 
			What hideous servants of the shadows will they unleash? Characters 
			over level 100 can investigate and try to put an end to their latest 
			plot!<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">The Books of Grael!</font></b><font size="2"> 
			Both a Viamontian Royal Agent in Sanamar and an Aluvian scholar in 
			Cragstone seek the mysterious Books of Grael, the records of an 
			ancient barbarian warrior. Characters over level 50 can seek the 
			books and choose whom they wish to help. But wait, why does a 
			Sclavus seek the Books as well?<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Ricardo's Blood Gem!</font></b><font size="2"> 
			A Viamontian Rebel named Ricardo tells of Varicci's pursuit of a 
			powerful Falatacot artifact known as the Blood Gem of Rikt Zir. 
			Characters level 80 and above can seek to capture the Gem before the 
			Viamontian King does!<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Lunnum's Pyre! </font></b>
			<font size="2">A pyre burns in honor of the last female Fiun to 
			survive the Eaters' onslaught and flee to Dereth. The pyre's 
			guardian seeks characters above level 100 to restock the pyre's 
			fuel, so that the memory of Lunnum is not lost.<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">The Hunt for Muldaveus!</font></b><font size="2">
			<a href="http://ac.turbine.com/index.php?page_id=286">Ten months ago</a>, 
			the Burun named Torgluuk turned on Niarltah and Muldaveus, the 
			leaders of the Tumerok and Lugian Renegades. Since that day, their 
			whereabouts have been unknown. Level 80 characters and above are 
			being recruited by a wanderer who seeks to follow the Lugian 
			Warlord's trail!</font></font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">And, of course, there are many other new 
		quests, creatures and items to be found in the August event!</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">In Development</font></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we 
		are working on for the September event. None of these items are 
		guaranteed to be added for September as scheduling and priorities can 
		change. These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons and 
		items that we'll be introducing in the September event. Your feedback on 
		these topics is particularly valuable.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Additional High Level Hunting!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In September we plan to add further 
		hunting environments for high level players. We'll be creating 
		additional versions of some of the existing dungeons, such as the Path 
		of the Blind, in much the same way that there are multiple Black Spawn 
		Dens and Lugian Citadels. We'll also be tweaking the experience rewards 
		of some high level hunting dungeons to make them more valuable. In 
		addition, we plan to add some new and unique high-level landscape 
		hunting. Keep your eyes peeled for some of the teaser screenshots we 
		expect to release in late August or early September!</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">Treasure Improvements!</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We plan to add some new loot items to the 
		treasure system in September as well as upgrade existing items. These 
		include:</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Crowns, hats, shoes and gloves that 
			spawn with much higher Armor Level than can be found currently! Now 
			you can wear that Major Strength crown into battle!<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Cantrips on jewelry and clothing!<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Level 7 spells on loot!<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Increase the damage on elemental 
			wands through spells or tinkering! That high Melee Defense wand will 
			no longer be the best wand in your arsenal!<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Improved elemental protections on 
			Leather, Studded Leather and Scalemail armor, plus clothing!</font></li>
		</ul>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">Global Chat Channels!</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remember when I talked the enormous 
		amount of work that went into the new User Interface back-end, and how 
		this would allow us to much more easily make improvements to the game?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yeah. Oh yeah.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In September we plan to introduce four 
		global chat channels as well as new Chat UI improvements! The four 
		channels will be:</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">General </font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Trade </font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Looking for Group </font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Roleplay</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Players will be able to join or leave 
		these channels in much the same way that they can join or leave their 
		global Allegiance chat channel.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We'll be providing more information about 
		these new systems in a separate article around the same time as the 
		September Letter to the Players. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">In Concept</font></b></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we 
		are thinking about for October and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or 
		even <b>if</b> – any of these changes will be added to the game, as 
		scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to 
		the new quests, dungeons and items that we'll be introducing in each 
		monthly event. Your feedback on these topics is particularly valuable.</font></i></p>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">If not mentioned elsewhere in this 
		Letter, topics listed as <b>In Concept</b> in prior articles have not 
		changed status.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">Chat Windows!</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To make it easier to manage the new 
		Global Chat Channels, along with the many existing forms of chat, we are 
		working on new chat windows. These will be floating, transparent, 
		movable and resizeable windows that can be configured to show any of the 
		existing chat types or channels. This is in addition to the main chat 
		window, which will stay in its current location and gain the ability to 
		have various chat channels and types added to it or removed from it.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Fellowship Improvements!</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are working on major improvements to 
		the way in which information about your Fellowship is displayed. This 
		includes radar improvements to allow you to more easily find members of 
		your Fellowship and a floating window to allow you to more easily track 
		the health and other vitals of your Fellowship members.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">Friends Panel!</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are also developing a new Friends UI 
		panel to allow you to more easily manage your friends list and 
		communicate with the players on said list. This will be in addition to 
		the existing /friends command-line functionality.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, there you have it – our plans for 
		August and beyond. New quests, new content and new features&amp; it's a 
		great time to be playing <i>Asheron's Call</i>!</font></p>
