    As the festival season approaches, some interesting changes are coming to 
	Dereth. The town of Glenden Wood is gearing up for a big celebration this 
	year. They are really in the holiday spirit and there are rumors that one of 
	Dereth's most famous personalities may pay them a visit! The farmers have 
	also been gearing up for the holiday season. While getting their pumpkins 
	ready, there have been some strange reports coming out of the pumpkin 
	patches. It would be great if the people of Dereth can figure out what is 
	going on!<br>
	<br>
	The Town Criers will also be getting into the festival spirit this year. 
	They have been picking out their masks, as well as some costumes. You never 
	know what they might be dressed as when you get into town! Don't forget to 
	chat with them; they are going to have a lot to talk about this season.<br>
	<br>
	There have also been some Viamontian sightings recently. It appears they may 
	be doing some digging. What could they be looking for? What will they find? 
	And does this have anything to do with the season?</p>

	<p>Ulgrim checked the tower room once more. Cold brew still stood on the 
	icebox and a pile of Pyreals and other trinkets sat in the corner. He had 
	enough stout and food to get him to where he was going, but he didn't expect 
	he would need it. Dereth seemed smaller these days. The vast portal network 
	could almost always be used to get within easy walking distance of where you 
	needed to go.<br>
	<br>
	He turned and walked down the ramp to the courtyard, sliding his hands along 
	the stone walls of the keep.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Hey you!&quot; he pointed gleefully to the Merchant. &quot;Don't take any wooden 
	Pyreals!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Watch those late night hunting excursions! Don't forget how we were almost 
	gored by that Mattekar,&quot; he said shaking hands with the Wandering Bowyer. 
	The fact of the matter was he didn't know any of these people's names. He 
	remembered introducing himself on the day he arrived and handing out a 
	friendly round or eight of his personal brew, but in the happy celebration 
	of meeting new friends he had completely forgotten their names. He would be 
	too embarrassed to ask them now.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I'll be in Glenden Wood at the Festival if you need to reach me or just 
	want to come by and raise a toast to the Season.&quot; He called out, waving and 
	grinning like an Eater.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim took one last look around the keep that had been his home for the 
	past few months. Well, duty calls, and what would a Festival be without him?<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Farewell everyone!&quot; He waved once and twisted his wand in the symbolic 
	gesture, mumbling the words he never seemed to forget even after he was deep 
	in his cups. Portal space wrapped around him and the keep receded in a 
	purple blur of tunnel vision. He had a few stops to make before Glenden 
	Wood, and he was looking forward to them.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	The Drunken Madman laughed to himself again. If you couldn't laugh at things 
	then you truly were mad. He snorted at this thought. He wasn't mad, he was 
	free and probably happier than most of the inhabitants of Dereth. He had 
	left his worries behind and now he lived a life free of restrictions. No 
	more of the pain and fear that had plagued him in the early days after 
	arriving here. The horrors he had seen in those first days&amp; well that wasn't 
	his problem anymore! Now it was time for a drink and roll in the mud.<br>
	<br>
	He had just started to get into his mud pool when a familiar robe and mug 
	came out of the woods waving to him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ulgrim! Long time no see old friend, come and join me. I was just about to 
	go for a dip and have a drop of sake.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No thanks Jeremy, I never touch that sake stuff. It gives me nightmares and 
	I don't need more of those. Have you been seen many people lately?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No, no one wants to follow the Path anymore. They all run around with that 
	silly spell now. The one that lets them play at kill each other without 
	consequence. Asheron's protections make us weak and soft. We won't be ready. 
	If I had my way I would show them how to really fight.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;They just need a form of release, you and I should understand that better 
	than most. Besides, they become better fighters in the process and anything 
	that makes us stronger is a good&amp; well they are becoming better fighters, 
	there's that.&quot; Ulgrim shrugged.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yeah, but they don't have to sacrifice anything. They put no weight on 
	their own deaths. How can they become real fighters without sacrifice? Bah! 
	Let them wear pink for all I care. Say, you should hear this joke I just 
	thought up.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim passed the time drinking and joking with the Drunken Madman, watching 
	him play like a child in the mud. Jeremy had been one of the first to arrive 
	on Dereth. Something other than the Olthoi had found him in the first few 
	days, something that had driven him mad. He never talked of it, but he 
	didn't talk to many people anyway. With the exception of Ulgrim and a few 
	powerful fighters, no one even knew his name. If things got really, really 
	bad, he knew that Jeremy would be a powerful ally, if he chose to fight. 
	Hopefully it would never come to that.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, my friend, I have to be going. Could you perhaps summon a portal to 
	my island for me? I've tied somewhere else and I don't relish portal jumping 
	all the way there.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Sure, watch your back out there Ulgrim. Don't let the red eyes get you.&quot; 
	Jeremy drew an arcane symbol in the mud and giggled something beneath his 
	breath.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim waved to Jeremy and stepped through the portal.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim the Unappreciated tilted back the giant mug and finished his lunch. 
	It had been a pretty dull day at the house. No visitors had come by yet, but 
	they usually didn't start pestering him until after lunch anyway. He had 
	read a book he had borrowed from the Library in Rithwic, some story about a 
	little girl and her cow. It was kind of touching, but it was written a 
	little oddly and left him feeling uneasy. Lunch had cleared all that up. Now 
	it was time to do a little gardening. He went to the window and stood on the 
	tips of his toes to see over the windowsill. At least no one had taken any 
	of his lawn ornaments. Some people loved to play tricks on him, thinking it 
	was funny to play with the Little Guy. They often didn't think it was so 
	funny when they were plummeting to their deaths over Fort Tethana!<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What are you looking at? Those statues didn't start walking around again 
	did they?&quot; a familiar voice behind him said.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim turned around and looked up. Standing behind him was himself, only 
	bigger – and, he had to admit, damn handsome.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Big Guy! Where've you been? I thought maybe the Virindi finally got you!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I was visiting some friends in the mountains. You know how it is, I needed 
	to get away for a bit after Jaleh's death. I may not have acted like it, but 
	I respected him. But you know that don't you? Of course you do, you're me 
	after all. And damn handsome if I do say so!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So, Little Guy, you have any of the home brew for your thirsty brother?&quot; 
	The two Ulgrims had given up trying to call each other by their name. It was 
	too confusing and it always sounded odd.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Sure, here you go.&quot; The smaller Ulgrim passed a large mug of homebrew up to 
	him, raising an eyebrow knowingly. &quot;Are you staying the night or are you off 
	to Glenden Wood?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ah, you know me too well. It wouldn't be a party without one of us around 
	would it? Bye the way, I have a challenge for you. I'll bet you I can drink 
	more stouts than you can in one minute.&quot; He looked down expectantly at his 
	smaller brother. There wasn't a chance that a man that size could out drink 
	him.<br>
	<br>
	The smaller Ulgrim considered this for a moment and then to his brother's 
	surprise nodded &quot;Ok, but let's make this interesting: if I win you have to 
	dress up as Elysa, dress and a tiara, no armor.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;All right, you're on little brother. But if I win you have to dress as a 
	Pack Ursuin.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Both Ulgrims grinned and shook hands, sure the other would have to suffer 
	the humiliation of dressing up in a silly costume.<br>
	<br>
	One minute and 56 home brews later they both stood trying to catch their 
	breath.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Admit it! You are beaten! Look you're still holding beer in your mouth!&quot; 
	the smaller of the two pointed.<br>
	<br>
	The larger Ulgrim swallowed and looked offended. &quot;I drank it! Besides, you 
	didn't so much drink your brew as shower in it. Look at your robe!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Now it was the smaller Ulgrim's turn to look offended. &quot;It's not my fault 
	these mugs are so big! Look, let's settle this fairly. Each of us will 
	consolidate our empties and we can see who had the most left.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	After more arguing and careful pouring, each of their mugs stood side by 
	side.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes! I win! Me! Ulgrim the Magnificent! I am a drinking god! It's Festival 
	time my friend, and you are dressing as an Ursuin! Pack Doll that is. You're 
	gonna be so cute!&quot; Ulgrim reached out and ruffled his smaller brother's 
	hair.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ah! Get away from me! The only reason you won is because of these stupid 
	mugs. If we were going by body weight I would have won hands down!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Now, now, I won by the terms of our bet and you know what you have to do.&quot; 
	Ulgrim smiled. &quot;If I had lost you know I would be stuffing my undershirt 
	right now.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	At this they both broke out laughing.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;All right, I'll do it, but next time you're going down!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The smaller Ulgrim passed his brother something wrapped in paper. &quot;Don't 
	open that until you get to Glenden Wood. I want it to be a surprise.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim took the gift and knelt down and gave his brother a huge Ursuin hug.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Let's meet tomorrow night. We can drink some lightweights under the table 
	together,&quot; he laughed. They waved to each other as he recalled to the 
	Abandoned Mine, from where he would hop a portal to Glenden Wood.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim sat down in the Overlook pub and pulled the package from his 
	backpack. He laughed to himself. The present was wrapped in Scrolls of 
	Ketnan's Boon! Funny, very funny. He tore through the wrapping and his eyes 
	lit up. A broad smile stretched across his face as he stared at the present.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It looks like Asheron will be visiting the Glenden Wood Festival this year! 
	Haha!&quot;</p>

	<p>Ardry stepped through the doors of the Four Shields tavern. He dropped 
	his pack and bow wearily on a table, then slouched into a chair. There was 
	one other person in the tavern at the moment, standing by the bar, nursing a 
	goblet of something. He was a Gharu'ndim, dressed all in plain grey, with an 
	eye patch covering his left eye.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Red wine, please, Iquba,&quot; Ardry called to the bartender. She nodded, used 
	to his late-night entrances, and poured out a cup of the house red.<br>
	<br>
	The stranger laid a handful of coins on the bar and took the cup of red wine 
	to Ardry's table. He set the cup in front of the weary scout. &quot;You're Ardry 
	the Dubious, are you not?&quot; the stranger asked.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry took the wine, sniffed it, and took a slow sip as he appraised the 
	stranger. Finally, he gestured to the other empty chair at the table. 
	&quot;That's me. Who are you, and how do you know me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The stranger smiled as he sat. &quot;Forgive me, my name is Qath. Qath al-Haddash. 
	I know of you, because you have acquired a reputation as an intrepid scout. 
	Your uncle Aliester speaks highly of you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry laughed. &quot;Ah, Uncle Aliester. All right then. By the way, you're going 
	to need a better costume than just an eye patch if you want to get into the 
	proper spirit of the festival. I mean, look at the Town Criers out there...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	All the humor dropped out of Qath's face. &quot;This is no costume.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh. Uh, my apologies, then, Qath. Can I ask how you lost your eye?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Icepick. Baionna. Fifteen years ago, in Ispar. Any other questions?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I guess not.&quot; Ardry sipped his wine cautiously. &quot;So what did you want to 
	talk about? This isn't just a social call, is it?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I was hoping to be able to compare notes with you,&quot; said Qath, recovering 
	his coolly pleasant tone. &quot;I am also a scout, and a scholar of sorts. A 
	merchant of information. And I believe we have a mutual interest in tracking 
	Viamontian activity...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry frowned. &quot;You make yourself sound like a spy.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Qath shrugged. &quot;No more a spy than you, I think. I read some of your earlier 
	reports, back in the days of the Virindi Schism... Not to mention your 
	detailed reconnaissance in the matter of Zaikhal, not too long ago.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;All right then, Qath, I'll play along. Let's talk Viamontians.&quot; Suddenly 
	nervous, Ardry looked around the room to see if anyone else could possibly 
	overhear their conversation.<br>
	<br>
	Apparently pleased to get down to business, Qath leaned close and spoke 
	softly. &quot;The invader King has dispatched his dogs throughout the known 
	lands, ransacking tombs, catacombs, long-lost libraries... I have been 
	studying their movements for some time. I think I am close to discovering 
	what they are truly after.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry laughed. &quot;Varicci's looking for something to help him win the war. 
	They don't even know what they're looking for – they're just hoping they'll 
	recognize it when they stumble over it.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Qath shook his head. &quot;The Rouleans underestimated the Viamontians thus. Do 
	not repeat their mistake. Then again, who am I to speak to an Aluvian about 
	underestimating Viamont?&quot; His smile had turned sharp, and there was a gleam 
	of cruel amusement in his eyes.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry gritted his teeth. &quot;All right, fair enough. What do you want from me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I need you to help me, ah, investigate another Viamontian installation. 
	Quickly, before they can make further progress.&quot;<br>

	Ardry gulped down the last of his wine. &quot;All right, this is where we stop 
	talking about this in public.&quot; He stood, shouldered his pack, and picked up 
	his bow. &quot;Let's pay a visit to the local lifestone, and then we can go for a 
	walk to discuss this proposal of yours.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Qath nodded silently, finished his own drink, and stood to leave. Ardry 
	stopped suddenly and turned to Qath. &quot;Just so you know, I don't trust you a 
	bit.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Qath laughed. &quot;I would be disappointed if you did.&quot; They looked each other 
	in the eye for a long moment, then nodded simultaneously and headed for the 
	door.</p>

	<p><b>Hotkey issues: </b>We have discovered the cause for this problem, 
	unfortunately we haven't been able to implement a fix for this issue as of 
	yet. We are still working on this problem. When we have more updates on this 
	we will let you know.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Changes for the Festival season</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fall is here! That means the trees have changed colors and a chill 
		is in the air.</li>
		<li>We have added several new masks and guises for the Festival 
		celebration. You can now have a mask from creatures such as the Penguin 
		or if you want to go with a scarier look, you can wear Fiun mask.</li>
		<li>New treats and a few tricks have been added into the game. You can 
		get items such as candy and goodies, or you can also get a shirt to 
		celebrate the occasion!</li>
		<li>Ulgrim is on the move again. It is one of Ulgrim's favorite times of 
		the year. Everyone knows that Ulgrim doesn't miss a party!</li>
		<li>New holiday themed rewards for live events have been added to the 
		game. You never know what you might get when you participate this month.</li>
		<li>Farmers have been complaining about some strange creatures in their 
		Pumpkin patches. Not to mention the strange bodies that have been 
		appearing as well. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>General fixes and changes </b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Olthoi in the Egg Orchard have had their damage returned to normal. 
		They had been hitting for more than they were supposed to.</li>
		<li>We have lowered the availability of the gold creatures on the 
		Vissidal Island. The gold creatures were too prevalent in September. 
		They were producing a higher XP yield than was intended. </li>
		<li>The Vissidal trees that were spawning on the landscape all over 
		Dereth have been returned to their rightful place on the island. They 
		should no longer be growing all over Dereth.</li>
		<li>Sir Bellas from the Augmentation quest had a weapon that when Blood 
		Loather was used on it made him hit for very little or no damage. This 
		has been fixed for October.</li>
		<li>Several crevices in the landscape have been fixed. Players will not 
		longer get stuck in these places.</li>
		<li>The floating items in Al-Jalima and Khayyaban have finally 
		discovered gravity again.</li>
		<li>Some spawns that were near player housing and Lifestones have been 
		moved to different areas of the landscape. If you are still seeing 
		creatures appearing near your housing or too close to a Lifestone, 
		please let us know by using our QA site.</li>
		<li>New live events dungeons have been added to the game. These should 
		help in making events more interesting and exciting!</li>
		<li>We have started updating older quests again. So make sure you check 
		out some of your old favorites. You never know which quests may have 
		been changed. </li>

    <p><span lang="en-us">Welcome to the October Letter to the Players!<br>
    <br>
    Over the last month in Dereth the Viamontian's have been on the move. Having 
    already taken over several towns on the Island of Marae Lassel, what will be 
    the next move that King Varicci II has in mind? <br>
    <br>
    <b>Changes to the Team</b><br>
    For those that missed the announcement on our forums our own Jonathan &quot;Calandryll&quot; 
    Hanna has decided to stay on as the Producer for Asheron's Call. We are all 
    happy to see that he has done this, and we are looking forward to what he 
    brings to the team. We also brought an AC1 Alumni back to the team. Speed, 
    who had been working in our QA department came back to us and jumped right 
    into the fray, creating some very cool content for this update. <br>
    <br>
    Let's get right to what is happening this month in Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    <b>New for October</b><br>
    It is the time of year again when the leaves begin to change and chill is in 
    the air. This of course means it is Festival time! As one of our favorite 
    times of year the Festival event represents a time of celebration in Dereth. 
    This year we decided to concentrate on getting some really new and exciting 
    things for the players to do and wear. And don't forget that the Scarecrows 
    will be returning to the landscape. <br>
    <br>
    The team has worked incredibly hard on getting some new masks and guises 
    together for this year, and I think everyone will really enjoy them, once 
    they have been found. <br>
    <br>
    Town criers will also be getting some love this month. In previous years 
    they would traditionally wear masks during the festival season. This year 
    they have decided to take it one step further. They will be in full costume! 
    You may notice some strange costume combinations, but that's ok, the Town 
    Criers decided to be a little different this year and mixed up things a bit. 
    Make sure you check them out. <br>
    <br>
    Everybody's favorite drunk is on the move again. Where has Ulgrim gone to 
    this time? And what does he have to say about his travels? <br>
    <br>
    There have also been some new treats and goodies added to the game. Some 
    will be found, some will be given, and yet some others will be earned. It is 
    the festival event, so what better way to celebrate than with tricks and 
    treats?<br>
    <br>
    For those of you who like to participate in our many live events we have 
    been running, there will be some special rewards given out. I won't give it 
    away here, but lets just say that you might want to make sure you have some 
    space in your packs for some new friends. <br>
    <br>
    On the subject of live events, we have gotten a lot of great feedback on 
    these events. One piece of feedback we have gotten was that these events are 
    always in a town where players might not want to participate. With that and 
    a few other reasons in mind, we have created some new dungeons which we will 
    be using for the sole purpose of running live events. We feel this will add 
    a new dynamic to these events and also give us the ability to do some more 
    interesting events. This does not mean that we will be stopping the live 
    events in the towns, but it does give us a lot more options. <br>
    <br>
    Now you know what to expect this month in Dereth. I know that in past months 
    we would add the in concept section on this part of the letter but at this 
    point things are just getting back to normal from the move from LA. The In 
    Concept section will be returning for next month. <br>
    <br>
    So that's about it for now. We have some really neat things in store for 
    you, but we aren't going to give you any more hints. You will just have to 
    log in and see for yourself!<br>
    <br>
    Dereth is full of Wonders!<br>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="timer"></a>Respec Timer Redesign </b>- <font face="Arial" size="1">from the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=422">Turbine Site</a>, 
	November 11, 2005</font></span></p>
	<p>Asheron's Call has gone through several phases of history in its long 
	lifespan. At times, various different templates have been favored either by 
	design or unintentionally. It was for this reason that the Temples of 
	Enlightenment and Forgetfulness were initially introduced - to allow players 
	to change their character into a more enjoyable template.<br>
	<br>
	However, various unintended and less desirable consequences arose from this 
	decision. First with Gromnie Teeth, and then with Tesserae, people would 
	utilize the ability to untrain and retain skills as a means to fast 
	experience. Very little respect for the original template choices a player 
	might make remained.<br>
	<br>
	The intention of our changes to the Temples are to hopefully satisfy the 
	former crowd - those who have templates which are just no fun - while at the 
	same time hindering the latter crowd - those who utilize retraining as an 
	experience point system or who retrain lockpick every other week in order to 
	benefit from that content which was developed for dedicated lockpickers in 
	mind. We want templates to matter, but we don't want them to be a death 
	sentence should you have chosen poorly and realized your mistake at level 
	40.<br>
	<br>
	Therefore, we will be introducing a scaling timer on all skill and attribute 
	gems. At first, you can get your gems instantaneously, but the timer will 
	increase the more gems of a certain type you get. In order to acquire the 
	gems, you will need to hand a token (which will generate on a 1 minute timer 
	in the Temples) to a statue. The statue will analyze how many times you have 
	received a gem of that type, and if the appropriate amount of time has 
	expired, it will give you a gem. Otherwise, it asks you to come back later, 
	and specifies the total amount of time you must wait. There will be books in 
	the Temples explaining the new timers as well.<br>
	<br>
	The timers will be set as follows<br>
	<br>
	Untrain<br>
	1st-4th gems: Instant<br>
	5th-8th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	9th-12th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	13th and above: 4 week timer<br>
	<br>
	Specialization<br>
	1st-2nd gems: Instant<br>
	3rd-4th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	5th-6th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	7th and above: 4 week timer<br>
	<br>
	Attribute<br>
	1st-18th: Instant<br>
	19th-36th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	37th and above: 4 week timer<br>
	<br>
	To accompany these changes, we have also found it necessary to amend the way 
	Tesserae work slightly. If you receive an untrain skill gem, you will be 
	barred from handing in a Tessera of that skill for 3 months. Also, there 
	will now be a 2 week hand-in timer on Tesserae in general, to prevent people 
	from picking up all their gems at once, waiting for the timer to expire, and 
	then alternating between turning in Tesserae and untraining the skill.<br>
	<br>
	We hope that these changes will add to the game, and we welcome any feedback 
	that you, the players, have on this issue - it is, obviously, a very touchy 
	issue, and we are open to the concept of tweaking this idea in response to 
	feedback from the players. Still, we believe that in this system we have 
	achieved a balance between what the two opposing camps of player thought 
	desire on this issue.</p>
