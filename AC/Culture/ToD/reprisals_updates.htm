	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope we are all doing well this week. Let’s get 
	right into what is going on. <br>
	<br>
	As you all know by now, we banned a number of accounts for the duping of 
	items on the Darktide server. While I won’t go into the process behind how 
	we tracked these players, we are confident that we are moving in the right 
	direction when it comes to players who want to cheat or exploit to get 
	ahead. We will be continuing to track and ban any players who intentionally 
	try to exploit or cheat in Asheron’s Call.<br>
	<br>
	We have been given the ok to begin distributing Asheron’s Call: Throne of 
	Destiny CD Keys online. Our web folks are working on getting everything set 
	up and we hope to have an actual date for this to begin very soon. This 
	means you will not only be able to buy your ToD key online, but you will 
	also be able to download the full updated game right from our site.<br>
	<br>
	The February event is looking good so far. Not only will this month have 
	some great new features in it, some of the content should be exactly what a 
	lot of people have been asking for, including but not limited to quests that 
	have you making a choice in the conflict between King Varicci and Queen 
	Elysa. While I will not get into the details, this is looking like a very 
	exciting month for AC fans. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on the final stages of design and 
	implementation for February. This is when we really start digging into the 
	new content, looking for bugs and any errors that may have made it into the 
	game. <br>
	<br>
	That is about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you in Dereth!<br>

    <p><b>PvP plans for February event and the future </b>-<b> 1/26/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=265244#post265244">by 
	Crowley</a>)</p>
	<p>Hey everyone,<br>
	<br>
	I just wanted to give our dedicated PvP players a heads-up on the changes 
	we’ve planned for February to start to address PvP balance issues.<br>
	<br>
	Based on what we've seen on the boards, there are a few balance issues with 
	PvP combat, which I spelled out in my earlier &quot;Looking for PvP Feedback&quot; 
	post. The first issue we plan to address is the difficulty that melees have 
	a difficult time hitting mages with Melee D tinked wands. This does not mean 
	that it's the most important issue, but it was the issue we were most 
	readily able to work on.<br>
	<br>
	What we're planning to do for February is to introduce a quest that allows 
	PK players only (not NPKs or PKLs) to acquire an object that provides a 
	temporary 10% increase to their weapon's Attack Mod. This increase will be 
	stackable with Heartseeker and existing Attack Mod cantrips. This is similar 
	in mechanics to the way the Rage of Grael gems worked -- you will be able to 
	temporarily boost your chances to hit an opponent in melee combat. The 
	dungeon where you can acquire these items will have multiple entry points 
	and multiple spots to collect the items, to help alleviate camping concerns. 
	The items will be on a timer, so you won't be able to stockpile huge amounts 
	quickly. This new enchantment will not be usable on Weeping Weapons, for 
	reasons explained below.<br>
	<br>
	Please keep in mind that this is simply the first and simplest step we could 
	take towards addressing your balance concerns. This is by no means the end 
	of our plans to help PvP players. We still intend to take more steps to make 
	fights shorter and more exciting and to make melee players more competitive. 
	Our current plans are to find ways to make loot weapons viable in PvP 
	combat, rather than tweaking the balance on Weeping Weapons. Addressing loot 
	weapons seems like a richer and more complete fix than fixing one class of 
	weapons. I won't go into specifics on our solutions to those issues, but you 
	can expect to see some more specific information on those ideas in the 
	coming weeks. We will most definitely address damage balance with whatever 
	fix we do. I know a lot of people would prefer that we work on damage first, 
	but again, a properly constructed balance solution is more complex than this 
	relatively simple Attack Mod bonus.<br>
	<br>
	We also know that PvP players want something to fight over. There are a few 
	ideas on the board for that, as well, but our primary concern is to address 
	balance. This doesn’t mean that we’re not going to touch the &quot;what to fight 
	over&quot; issue until after we've worked on balance – but I wanted to give you 
	some idea of where our priorities lie.<br>
	<br>
	Please let us know what you think, and you can rest assured that we'll keep 
	coming back here for consultation, especially on the more complex balance 
	issues.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks,<br>
	<br>

    <p><b>Detailed Combat Feedback </b>-<b> 1/26/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=265568#post265568">by 
	Crowley</a>)</p>
	<p>Hey all,<br>
	<br>
	You've given us a lot of really good feedback over the past couple of weeks 
	-- and before that too, of course, but the targeted feedback of the past few 
	weeks has been incredibly helpful to us. Now we want to turn around and ask 
	all of you some pointed questions to make sure we understand, and also to 
	see how you might feel about some solutions. <br>
	<br>
	I know we've talked about some of these things before in other threads. But 
	we want to make sure we get this right. Anyway, sometimes asking about the 
	same things in different ways helps open up new ideas for solutions. <br>
	<br>
	We can break up most of the feedback about PK in general into two 
	categories:<br>
	<br>
	* PvP combat is too tedious and slow, and<br>
	<br>
	* PvP players need better reasons to fight and something to fight over. <br>
	<br>
	This thread is going to concentrate on the first point. The second point is 
	also important, and we'll be asking for directed feedback on that a bit 
	later. But this thread is all about improving the feel of PvP combat.<br>
	<br>
	In order to help organize things, I'm going to number the statements or 
	questions we're seeking feedback on with the label {FP#} (for Feedback 
	Point). That way you can refer to specific points better. Of course, any and 
	all feedback you give us is really helpful, so feel free to talk about more 
	than just things mentioned here. Please do keep this thread to combat 
	feedback, though. <br>
	<br>
	The underlying problem that we're looking at in this thread is: PvP fights 
	take too long. There are many reasons for this. <br>
	<br>
	{FP#1} Did we miss anything major in the following list?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>YOU CAN'T LAND ENOUGH HITS ON YOUR OPPONENT</b><br>
	<br>
	* Non-melee hits can be physically dodged. <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#2} Because of various animation issues with spell-casting, this 
	seems to be mostly a problem for missile combat. Is magic combat okay in 
	this area until and unless the animation issues are fixed?<br>
	<br>
	* Once you physically connect, the combat system tests attack skill vs. 
	defense skill. It's too easy for your opponent to have a very high defense 
	skill and thus avoid getting hit. This is especially an issue when attacking 
	a mage with a meleeD tinkered wand. <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#3} Is it a more general problem when attacking melee and missile 
	opponents? <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#4} Do skill buffs, imbued armor, or rare gems make this problem 
	much worse, or would those things be okay if we solved the meleeD wand 
	issue? <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#5} Is there also a problem with missile defense?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>WHEN YOU LAND HITS, YOU DON'T DO ENOUGH DAMAGE TO MAKE AN IMPACT</b><br>
	<br>
	* Players have an awful lot of health these days, so normal damage often 
	doesn't make much of an impact.<br>
	<br>
	* Players are usually protected by a high level of armor, which reduces 
	non-magic damage considerably. <br>
	<br>
	* Players are often protected by a high level of protection spells and 
	wards, which reduces all damage considerably. <br>
	<br>
	* Melee and missile weapons do relatively small amounts of damage per hit 
	compared to magic. In order to make a real impact on your opponent with 
	melee or missile weapons, you have to rely on critical hits.<br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#6} Do mages also need to rely on crits? <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>WHEN YOU DO DAMAGE, IT'S TOO EASY FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO HEAL THAT DAMAGE</b><br>
	<br>
	* Players can heal much of their damage very quickly with spells, potions, 
	or kits. <br>
	<br>
	Now, assuming that we haven't missed anything too major, let's look at some 
	potential solutions. Keep in mind that nothing here constitutes a promise or 
	plan of action yet. And while we'll only mention things that we think we can 
	do, there may be unforeseen problems that end up ruling out some of these 
	ideas. Finally, if one of these ideas looks like a winner, we may still need 
	to work out a lot of details: How does it affect PKL and/or NPK? How do you 
	get the effect – is it global or do you do a quest or get an imbue or what?<br>
	<br>
	Also note that many of these ideas came directly from your previous 
	feedback, so a lot of this should look familiar. :&gt;<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>YOU CAN'T LAND ENOUGH HITS ON YOUR OPPONENT</b><br>
	<br>
	* For missile weapons in particular: The PvP-oriented missile weapons had 
	their maximum missile velocity increased up some time ago. In other words, 
	they fire faster arrows. We can speed up other missile weapons – namely loot 
	weapons – by the same amount. Unfortunately, because of the physics of the 
	AC1 world it's going to be very difficult to speed up missile velocity any 
	more than this. We've been playing with it internally: when you speed up the 
	launchers more, you suddenly can't hit anything at all. <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#7} Did this help? Did it help enough? Is it worthwhile adding a way 
	to speed up missiles fired from loot bows?<br>
	<br>
	* Also for missile weapons: {FP#8} We may be able to play around with the 
	radius of the hit area. In other words, instead of the attack hitting if the 
	arrow hits your target directly, the attack would hit if the arrow came 
	within 3 feet of your target. <br>
	<br>
	* And finally for missile weapons: {FP#9} We may be able to let you turn on 
	and off the behavior that causes missile weapons to try to 'lead' their 
	target during combat.<br>
	<br>
	* We could add ways to increase attack skill without increasing defense 
	skill. The attack mod spell we've been talking about in February is an 
	example of this. Other examples:<br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#10} We could add Level 8 Heartseeker but not Level 8 Defender. <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#11} We could cause attack mods to be twice as effective when used 
	against another player.<br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#12} We could add an effect – like an imbue or the Aegis effect – 
	that increases the attack mod of a weapon vs. other players by a large 
	amount. This amount could be fixed or could vary based on a skill. <br>
	<br>
	* Alternatively, we could reduce defense mods:<br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#13} We could just say that all defense mods on weapons are only 1/4 
	as effective when used against another player. <br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#14} We could add an effect – like an imbue or the Aegis effect – 
	that decreases the defense mod of your opponent's weapon by a large amount. 
	This amount could be fixed or could vary based on a skill.<br>
	<br>
	---- {FP#15} Our general feeling is that increasing attack powers is better 
	than nerfing defense. But what do you think?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>WHEN YOU LAND HITS, YOU DON'T DO ENOUGH DAMAGE TO MAKE AN IMPACT</b><br>
	<br>
	* {FP#16} We'd really rather not directly decrease the health of players. We 
	think that increasing damage is probably better than a direct nerf to 
	health. What do you think?<br>
	<br>
	* {FP#17} We could decrease the effectiveness of armor and/or protections 
	(life spells and wards) across the board in PvP combat. For instance, we 
	could say that in PvP combat, all armor is automatically reduced by 1/2. 
	This could affect real armor, or only AL-raising spells, or both. (It could 
	not affect just tinkers, though. We don't track what AL comes from tinkers 
	and what was there to begin with.) Similarly with protections and wards. <br>
	<br>
	* {FP#18} Alternatively, we could cap the effect of armor and/or 
	protections. For instance, we could say that in PvP combat, armor will only 
	ever reduce damage by 90%, no matter how much armor you have. Similarly, we 
	could cap protections at a 90% reduction. Other numbers might be more 
	appropriate here, of course – I pulled those out of thin air. <br>
	<br>
	* {FP#19} Or we could improve armor rending and resistance rending effects 
	for PvP combat only in order to better cut through armor and protections. 
	For instance, AR currently maxes out ignoring 60% of armor. Perhaps for PvP 
	combat that could become 90% of armor. <br>
	<br>
	* {FP#20} Because PvP combat often relies on critical hits, we could 
	increase the base crit rate for all weapons when used against another 
	player. Or we could increase the effectiveness of Critical Strike and/or 
	Crippling Blow in PvP combat only. <br>
	<br>
	* {FP#21} We could simply raise the damage on weapons in PvP combat. We 
	could do this through a human slayer effect or other special PK-only damage 
	bonuses for loot weapons, or by raising the damage on PvP-oriented weapons.
	<br>
	<br>
	* {FP#22} We could add new &quot;PvP cocktail&quot; effects that give loot weapons a 
	mix of useful PK qualities. For instance, imagine an effect that makes a 
	loot weapon: shield hollow, ignore 25% of other amor, critical 25% of the 
	time, and do an extra 50% damage against other players. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>WHEN YOU DO DAMAGE, IT’S TOO EASY FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO HEAL THAT DAMAGE</b><br>
	<br>
	* {FP#23} We could cause all healing methods to be less effective when 
	involved in PvP combat. Or we could put PK timers on all healing methods. My 
	feeling, however, is that increasing damage is better than nerfing all 
	healing methods. What do you think?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Okay... that should be enough feedback to keep us busy for a few days. :&gt; 
	Let's get to it!<br>

	<p>There is some great feedback in this thread! Thanks, everyone!<br>
	<br>
	Let me answer some questions that you all came up with, and ask some more of 
	my own. I'm going to take the feedback more or less in point order.</p>
	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
	<p>It depends on which war magic projectile you are comparing to. After 
	playing with it internally, I'd suggest a missile hit radius of about 3 
	feet, which is a bit larger than most war magic projectiles. For an arrow, 
	it sounds big and unrealistic, but in fact it seems to play out pretty well. 
	Of course, we'd want you guys to tell us how well it actually worked in the 
	field. <br>
	<br>
	Also on hit radius: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Quote:<br>
		<i>Originally Posted by Paraduck<br>

	</blockquote>
	<p>It wouldn't have to, but it would be a good bit easier if it did. The 
	effect is fairly subtle in PvE, so I'm not much concerned about imbalances 
	there. </p>
	<blockquote>

		<br>
		This would be interesting. It would allow for different pathing options, 
		similar to bolts/arcs. Could this be set as a hotkey so it can be used 
		in combat?</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Actually, yes. I think that is one of the strength's of this change. It 
	could be a character option for all players, so you could map the option to 
	a key and use the key during combat to switch from leading to non-leading in 
	the same way that mages switch between bolts and arcs at will. <br>
	<br>
	Incidentally, I think this might be a good approach for faster missile 
	velocity also. Allow all characters the option to fire normal, more arcing 
	arrows from any bow, or the option to switch the faster, flatter missiles. 
	And again, this could be done during combat with a key press. <br>
	<br>
	The next question I have: would an option for faster missiles and an option 
	for different leading behavior that could both be toggled independently in 
	combat make missiles too hard to dodge?</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>I'm not sure I understand the aim of the question. Are you saying that 
	Level 8 Heartseeker wouldn't be much good if the Level 8 Turn Blade also 
	existed? <br>
	<br>
	Also on Heartseeker 8:</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Yes, I know. :&gt; If this idea went anywhere we'd have to flesh it out, and 
	that includes something for the missile users. At this point, this was just 
	an example. <br>
	<br>
	For the record, I'm not really fond of this idea myself. For one thing, it 
	increases the melee's reliance on magic.</p>
	<blockquote>

		<br>
		Why not just add an effective cap?</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>That's another option. We could either cap defemse mods directly, at say 
	20% or what have you, or cap effective defense skill at 600 or 800 or 
	something. (Again, I am pulling these numbers out of thin air at this 
	point.) But as I mention about armor caps below, I think this may be too 
	heavy-handed, especially if we can come up with an easier, more flexible 
	solution. </p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>That's a good point. I've been assuming that most people have whatever 
	wards they can find, and I've been told that finding wards is no longer the 
	huge problem it once was. So you can tell me how accurate that assumption 
	is: Are most people pretty well-warded out these days? Or would something 
	like this cause a big problem as it forced more people into a mode they'd 
	rather avoid?</p>

		minors? sevens and majors? aegis?</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Hmmm. I was thinking more in terms of, say, a cap of 1250 on effective 
	armor. How you get to that cap -- base AL, tinkering, armor 7, banes, 
	cantrips, etc. -- is your choice, but any effective AL over 1250 is wasted. 
	That's actually about a 95% reduction in damage due to armor, by the way. 
	The more I think about this idea, though, the less I like it. It's pretty 
	heavy-handed, and it would actually be a lot easier to, say, ramp up the 
	effects of AR weapons for PvP combat only.<br>
	<br>
	On that topic:</p>

	<p>We have the ability to increase the effectiveness of AR only when used 
	against another player. We could also allow any PK wielding an AR to get 
	that extra benefit against creatures, buit I'd be worried about two things: 
	1) People going PKL just to get the benefit (which we could avoid, but it 
	would be odd), and 2) NPK players feeling that they *must* go red to get the 
	benefit. Overall, I think it would be safer to limit the extra benefit to 
	PvP combat only. </p>

	<p>How about in increase in Resistance Rending effects when used against

	higher -- when used against another player.</p>

	<p>We have some ideas for at least a couple. Let's talk about this more when

	</blockquote>
	<p>It's funny you should mention this. I was thinking about the same thing 
	yesterday: some sort of quest to render a loot weapon unenchantable. I 
	wasn't sure how useful it would be to the PvP community, though. The spells 
	on the weapon itself would still work, and since you can find loot with 
	level 7s now it might actually be viable. I just wasn't sure how popular it 
	would be. What do you guys think?</p>

	<p>Thank you. Madgic. I was wondering if this discussion applied to PKL any 
	differently than to PK. Our main focus right now is to improve PK in 
	particular, but I think that most of the changes will actually help both.
	<br>
	<br>
	Now, a number of people mentioned that they couldn't judge some of these 
	ideas well until they knew what was happening with loot weapons. So I want 
	to talk about that in more depth next. That's going to be a separate post, 
	though, since these posts are getting a bit long to read. I should have that 
	up in the next day or two.<br>

    <p><b>Re: Detailed Combat Feedback </b>-<b> 1/30/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showpost.php?p=266114&amp;postcount=60">by 
	Crowley</a>)</p>
	<p>So before I solicit more feedback, I'd just like to tell everyone that, 
	while I am the one posting these solicitations for feedback, the PvP 
	research and work that we're doing is a whole team effort. I am not 
	single-handedly steering this effort. I have taken the role of the board 
	poster guy because we've found that a single poster helps to organize our 
	efforts on this very large and complex task. Just look at me as the Voice of 
	Sauron (for those of you who've seen the Extended Edition of RotK) .
	<img class="inlineimg" title="wink" alt="" src="reprisals/wink.gif.html" border="0"><br>
	<br>
	So with that said, let's talk about loot weapons!<br>
	<br>
	Our goal with this is to open up new choices for PvP combat by making loot 
	weapons as attractive as PvP-oriented quest weapons against other players.<br>
	<br>
	{FP#24} In general, we'd like to meet this goal without adding too many new 
	imbues that use the &quot;gather lots of salvage and then take your (at best) 1 
	in 3 chances&quot; mechanic. Instead, we'd rather use less tedious mechanics like 
	quests and simple interactions. The feeling we get is that you guys would 
	rather be out fighting than gathering salvage. Is that a good assumption?
	<br>
	<br>
	I should also mention this: the numbers in this post I am not pulling out of 
	thin air. These numbers are based on comparing weapons -- especially in 
	terms of critical hits -- on our internal charts. Now, charts will get us in 
	the ballpark, but charts are never as good as seeing these changes in play. 
	If we go with any of the changes mentioned here We'll probably end up 
	tweaking these values after you guys have had a chance to play with them and 
	give feedback. We're also probably going to give the quest weapons 
	themselves a small damage boost -- say, 10% -- so keep that in mind as well.
	<br>
	<br>
	Okay! Let's start off by taking a look at some of the special qualities that 
	make quest weapons effective in PvP, qualities that can't be found on loot 
	weapons right now. <br>
	<br>
	Weeping Weapons:<br>
	<br>
	- Unenchantable<br>
	- Shield Hollow<br>
	- Human Slayer<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Phantom Weapons:<br>
	<br>
	- Unenchantable<br>
	- Ignores armor<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Hollow Weapons:<br>
	<br>
	- Unenchantable<br>
	- Life Hollow<br>
	- Item Hollow<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	In addition, there are some qualities that can already be put on loot 
	weapons that aren't really useful right now, but might be if they were 
	stronger:<br>
	<br>
	- Armor Rending<br>
	- Resistance Rending<br>
	- Critical Strike/Crippling Blow<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	So what can we pull out of this? <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#25} The quest weapons are all unenchantable. Would it be useful to add a 
	way to make a loot weapons unenchantable? This has come up in this thread 
	already. Think of this as a repeatable quest you can do to make a weapon 
	unenchantable -- like the Dark Idol quest for bows, not like an imbue or a 
	tinker. The weapon would still get the benefit of any spells that were put 
	on it by the treasure generator, but it couldn't be buffed or debuffed by 
	any player, gems, etc. Would there need to be a drawback, like a penalty to 
	the defense modifier or some other stat, or would being unbuffable be 
	drawback enough?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#26} Weeping and Phantom weapons both ignore shields. This is convenient 
	from a balancing viewpoint because it's otherwise pretty difficult to 
	balance a weapon for use against both melees and archers/mages. So perhaps 
	adding a way to make a loot weapon shield hollow when used in PvP combat 
	might also be very useful. What do you think? Maybe a repeatable quest that 
	renders a weapon shield hollow but also reduces all of it's defense 
	modifiers by some amount. Would that be a useful tradeoff, or would that be 
	too much? <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#27} Phantom weapons, AR weapons, and to some extent Hollow weapons 
	ignore some or all of the target's armor. This is useful since player armor 
	is pretty high these days. Loot weapons already have an option to ignore 
	some armor through the AR imbue, but it just isn't good enough for PvP. How 
	about if we boost the maximum effect of AR for PvP combat only, so that when 
	you attack another player, your AR effect can ignore up to 70-75% of your 
	target's armor (instead of 60% as it is now)? An extra 10-15% AR doesn't 
	look like much, but it would raise the crit damage of an imbued AR weapon 
	about 10-20% above current Weeping weapon damage. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#28} Alternatively, we could add a new effect that did the same thing, 
	but didn't require the salvaging and imbuing process. Consider a repeatable 
	quest that let you make a weapon &quot;PK AR&quot;. This would count as an imbue (so 
	you can't have a CS/PKAR weapon) but wouldn't use salvage and wouldn't have 
	any chance of failure. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You might ask, why not just give all existing loot weapons a small human 
	slayer mod, or add a small AR effect when used in PvP combat? (In fact, I 
	think ChildoftheKoRn asked about the AR in this very thread.) The problem is 
	strictly one of balancing: we need to be able to control exactly how much 
	slayer mode or AR each kind of weapon got, or some would end up way, way 
	better than others. That means figuring out how much AR a CS sword gets vs. 
	a CS dagger vs. an RR bow vs. a ... It's much easier to balance these things 
	if we are only dealing with one variable -- that is, just AR weapons or just 
	PKAR weapons -- and not throwing the other imbues into the mix. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#29} Here's a general question for you: Is improving existing imbues so 
	that they are useful in PvP a good route to take? Or would it be better to 
	add a new effect that did the same thing for PvP only, but could be gotten 
	through a quest instead of through the process of salvaging and imbuing? <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	We could go into details about ways to make RR and CS strong enough to be 
	useful as well, but for now let's just sum up the basic ideas. Our thoughts 
	right now for loot involve the following:<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#30} Adding a couple of effects that can be applied to any loot weapon, 
	like the ones we mention above:<br>
	<br>
	- making the weapon unenchantable<br>
	- making the weapon shield hollow<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Are there any other cool effects that would fit well in this category?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#31} Plus intensifying some imbue-like effects -- either making the 
	existing imbues better for PvP, or providing effects that take the place of 
	an imbue but don't require the whole salvage and imbue thing. Effects like:<br>
	<br>
	- ignore a lot of armor (like 75% AR)<br>
	- cut through a lot of resistances (like level 8 or 9 RR)<br>
	- crit way more often or for more (like 75% CS)<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#32} Plus, maybe one new imbue-like effect -- again probably done through 
	a quest, but which didn't allow further imbues on top of it:<br>
	<br>
	- add a human slayer property<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#33} If we did all of these things, do you think it would improve PvP 
	combat? Or are we trying to do too much too fast? Or are we just way off 
	base?<br>
	<br>
	...<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	{FP#34} Incidentally, does anyone use CB weapons in PvP right now? They 
	don't critical any less frequently than a Weeping weapon, and with the big 
	critical damage I'd think they'd be pretty good. But you, the players, are 
	the experts -- you tell us!<br>

    <p><b>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 1/30/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?t=27961">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope we all had a great weekend of playing 
	Asheron's Call, I know I did. Let’s get right into this weeks update. <br>
	<br>
	This is the week in the development process that we use for final 
	implementation and testing of the upcoming event. This is when we go through 
	all the new content and features to make sure everything is working the way 
	we want it to. We then fix anything that might not be right and adjust 
	anything that might need to be changed up based on testing. <br>
	<br>
	One thing we are really excited about that is going into the February event 
	is a new Title Management Tab. This tab will allow players to choose from 
	any title they have earned after the February event, as the title they want 
	displayed to others. If on any given day you want to display your 
	Queenslayer title, you can. If later that day, you decide you want to 
	display your Paragon of Death title, you can. At any time you will be able 
	to change your display title to any one of the titles your character has 
	earned in Dereth. <br>
	<br>
	This is just one of the new things going into the February event <i><b>A 
	Change in Tactics</b></i>. The various fansites have also received the 
	monthly teaser images a bit early this month, so make sure to check them all 
	out. We will be posting a few of our own as we get closer to the event, 
	which is tentatively scheduled for February 15th. The date is as always 
	subject to change is something major comes up. <br>
	<br>
	Last but certainly not least we want to express our thanks to the PvP 
	community for their continued feedback on our
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?t=27924">
	Detailed Combat Feedback</a> thread. The more information we can gather on 
	these issues which are most important to you, the better. Please, feel free 
	to continue to give us your feedback on things that matter most to you. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great day. See you in Dereth!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Edit:</b> Due to an error on my part I need to clarify some information 
	about the Title Management Panel. When you log in for the first time after 
	the February event goes live, you will have the title your character 
	currently has in the Title Management Panel. Any other titles that you would 
	like to add to that panel, must be added after the February event has gone 
	live. As much as we would have liked to, we have no way of tracking what 
	titles you have had in the past. We wish we could have done this, but 
	unfortunately it was not ppossible.<br>

	<p>First, to answer a couple of specific comments:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i>Quote:<br>
		Originally Posted by Angier<br>
		People don't use CB because despite a heavy reliance on crits, it does 
		take normal hits as well to win a fight.</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Thanks, Angier. We knew we were missing part of the equation there.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i>Quote:<br>
		Originally Posted by Heideggar<br>
		Crowley, you talked about speed of projectiles getting to point where, 
		when increased beyond a certain speed, they don't hit much. Is this 
		still true when hit radius is increased?</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Yes. Increasing missile velocity beyond a certain point causes the 
	missiles to nosedive into the dirt a few feet from the archer. Presumably 
	this is some weird side effect of the physics code, but after setting an 
	engineer on it for several hours to no good effect, we're just not willing 
	to spend more time there for an uncertain benefit. <br>
	<br>
	...<br>
	<br>
	Now, let's talk big picture. A number of you guys have cautioned us not to 
	bite off more than we can chew, or alternatively just to get the simple 
	fixes in and working and fiddle with the complicated new ideas later. And 
	honestly, we think you're right. The more the team talks about this, the 
	more we agree that getting the simpler, less risky stuff out the door first 
	is a good approach here. Now there's some great stuff in this thread that we 
	will continue talking about, but this way we can also start thinking about 
	the 'something to fight over' question in more detail. <br>
	<br>
	So here's the rough plan for improving PvP combat in March. <b>Please 
	understand that this can still change -- nothing here should be interpreted 
	as a promise.</b><br>
	<br>
	1) We add options for missile combat to make it slightly harder to dodge 
	arrows: the option to turn on/off faster projectiles and the option to turn 
	on/off 'leading' the target. We drop the larger strike radius idea until we 
	see how everything else plays out, because of the three that is potentially 
	the most unbalancing. <br>
	<br>
	2) We improve the damage on existing PvP-oriented weapons a bit, including 
	Weepings, Phantoms, and Deadly Hollows. This way, even if we utterly fail 
	with loot weapons, we've still done something concrete to help PvP fights 
	not drag on so long. <br>
	<br>
	3) We improve existing imbued loot weapons when they are used in PvP. And 
	yes, we intend these to be a bit better than the quest weapons in order to 
	justify the extra effort of finding the right weapon, gathering salvage, 
	imbuing, etc. By improving existing imbues, you can hopefully use the same 
	weapons to hunt and PK with -- which avoids having a lot of new weapons to 
	lug around. I don't know if we'll be able to make all the imbues PvP-worthy 
	on the first go-round -- we are still working with the numbers -- but once 
	we get the numbers pegged down this is actually a pretty simple change. <br>
	<br>
	As I said, there's been a lot of really great ideas in this thread beyond 
	these few simple things, and we're not going to forget those. These three 
	things together are not going to &quot;fix&quot; PvP. But I think it is important to 
	start with something manageable and concrete, and go from there. And with 
	your copious help, I think we're making a good start.<br>

	<p>We are keeping an eye on critical damage as well. Increasing the damage 
	on these weapons also increases the damage on the critical hits pretty well, 
	so we don't want to bump the crit rate until we see what effect that has.

	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope we all had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	This week in Asheron’s Call we are busy getting the February event ready to 
	go. That means fixing any issues that may pop up while we are testing things 
	out. In case you missed this information in the last update, the February 
	event, <i>A Change in Tactics</i>, is scheduled to go live on February 15th. 
	We are also working on things for the March event. Getting the writing done, 
	as well as checking the mechanics of the things we want to do. <br>
	<br>
	I would like to also take this opportunity to announce that on February 
	15th, we will also be making the upgrade to the Darktide Hardware. We 
	figured since the worlds were going to be down anyway, that this would be 
	the best time to do this rather than having to bring Darktide down on 
	another day. When this process is being worked on Darktide will have a bit 
	of extra downtime so that we can make sure everything is done right. The 
	normal event day downtime is scheduled from 9am EST – 3pm EST. In order to 
	make sure all is well with the upgrade, Darktide will be down until 5pm EST 
	on that day. We do not foresee any issues with the upgrade, but we want the 
	extra time to make sure. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. We will have the February Letter to the 
	Players for you on Friday of this week, as well as a couple more teaser 
	images to go along with it. Everyone have a great week!<br>
