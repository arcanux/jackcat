	<p>
    In the wooded mountain slopes of northern Osteth, not far from the mines of 
	Baron Colier, Prince Borelean fought for his life. Alone in the wilderness, 
	away from the older warrior who had escorted him into the forest, he had had 
	been set upon by a pair of hulking, snake-headed Sclavus. Each was armed 
	with a long, curving, single-edged blade, similar in design to the tachis 
	that were popular among the Sho, and each bore a heavy iron kite shield, 
	which they had used expertly to force the prince to give ground until he was 
	backed against a tree, with no way to escape except to fight through his 
	foes. <br>
	<br>
	The prince was a superbly trained fighter, blessed with his mother's keen 
	reflexes and a growing portion of his father's prodigious strength, but his 
	endurance was flagging, his shield arm was aching from the repeated shock of 
	impact, and he was at a disadvantage against two strong foes with superior 
	height and reach. A powerful side-cut from one of those heavy swords had 
	dented the side of his black steel breastplate and cracked one of his ribs, 
	and his breath was coming harder by the moment.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, a break in the fight came, as the Sclavus to his right took a step 
	back and spread its arms wide to begin casting a spell. The Sclavus to his 
	left launched a series of wild swings at him to keep his attention and 
	provide cover for the spellcaster. Borelean had no intention of allowing 
	these creatures to use any of their foul magic on him. He shield-checked the 
	one on the left to create some space and brought his sword whipping down on 
	the skull of the one on the right. The sword cleaved deep into the 
	creature's skull, and stuck there. The Sclavus stopped its spellcasting and 
	collapsed to the ground, dead, but the prince's sword came with it.<br>
	<br>
	Before Borelean could stop to try and pull the sword from the skull of his 
	fallen foe, the other Sclavus slammed home with another attack, cracking 
	painfully into his shoulder. Again, his black plate armor absorbed most of 
	the blow and kept his flesh intact, but the sheer brute strength behind the 
	attack dented his armor again and sent a shock of impact reverberating 
	through his whole body. Borelean felt his head go light and felt the 
	strength go out of his shield arm, and through the haze of pain and 
	disorientation, he was dimly aware of the remaining Sclavus rearing up to 
	take another monstrous swing at him.<br>
	<br>
	In an instant, the prince shook off the cobwebs in his head, dropped the 
	dead weight of his shield, and dove sideways over the corpse of the Sclavus 
	he'd just brained. He rolled and landed in a crouch a couple of strides away 
	from the Sclavus. The snake-headed monster hissed in rage and advanced, 
	shield out in guard position and sword poised to strike again. Thinking 
	quickly, Borelean drew the dagger from his belt, waited for just the right 
	moment... And then he sprang upwards, mustering all the strength he had left 
	in him after this exhausting battle.<br>
	<br>
	The fierce, well-timed lunge brought him under the Sclavus's defenses, and 
	his aim with the dagger was true. Driven with all his remaining strength, 
	the point entered just behind the creature's chin and punched upward through 
	its skull and brain. The Sclavus seemed to sigh, and then its arms went limp 
	and it toppled forward. Borelean was too surprised to get out of the way, 
	and he felt twin blazes of agony from his ribs and shoulder as he hit the 
	ground with the dead brute on top of him.<br>
	<br>
	The prince ended up buried in the snow under twenty stone of dead, stinking 
	Sclavus, with gore and viscera dripping onto his face and chest. He groaned 
	in pain, wondering how he'd escape his predicament. Surely there would be 
	other Sclavus coming around soon, or perhaps a wandering Tanada assassin who 
	would be only too happy to slit his throat. He wondered where his companion 
	was, the older man who'd escorted him into the woods after he announced his 
	intention to get a look at the ritual site a few days in advance. He had 
	been hoping to see Hoshino Kei there as she finished preparing the site, but 
	this fight with Sclavus had ended any hopes he had of catching up with her.<br>
	<br>
	His question about his companion's whereabouts was answered by a slow 
	clapping above him. The older man was perched in the branches of the very 
	tree that he'd backed up against during the fight, and he was laughing.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pwyll's moldering hide, where did you go?&quot; the prince yelled, though he 
	could barely draw breath under the weight of his dead enemy.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I gave you some space to fight on your own, lad,&quot; was the man's cheerful 
	response. &quot;Very well done. Really a terrible job of strike control with the 
	first one, but good work with the dagger there at the end. Nice way to think 
	and react quickly to adverse conditions. Reminds me of this one warlord I 
	killed, back in Morain Province, after I took out his bodyguard...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I'm sure it's a great story, but what if those things had killed me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;They wouldn't have killed you. I was watching and ready the whole time. I 
	just wanted to see you deal with unexpected odds.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Certainly unexpected... I know these woods... Never seen anything that 
	powerful out here...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;And it was worthwhile to have you fight something totally unexpected. You 
	know more about yourself now than if you'd been surprised by some clumsy, 
	hairy red ape. You're already comfortable fighting those things. But here, 
	you found yourself outnumbered against a pair of foes that were easily your 
	physical equal, without the backup you assumed you'd have. That's real 
	fighting, Highness.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So this was all part of some plan?&quot; Borelean wheezed as he asked this 
	question, but his incredulity came through loud and clear.<br>
	<br>
	The older man laughed. &quot;I hadn't planned this, Highness. You overestimate my 
	deviousness. I simply took advantage of an unexpected windfall. And as for 
	whether or not I could have saved you if one of those snakes had gotten a 
	chance for a true killing blow...&quot; His hand flashed, and all of a sudden 
	there were three quivering daggers stuck in the corpse of the first fallen 
	Sclavus. The body twitched as electrical energy coursed through it. &quot;I could 
	have done the second one just as easily, but I thought you'd find it 
	unpleasant, since it's still on top of you and all.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean wasn't convinced that the older man could actually have saved him 
	from a mortal blow, but the point wasn't worth arguing any more. &quot;Please 
	just get me out from under this thing,&quot; he said, calmer now.<br>
	<br>
	The man leaped out of the tree, landing lightly in the snow nearby. &quot;As you 
	command, Highness,&quot; he smirked. &quot;I'm not even going to lecture you further 
	about getting your sword stuck in your opponent's head. You know what you 
	did wrong there.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The older man quickly rolled the corpse off the prince and helped him back 
	to his feet. He examined Borelean's shoulder and side. &quot;Dislocated shoulder, 
	broken rib. Honorable wounds, and a pretty light toll for combat with such 
	deadly opponents,&quot; he pronounced. &quot;At least they didn't disfigure your 
	pretty face.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean scowled but didn't rise to the bait. He concentrated on his Focus 
	of Verdancy to draw mana together and heal his wounds. The gore and the 
	dents on his armor would lead to questions when he returned to the palace, 
	but he had more important questions on his mind now.<br>
	<br>
	The prince looked up the hill. The four towers of the ritual site were just 
	a few hundred yards further north and up the slope, and he realized it 
	probably wasn't a coincidence that these out-of-place Sclavus had assaulted 
	him near the ritual site. &quot;Those Sclavus are generally servants of the 
	Falatacot,&quot; he said, more to himself than to his companion. &quot;They must be 
	here to disrupt the ritual. Let's go.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He dashed up the hill, and the older man had no choice but to follow him. 
	About a hundred yards away from the southernmost tower, the older man 
	stopped and put a cautioning hand on the prince's uninjured soldier. &quot;Do you 
	smell that?&quot; he asked, his face tense. &quot;There's a stink in the air... 
	Foulness... Decay...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I don't smell a thing,&quot; Borelean said, but he could sense something wrong 
	in the area. With his budding geomantic powers, he could feel a disturbance 
	in the lines of power that emanated from the ritual site. They came closer, 
	stepping cautiously, and the older man lost his careless demeanor. <br>
	<br>
	Finally they came to the edge of the clearing that contained the four towers 
	and the ritual platform. With a growing sense of dread, Borelean dashed to 
	each of the towers. He found the ritual golem still serving its lonely 
	vigil, and there were no signs of blood or struggle to indicate that Kei had 
	been attacked here, but...<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The orbs are missing,&quot; he said. He looked at his companion. &quot;Best make 
	yourself scarce. I have to return to the palace immediately and bring 
	reinforcements. I won't tell them you were with me.&quot; With his good hand, he 
	drew a portal gem from his belt pouch, then looked at the tracks in the snow 
	behind them. He hesitated.<br>
	<br>
	The older man studied his face, then glanced at the portal gem in Borelean's 
	hand. He answered the prince's unspoken question. &quot;Yes, old Tharnoch will be 
	smart enough to see the two tracks and start asking some questions. I'll 
	conceal my tracks when you're gone. Just go, lad. Go take care of your 
	responsibilities. We're done with our ranging. You did well, and I'd never 
	say different.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Apprehensive, Borelean turned away and crushed the gem on the ground. Just 
	before he was pulled into portalspace, he turned again for one last look at 
	his deadly, untrustworthy mentor. But the man was gone, and not even the 
	prints of his boots remained in the snow where he had been standing.</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Ardry watched the steam waft off the bowl of hot, 
	fragrant tea before him. He closed his eyes briefly and opened them back up, 
	half-expecting to wake up in front of his lifestone with the taste of blood 
	and dirt in his mouth. No such awakening occurred. He was still in the 
	modest but immaculate home of Ben Ten, sharing a bowl of tea with the 
	legendary protector of Dereth's early human settlements. He'd already spent 
	half an hour discussing his adventures in acquiring and decoding the clues 
	Asheron had left behind, but there was still something so surreal about 
	being in the home of a living legend that it all did seem like a dream to 
	him.<br>
	<br>
	The old woman watched him with a knowing smile. &quot;Please, Ardry, enjoy your 
	tea before it cools. It is perfectly drinkable this soon after serving. I do 
	not scald my tea leaves with boiling water like your Aluvian innkeeps always 
	seem to do.&quot; Her eyes twinkled with humor, but he was too distracted to 
	catch it.<br>
	<br>
	He bobbed his head nervously, took the bowl in his hands, and slowly, 
	reverently, sipped the tea. The tea was good, with a more subtle flavor than 
	he was used to. It did not fill him with any kind of mystical calm, but it 
	did warm him up after he'd spent several hours trekking through the 
	wilderness to find Ben Ten's small hut.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As I was saying, my lady, I am glad my notes and observations have been 
	helpful in your efforts to locate Asheron.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ben Ten sipped her own tea and nodded. &quot;Most helpful indeed. Your notes were 
	critical to our efforts. But please, do not call me 'lady'. I am just an old 
	soldier.&quot; She laughed merrily at this description. &quot;Please just call me Ben 
	Ten.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded. &quot;As you wish, my, uh, Ben Ten.&quot; He flushed in embarrassment. 
	&quot;Is there anything else I can do for you?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He meant the question in a perfunctory, polite way. But he saw her eyes 
	brighten in response to his question, and he suddenly became aware that she 
	was not here just to drink tea with him and review his notes on Asheron's 
	ciphers. Even as she began speaking, Ardry imagined he could hear a trap 
	springing shut on him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As a matter of fact, Ardry, I would ask your assistance again, though it 
	pains me to further impose on you.&quot; She did look honestly regretful, and 
	that helped. A little bit.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry shook his head. &quot;Please, Ben Ten, it would be an honor to further 
	serve. I am sure you wouldn't ask unless it was urgent.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	She nodded enthusiastically. &quot;You are quite right. Your selflessness is a 
	credit to your uncle, who always speaks so highly of you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry's eyes widened. &quot;You speak with my Uncle?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh yes. A fascinating conversationalist, is he not? He is a man of great 
	learning, filled with knowledge.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He's filled with something, all right. But I didn't mean to change the 
	subject. How can I help?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I would ask you to venture into hostile territory once more, Ardry. There 
	are few who have the skill and the prior experience to do what I would 
	ask...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded knowingly. &quot;You want me to go to Bur and find Asheron, right?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ben Ten laughed. &quot;Ardry, do not get ahead of yourself. Half the realm will 
	head to Bur. There will be many stout warriors, powerful mages, and clever 
	adventurers hot on Asheron's trail. I would ask you to do something else, 
	here on Dereth, which will not be as glamorous as journeying to another 
	world to find our lost benefactor.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry flushed again, embarrassed by his presumption that somehow he'd be 
	asked to be the hero who found Asheron. &quot;I understand, and I apologize for 
	interrupting. Please, go on.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ben Ten reached forward and patted his hand gently. &quot;Don't feel bad, Ardry. 
	I'm the one who ought to feel bad for asking you to go into the mountains 
	and seek out more Tanada.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry almost dropped his tea bowl. &quot;More Tanada?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The Tanada have not ceased their activities just because the rest of Dereth 
	is preoccupied with Bur and Asheron's disappearance,&quot; Ben Ten said.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry grimaced. &quot;I suppose it would have been too much to hope for.&quot; He felt 
	a familiar sense of resignation as he contemplated the idea of another 
	encounter with the vicious Nanjou Shou-Jen of the Tanada clan.<br>
	<br>
	Ben Ten watched him and laughed softly. &quot;I am sorry, Ardry, I am not 
	laughing at your expense... Not truly. It's just that I saw this sense of 
	calm and acceptance come over you. It normally takes a great deal of 
	meditation for a person to become that comfortable with pending danger.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry smiled grimly and took a long drink from his tea bowl. &quot;That's my 
	gift, I guess. I've got a preternatural ability to be at peace with the 
	thought of a violent and messy death.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ben Ten suddenly turned very serious and grabbed his hand. &quot;Do not 
	underestimate the value of such a gift, Ardry the Dubious. It is a gift, 
	believe that.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Suddenly scared, Ardry sat back. He and Ben Ten drank the rest of their tea 
	in silence.</span></p>

	January 12, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the January 2007 Letter to the players!<br>
	<br>
	The search for Asheron intensifies as the people of Dereth continue to seek 
	out his location. Through the gathering of various clues we have discovered 
	that Asheron is somewhere on the planet Bur. The problem we have now is how 
	do we get to this distant world and what do we do once we are there? Who 
	will help us find Asheron and bring him back home?<br>
	<br>
	<b>January Live Ops</b><br>
	The voices of the town criers ring out across the land, announcing that 
	Prince Borelean Strathelar will be attempting to summon a portal to the 
	world of Bur in an attempt to find Asheron, who is suspected to be in the 
	clutches of the vile Falatacot. All men and women of stout heart are asked 
	to assist if they can, as he believes that there may be opposition from the 
	Falatacot and their servants. King Varicci has stated publically that he 
	will neither support nor hinder this effort, feeling it beneath his notice, 
	and that individuals loyal to Viamont may choose to support this effort if 
	they wish.<br>
	<br>
	In the past, players have asked for a schedule when we run important, 
	story-based live-ops. We do listen, and so we are providing the schedule of 
	the various runs of the Portal to Bur live-op. All live-ops will run at 10 
	PM Eastern Standard Time. The dates of the live-op are as follows:<br>
	<br>
	January 22: Leafcull<br>
	<br>
	January 23: Solclaim<br>
	<br>
	January 24: Thistledown<br>
	<br>
	January 25: Morningthaw<br>
	<br>
	January 29: Wintersebb<br>
	<br>
	January 30: Frostfell<br>
	<br>
	January 31: Harvestgain<br>
	<br>
	February 1: Verdantine<br>
	<br>
	February 2: Darktide<br>
	<br>
	Please note that Prince Borelean will want the portal site as prepared as 
	possible on the day of the ritual. If the site is not ready, there may be 
	delays so that the portal site may be prepared. As for what constitutes 
	preparedness, we encourage players to log into the game and find out!<br>
	<br>
	<b>Caul Isle XP</b><br>
	After reading feedback from players on the forums as well as speaking to the 
	team, we feel the XP yield on the Caul should be returned to its original 
	numbers. A couple of years ago the xp was lowered because it was too high. 
	We had originally said this would not make it in until the February event; 
	however the team was able to make this adjustment for the January event<br>
	<br>
	<b>Housing timer clarification</b><br>
	The message that players get about the timer on housing can be a bit 
	confusing. The message that players got before was: Housing cannot be 
	purchased by accounts less than 15 days old. This message has been changed 
	to: You may not purchase housing until your account has been active on this 
	game world for 15 days. This will hopefully clear up any confusion regarding 
	the purchase of housing. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Quest Changes</b><br>
	In the Finding Asheron string of quests, players are not informed they are 
	working towards accessing the location of Asheron. This has been changed and 
	the rumors players get for the quests now allude to them having more of a 
	purpose, as well as clarifying the level breaks on the quests. <br>
	<br>
	There was an issue with one of the decoy goblets on the Following Asheron's 
	Trail quest where it had the same description as the actual goblet players 
	needed to get, This was causing confusion to some people running the quest. 
	This has been fixed and the description is no longer the same. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. Each month we 
	will be discussing one new in concept topic, in order to give you as much 
	information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	<b>In-Game Mail System</b><br>
	We want to continue to update Asheron's Call with more features that allow 
	the gameplay experience to evolve. To that end, one of the things we are 
	investigating is the addition of an in-game mail system. This would work in 
	the same way that it does in most other games. You would be able to send a 
	limited number of items, money, or text notes to other players online or 
	offline. Ideally this system would work by simply clicking on special 
	mailboxes located throughout the landscape to open your mail interface. 
	Right now this is still in the investigation stage of development, but it is 
	something that we would love to make available to our players.<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	January and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	January event.</p>
