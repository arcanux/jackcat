	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope you all had a nice weekend, and for those of 
	us in the US, a nice long weekend. Let’s get right into what’s going on this 
	week. <br>
	<br>
	As most of you know already Digital Distribution went live last week. While 
	I won’t give out the numbers, let’s just say that from what I have seen so 
	far, the launch was a big success. So now you may ask… What is next? What is 
	in store for Asheron’s Call now? Well that’s what I am here to tell you all.
	<br>
	<br>
	In the coming weeks we will be launching an advertising campaign for 
	Asheron’s Call. You will be seeing ads for the game popping up in many 
	places it has never been. When the time comes that these ads are out there 
	and live, I will do my best to point them all out so you can see what we are 
	doing. <br>
	<br>
	Is that it? Not hardly!<br>
	<br>
	We want to prove to you, our loyal players that we are committed to this 
	franchise and its longevity. One of the ways we can do this is improving 
	server performance. So, on June 8th, 2006 we will be doing major hardware 
	maintenance on the Database server. This means that the worlds will be down 
	for an extended period of time. As of right now the downtime is going to be 
	from 4am EST - 6pm EST. We know this is a long time for the worlds to be 
	down, but this maintenance is the first step towards improving performance 
	across all worlds. <br>
	<br>
	What do you mean the first step?<br>
	<br>
	You also may recall that not so long ago we did a hardware upgrade to 
	Darktide. Well now all of the other worlds will be getting this hardware 
	upgrade. We will be doing this upgrade on June 15th, which is also the 
	tentative date we have scheduled for the June event, <b>From the Darkest 
	Depths</b>. We do not expect any complications from this upgrade, since we 
	have done it already, but to be prepared we are going extend the downtime 
	window on that day to 8am EST – 6pm EST. When players log back in on the 
	15th, the upgrade will be completed. <br>
	<br>
	There you have it. We have alot of things in store for Asheron’s Call in the 
	coming weeks and months, and I will do my best to keep you all informed as 
	to what is happening and when. <br>
	<br>
	Well that’s about it for now. I hope you all have a great week, and see you 
	all in Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hello there everyone! I hope you all had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	I want to start off with a reminder of this week’s upcoming downtime on 
	Thursday June 8th, from 4am EST - 6pm EST. This downtime is needed to 
	replace and prepare the database servers for the upcoming world server 
	upgrades. We are very excited about these changes and we hope you all are as 
	well. I will do my best to keep you updated on the status of this downtime 
	throughout the day; though I fear most of the updates will be as simple as 
	“Everything is still on schedule and going smooth”.<br>
	<br>
	Let’s get on to what we are doing this week. The team is busy going through 
	the June event and making sure that everything is working and ready to go 
	live. This includes the final runs at balancing things to the way we like, 
	and making sure that everything is working correctly. This is the time that 
	we get to run through all of the new content a couple of times and have some 
	fun testing the new stuff. <br>
	<br>
	We are also in the process of getting our designs ready for the July event. 
	This is the time where we sit down and figure out where we want to go in 
	July and how we want the events to unfold. <br>
	<br>
	Unless something major is found to cause a delay, I will be releasing the 
	June Letter to the Players on Friday, along with a little bonus surprise for 
	the June event that we are working on.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="smile" alt="" src="price/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. This is a busy week for us as we head into the June 
	event, and as always if there is anymore news or updates about what is going 
	on this week I will make sure and post it here.<br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a great week, and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hi there everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend. Some of here in 
	the Boston area got to see the sun for the first time is quite a while, 
	which made for a nice weekend. <br>
	<br>
	First I would like to announce that Asheron’s Call: Throne of Destiny is now 
	available for Digital Distribution from our Turbine store as well as 
	Direct2Drive. You can also still purchase the physical box of the game from 
	our store for the lowered price of $19.95. This is yet another step in 
	making sure that everyone who wants to purchase the game, can do so with 
	ease. <br>
	<br>
	You can purchase the digital version the game
	<a target="_blank" href="http://store.turbine.com/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayPage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;id=ProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=turbine&amp;productID=42828800&amp;Env=BASE">
	here</a>. <br>
	You can purchase the full game including the box, manual, and disk
	<a target="_blank" href="http://store.turbine.com/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayPage&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;id=ProductDetailsPage&amp;SiteID=turbine&amp;productID=36341200&amp;Env=BASE">
	here</a>. <br>
	<br>
	We would also like to take this opportunity to update to you on the upcoming 
	schedule of downtimes. We had initially scheduled a window of 8am EST – 6pm 
	EST for the June event update. This time has now been revised to 8am EST – 
	4pm EST. During this time we will not be doing the previously scheduled 
	hardware upgrades to the game worlds. We will instead be doing these 
	upgrades on the following week. On Wednesday June 21, the world will be down 
	from 10am EST – 2pm EST for the hardware upgrades. We decided to do the 
	downtime separately so that if there is an issue, it will not affect the 
	June event. We all feel this is the best way to make sure that things go as 
	smooth as they can during this process. <br>
	<br>
	Now on to what else is going on in that land of Asheron’s Call this week. As 
	an additional bonus to this months Letter to the Players, we have released a 
	teaser trailer for the June event. You can find the June Letter to the 
	Players <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=466">here</a>, 
	along with the Event fiction. <br>
	<br>
	You can view the teaser movie by clicking
	<a target="_blank" href="http://download.turbine.com/ac1/video/ac1_june_Movie_small.wmv">
	here</a>! <br>
	<br>
	Well that’s about it for this week. Have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>
