	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope everyone had a great weekend. I would like 
	to start this update off with a heart felt thank you. Due to scheduling 
	conflicts and a very serious family issue, I have not been here as much as 
	would have like over the last few weeks. Hopefully all of that is behind us, 
	and things can get back to normal… Well as normal as things can be around 
	here.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="smile" alt="" src="depths/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	I am not going to try and sugar coat things at this point. It would be an 
	insult to everyone’s intelligence for me to do that. The big issue right now 
	is the current state of the Authentication servers. As I write this update 
	the team is still investigating the issues. Now I know alot of people are 
	sitting back saying, “It’s been a week! Why hasn’t this been fixed yet?” 
	Since I am not well versed in the world of operations, all I can tell you is 
	what has been told to me. What I know is that everyone that is able to help 
	with this, is working on it. Looking at every possible reason this might be 
	happening, from hardware to code to everything in-between. No one here is 
	taking this lightly, and everyone is working as hard as they can to get this 
	solved as quickly as we can. Other projects are getting pushed off so that 
	we can solve this before going forward with anything else. <br>
	<br>
	We all greatly appreciate all of your understanding with us through this 
	difficult time. We know this is not something that is easy to get past, when 
	players want to get in and play, they expect to be able to do that whenever 
	they want to. We know this and I will say it again. We are doing everything 
	in our power to get this issue fixed. <br>
	<br>
	Now we know some players have already begun asking for some form of 
	compensation. At this point we have brought it up, but we will not seriously 
	discuss it until we have the issues resolved.<br>
	<br>
	Other than the big subject of the week, the team has been working hard to 
	get the July event done. The testing is in its final phases and so far 
	everything is going well. Since I am a week or so behind, I am going to do 
	my best to get the monthly teaser images as soon as I can this week. I just 
	have to find the time while trying to catch up on everything that I have 
	missed. They have also completed writing the content for August and have 
	begun implementation and testing of that content. <br>
	<br>
	That is about it for now. Right now all of our focus is on getting the login 
	issues resolved as soon as we can, so that everyone can back to playing AC 
	and enjoying the content the team rolls out each month.<br>
	<br>
	Have a great day, and see you all in Dereth!<br>

    <p><strong><a name="3"></a>Re: Changes made to Authentication, Please read. 
	7/1<span lang="en-us">1</span>/06 </strong>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b>-<b> 7/1<span lang="en-us">2</span>/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showpost.php?p=295972&amp;postcount=100">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>So I wanted to take this time to give you an update as to where we stand. 
	Our continued testing and the downtime today has helped us locate what we 
	think to be the problem. That is the good news. The bad news is that the 
	issue is with some code that is very deeply imbedded in the 
	billing/authentication system. What that means is while we know what the 
	problem is; we are going to have to be very careful working on a fix. If 
	something were to go wrong with any fix we try to implement, it could break 
	the billing and authentication system even more than it already is. And we 
	don't want that. <br>
	<br>
	So we have the first attempt at a fix getting ready to be sent over to our 
	QA department. While this is good, due to the sensitivity of the issue, it 
	will take some time to test. This means as much as we would like it, the fix 
	will more than likely not be in place today, but we are very optimistic that 
	we will have a fix in place by the end of the week.<br>
	<br>
	We greatly appreciate all of the help we have gotten from the players and 
	everyone else who has been helping us get to the bottom of this issue. When 
	we have more information, I will post it and hopefully have some more good 
	news.<br>

	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hello there everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	Let’s get right into things for this week. I have some good news and some 
	bad news. We are going to start with the bad news, which in a way is related 
	to the good news. The bad news is that we are going to have to delay the 
	launch of the July event for one week. The new date set for the July event 
	is July 25th. As we continued to test some new content we found that we just 
	needed more time to balance things out and get some needed fixes into the 
	game. We gave ourselves a heavy workload this month, and we want to make 
	sure that things are done right. This also means that the July Letter to the 
	Players will not be coming out until this Friday, July 21st. <br>
	<br>
	This brings us to the good news which is related to the heavy workload that 
	I already mentioned. You may recall in a past LttP’s that we mentioned one 
	of our In-Concept items was additional high level outdoor hunting. By this 
	time many of you have completed the Raising Grael’s Island quest. Well in 
	July, this island will be come open to players. This new landmass is aimed 
	at players level 150+ and is going to contain some new spawn dynamics we 
	have been working on. Unlike Vissidal Island, players will no longer want to 
	“Cherry Pick” certain creatures from a spawn to get better loot or the 
	special drop. In the case of this new island, players will be encouraged to 
	kill the entire spawn they are hunting in order to get that special creature 
	with the item to spawn.<br>
	<br>
	This new spawn dynamic is also something we are looking in to adding to some 
	of the regular landscape spawns throughout Dereth. If we decide to add this 
	dynamic to regular spawns, you may find yourself suddenly involved in a 
	mini-boss type fight when you least expect it. We feel this could definitely 
	spice things up a bit for those players who enjoy outdoor hunting and a few 
	surprises.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="smile" alt="" src="depths/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	We have also deployed a fix for those players having authentication issues. 
	We are hopeful this will resolve these issue and we will be able to move on 
	with improving Asheron’s Call. We will be continually monitoring things to 
	see just what the results of these changes are. We once again thank all of 
	you for your understanding while we worked through these issues. It is 
	appreciated, and we will discuss more of that appreciation in a future 
	update. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth<br>

    <p><strong><a name="4"></a>Weekly Update</strong> <b>&nbsp;</b>-<b> 7/24/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?t=30646">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hello everyone. I hope that you all had a great weekend. Things were a 
	little soggy here, but overall it was a good weekend.<br>
	<br>
	Let’s get in to what is going on this week.<br>
	<br>
	First off we have some news about forum upgrades. On Thursday July 27th we 
	will be bringing down the forums at 10am EST so we can upgrade to the latest 
	version of vBulletin, which for those who don’t know is the software that 
	runs these forums. This will allow us to add more features to the forums and 
	to have much more freedom over what features we can use here. As part of 
	this upgrade we are also going to be changing these forums over to a system 
	where you will need to be a subscriber to post. We are working on a way for 
	non-subscribers to be able to post in a separate forum also, but for the 
	time being you will need to have an active game account in order to post. 
	Everyone will still be able to read everything that is posted on the forums.
	<br>
	<br>
	After the upcoming forum downtime on Thursday when everyone tries to view 
	the forums, they will be prompted to enter a username and password from an 
	active game account that they want to associate with their forum account. 
	That’s it. After that you will be able to go to the forums and post as 
	normal, but we will now be able to track information easier. Also bear in 
	mind that this means your forum account is linked to your game account in 
	every way. If you break the Code of Conduct in the game and get banned, it 
	could also affect your forum account, and vice- versa. We feel this new 
	system will be better for everyone involved. <br>
	<br>
	A reminder that tomorrow, Tuesday July 25th is the day we push out the July 
	event Toward Ancient Shores. All worlds will be down from 8am EST – 3pm EST. 
	During that time players will not be able to log in to the game. We would 
	also like to remind players that during the event that there will be several 
	un-announced Live Events taking place in locations all over Dereth. That 
	means that all players should be mindful of where they log out certain 
	characters on their accounts. You never know what you might log in to. <br>
	<br>
	And just so the issue is not ignored, we are still in discussions about 
	possible compensation for players due to the recent authentication issues. 
	When we have more information on this we will let you know. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great day. See you all in Dereth!<br>
