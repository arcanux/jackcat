	<p><span lang="en-us">Captain Tharnoch crouched behind a tall rock, 
	perfectly concealed against the mottled texture of the stone. He had 
	followed his Queen's orders all the way to this desolate and dangerous 
	perch. His eyes scanned a beach strewn with many of these large rock 
	formations and the enormous shells of dead mollusks. A stone's throw away, 
	the pale sands gave way to cliffs of black rock. At the base of the black 
	cliffs, a group of three Ruschk stood together, muttering to each other with 
	grunts and hisses. As yet, they were still unaware of his presence, but that 
	would change soon enough, as soon as he'd completed his observations... <br>
	<br>
	He strained to listen to what they were saying, but the rhythmic crash of 
	waves and the call of seabirds interfered with his hearing. He had heard 
	enough to be able to tell that these Ruschk were not like the ones he'd 
	spent years fighting on the Halaetans. The darkness of the night sky, with 
	one moon still obscured by mysterious darkness, similarly made it difficult 
	for him to properly examine his foes. The brutes did not seem to have the 
	same coloration as their Halaetan cousins. Even under the light of a new 
	moon, the Ruschk of the frigid islands seemed to glow with a chill inner 
	light. These Ruschk were dark – so dark that they seemed to suck in the pale 
	light reflected by the sands of this strange shore.<br>
	<br>
	Cursing inwardly, Tharnoch decided he'd need to risk a closer approach. He 
	paused to take a drink from his flask to fortify himself. He felt the 
	enchanted brew burning through him as he swallowed, and his limbs grew 
	lighter and stronger. That done, he started to creep forward, very slowly, 
	trying to keep himself in the shadow of the rocks. He got close enough to 
	get a good look at the masked face of one of the brutes. Its eyes were not 
	the pale blue he'd expected, but dark and empty, like holes into an empty 
	void. Then the smell hit him – the stink of corpses and corruption. He 
	wrinkled his nose and reached for his sword.<br>
	<br>
	At that moment, one of the Ruschk noticed him, roared in rage, and charged 
	at him. The other two quickly joined in the attack. The old warrior drew his 
	blade, glowing with runes of powerful enchantments, and braced his shield to 
	meet the charge. The first charging Ruschk barreled into him, and the shock 
	of the impact was stronger than Tharnoch expected. He threw himself 
	backwards, still agile after almost thirty years of battle, and rolled back 
	to his feet in a better defensive posture.<br>
	<br>
	The Ruschk came onward, battering at his shield and armor with heavy, clawed 
	hands. He struck back, swinging his sword in powerful arcs. Lumps of black 
	flesh and foul, corrupted gore went flying as Tharnoch hacked at his 
	assailants. He concentrated on the first one that had attacked him, 
	determined to cut them down one at a time, warding off the other two as well 
	as he could. No matter how hard he hit it, the foul beast kept swinging 
	wildly along with its companions. Their fists struck his shield with all the 
	force of a Viamontian warrior's flanged mace. A particularly nasty swipe 
	from the one on his right cracked a rib, and the one on the left smashed his 
	shield so hard that his entire left arm went numb.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, the first one fell, after absorbing a dozen of Tharnoch's best 
	hits. Defending now against two of these unnatural monsters, he was able to 
	settle into a more comfortable battle rhythm. He had enough space to 
	maneuver to use his feet as well as his shield to avoid attacks. They still 
	managed to hit him, and hit hard, but he felt more in control of the fight. 
	Not so long after the second one fell, the last of the three monsters fell 
	in a pile of splintered bones and withered flesh.<br>
	<br>
	He unslung his shield, drove the point of his sword into the ground, and 
	knelt on one knee, letting his weary shoulders droop for a moment of rest. 
	All around him, puddles of blood and gore steamed and began to sink into the 
	sand.<br>
	<br>
	He rested his right hand on the hilt of his sword as he reached for the 
	flask of health potion on his belt. This entire island looked to be infested 
	with very dangerous beasts, and he knew he wouldn't have much time to 
	recover on his own. He unstopped the cork with his thumb and raised the 
	flask to his lips, when he saw a purple light behind him, reflected in the 
	polished metal. Without stopping to think, he rolled forward. There was a 
	roar, and the ground shook behind him.<br>
	<br>
	When he managed to get to his feet and spin to face the new threat, his 
	heart sank. Three more of these blackened Ruschk stood where he had been. 
	The one in the middle towered above the others, and stood taller even than a 
	man. His shield lay in the sand where he'd let it fall, inconveniently by 
	the feet of the oversized brute. He knew he wouldn't be able to get to it to 
	defend himself. He whispered a prayer as the big one, clearly some kind of a 
	chieftain or leader, gestured at him, and the two smaller ones advanced.<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch prepared to throw himself forward, determined at least to slay the 
	large one before the others tore him to pieces. He took the first step, and 
	then was thrown off-balance by another flash of purple light, this one 
	behind the leader. The big Ruschk didn't even get a chance to turn around 
	before a glowing blade erupted from its chest. Black viscera sprayed all 
	over the sand. The creature's limbs jerked once and went limp. A shriek 
	pierced the air, and Tharnoch could not decide if the sound came from the 
	dying Ruschk or from the blade that had killed it. The creature pitched 
	forward into the sand like a practice dummy cut loose from its frame and 
	landed with a moist, meaty thump.<br>
	<br>
	The other two Ruschk, seemingly confused by the fall of their leader, 
	paused. Tharnoch didn't hesitate. He leaped to attack the nearest one. He 
	was dimly aware that another combatant, whoever it was who had killed the 
	leader, had stepped forward to engage the other.<br>
	<br>
	In a matter of moments, both of the remaining Ruschk had met the same fate 
	as their leader. Tharnoch turned warily to confront the newcomer, sword up 
	and ready to defend himself. He knew that this unknown warrior had saved his 
	life, but he wasn't going to let himself be taken by surprise.<br>
	<br>
	He almost dropped his sword once he got a look at the man's face.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's you!&quot; he cried out, shocked to be confronted by this specter from a 
	lifetime and a world past...<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's me,&quot; the other agreed pleasantly.</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Aliester the Loquacious sat at his workshop table in 
	the waning light of afternoon. He peered closely into the crucible 
	containing his latest metallurgical experiment. The vessel was caked with a 
	black, useless sludge. He prodded at the thick residue with a scraper. There 
	was no evidence that there had ever been gold in the crucible. He sighed, 
	muttering to himself.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Surely my august and benevolent colleagues of the Council of Sages would 
	find this to be a noteworthy occasion: I am the first metallurgist in all 
	the known realms to have found the method by which an overeducated and 
	undertrained fool may turn gold into dross.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	There was a noise from outside his window. It sounded like a snort of 
	laughter, a sound Aliester was used to hearing from his nephew Ardry. He 
	turned, expecting to see the young scout, and almost dropped the crucible in 
	surprise. An Aluvian man dressed in black leather armor stood outside his 
	window with an amused expression. It was very definitely not Ardry.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Who are you? Why are you here?&quot; Aliester set down the crucible and reached 
	for the small dagger he kept by his desk, though he could tell just by 
	looking at the stranger's confident stance and leanly muscled arms that the 
	dagger would probably do him more harm than good, if this stranger had ill 
	intent for him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I've come a long way to find the legendary sage, Aliester the Loquacious,&quot; 
	the stranger said in worshipful tones. &quot;Would you be that esteemed 
	gentleman, sir?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Mollified, Aliester sat back and smiled. &quot;Well, yes, I have the dubious 
	honor to be that man you seek, sir. How did you find me here?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Mutual friends, sir. Your nephew Ardry, and a few others, recommended your 
	name to me because of your research in certain... rare materials. Especially 
	as such rare materials might relate to metallurgy. Forgive me, I have been 
	rude. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Adso.&quot; He extended his hand 
	through the open window to shake hands.<br>
	<br>
	Aliester took his hand and noted the casually crushing grip of this young 
	warrior. He stood and gestured inside. &quot;If you have come to share some 
	extraordinary or unique materials with me, please, do come in and avail 
	yourself of my hospitality, atrophied as my social courtesies may be. I can 
	mix up some fine tea for you, perhaps, or if you are more of a drinker...&quot; 
	He reached for another crucible and a sealed glass jar.<br>
	<br>
	Adso bowed. &quot;My regrets, great sage, I must be rude and refuse your 
	invitation. My duties take me many places today. But I was asked to bring 
	you some things, for your inspection...&quot; Without a by-your-leave, he dropped 
	a sack on Aliester's window sill. Aliester cautiously looked inside. A 
	powerful smell, sharp and corrosive, assaulted him as soon as he opened the 
	bag.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pwyll's thrice-blessed bones, man! What is this?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Trophies from a dark and terrible new place, great sage. You may have heard 
	or felt the shaking of the ground as a new island...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Aliester waved his hand dismissively. &quot;Say no more, young man. I am well 
	aware of the geologic and geomantic instabilities that gave rise to yet 
	another eruption of long-buried land from the sea floor. I have, indeed, 
	been looking for materials culled from the singular and one might even say 
	anomalous native fauna of the so-called Dark Isle... I had expected my 
	nephew to bring me samples, but if he sent you in his place...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded impatiently. &quot;Yes, he sent me here with as many trophies as I 
	could quickly gather. We have found that there are mystical properties 
	common to these items, as if all the creatures of the island were tainted in 
	the same...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Naturally! You will, of course, be familiar with my works on the unique 
	magical emanations of Shadow and Crystal shards and their applications in 
	the smithing of enchanted armor. If not, I do believe I have at least one or 
	two copies of my most relevant treatise here at hand...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;A generous offer, great sage, but I must get on with my duties. Please just 
	send a report to Ardry and to the rest of the Council of Sages when you have 
	completed your investigations.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Aliester, busily inspecting a rotting black fin, waved his free hand 
	absent-mindedly.<br>
	<br>
	Adso leaned close to the old man. &quot;And please, do hurry. There have been 
	reports that King Varicci seeks to unlock the mysteries of these trophies 
	himself. While he is no longer our most pressing threat, it would be a shame 
	if he were to gain some kind of research advantage to exploit later.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes... Varicci... exploit... bad...&quot; Aliester was sniffing the withered fin 
	like a dog seeking out a buried bone. &quot;Fine armor, I am sure...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso turned and walked away. The sage's house was on the edge of a great 
	forest, far from any other settlements. A fair number of trees on the 
	forest's edge had been chopped down to feed the fires in Aliester's 
	workshop. Ardry had told them that the isolation was meant to spare the 
	lives of any innocents should one of the sage's experiments prove to be 
	explosive. He and his Master had come a long way off their normal path just 
	to bring that bag of rotting trophies to the old man.<br>
	<br>
	When he re-entered the forest, his Master joined him. &quot;How did it go?&quot; the 
	older man asked.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well enough, Master. He is quite enchanted with the samples. I don't think 
	it will take him long to investigate them and write a report.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Excellent, Adso. Once his report has been distributed, practical 
	applications should follow quickly.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded, but his face showed confusion. His Master noticed, stopped 
	walking, and turned to look at him directly. &quot;Is there something wrong, Adso? 
	Please, speak freely.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso stopped to think, trying to couch his words in diplomatic terms. 
	&quot;Master, when you recruited me... I had been led to believe certain 
	things... in certain priorities... Well, venturing to that island, battling 
	those terrible beasts, just to deliver some creature samples to an 
	absent-minded researcher for the good of the realm... It seems...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Entirely too altruistic and out of character for me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded reluctantly. His Master took a deep breath. &quot;Even those who make 
	their living in the darkness need there to be some light, Adso. My own 
	Master taught me that. Are you afraid that I have lost my way? That I am 
	saving lives, instead of taking them? That I now seek to live in peace with 
	the benighted lackwits who share this unfortunate world with me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No, Master, I would never presume—&quot; <br>
	<br>
	His Master's eyes gleamed in the twilight. &quot;Good. Presumption is a dangerous 
	thing, Adso. I trust this is the last conversation we will have to have 
	about my motivations.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Of course, Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Because once you start questioning my motivations, you may stop following 
	my orders. And if I cannot rely on you to follow orders...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso's eyes widened in horror. &quot;Never, Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	His Master studied him for a long time. Adso met his eyes without flinching, 
	but he could not help but sweat under the intense scrutiny.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I believe you, Adso. All I have done, I do to serve a greater end. You will 
	have learned another valuable lesson by the time all this is done. One of 
	the last lessons I have to teach you, in fact.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso sighed in relief. &quot;As you say, Master.&quot; With that settled, Master and 
	Apprentice resumed their journey into the darkening woods.</span></p>

	With the emergence of Grael and his minions, the citizens of Dereth once

	The Shadow invasions in many of the towns across Dereth were a chilling 
	reminder that no matter how safe we feel, evil still lurks, waiting to 
	strike. Many fear that this is the time that Grael will begin to bring 
	terror to all the land. What is in store for the people of Dereth next? Will 
	we be able to stand up to the might of Grael and his armies?<br>

	In order to help the ever increasing number of new players coming into the 
	game we have created new racial sets of armor for new characters coming into 
	Dereth. These new armor sets have a higher armor level and have some more 
	helpful spells than previous versions of starter armor. We love our new 
	players and want to help them along their way to a long life here in Dereth.
	<br>
	<br>
	There will be a large number of unscheduled live events occurring this month 
	at all times of the day. Please be aware these can happen in any town at any 
	time, so please be aware when placing characters in towns. You may log in to 
	a less than friendly greeting. <br>
	<br>
	We believe we have found the source of the issue that was causing some 
	characters to end up at their lifestone's upon login. A fix is in place but 
	it will require players to log on their main characters first and open up 
	their housing. The mules should then be safe to log in and should not end up 
	back at their lifestone's. Players will be able to close their houses after 
	doing this and should not have to open them again unless they choose to. 
	Unfortunately this fix may not solve the problem for everyone, and there 
	still may be isolated incidents of characters till ending up at their 
	Lifestone. When and if this happens we will continue to investigate the 
	matter. <br>
	<br>
	The Cartographers of Dereth have been hard at work this month. You will 
	notice that the Points of Interest have returned to your in-game maps.<br>
	<br>
	A new island has appeared in the northeast. The area is aimed at characters 
	level 150+.<br>
	<br>
	There is a new creature roaming Dereth. While this little thing might appear 
	cute, please use caution when approaching, it has a quite a bite!<br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept<br>
	</b>These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. 
	We cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, 
	as scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to 
	the new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. With each 
	monthly event we will be discussing an in concept topic, in order to give 
	you as much information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	For some time now players have been asking for some skills in the game to 
	become more useful. In the coming months that is exactly what we want to do, 
	starting with the Alchemy and Cooking skills. While these skills have some 
	use right now, there is no real reason for players to take or keep these 
	skills on there characters that are higher levels. Our goal going forward is 
	to make these skills once again useful for players at all levels of gameplay. 
	At this point we will not get into the specifics of this, we want to make 
	these skills useful for characters that are less focused on combat, and more 
	focused on the trade skills in general. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	July and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	July event.<br>
