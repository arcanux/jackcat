	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The possible fix for this took no more than a 
	few hours. <br>
	<br>
	Removing the portal home tech would break more than it fixes. <br>
	What it'll fix:<br>
	1. creatures will no longer try to portal home when they can't reach home.<br>
	What it'll break:<br>
	1. instead of portaling home when they can't find home creature's will just 
	fly in circles endlessly until you manage to draw aggro or kill them.<br>
	2. creatures in dungeons will get stuck on walls/corners and will not return 
	home as long as the dungeon is active.<br>
	3. creatures will get stuck on landscape and continue to try to get home 
	while stuck until they aggro on something, someone kills them, or the 
	landblock unloads.<br>
	<br>
	The fix, innitialy, was largely due to the crystal golem exploit, yes, but 
	it fixed more than just people being able to exploit one creature, it also 
	stopped creatures from piling up in locations of dungeons and not being able 
	to get home, creatures piling up on landscape features that were impassable, 
	and otherwise allowed creatures to go home when they would have been stuck 
	in some other behavior.</font></p>

	<br>
	Hello there and welcome to this weeks update on what is happening in the 
	world of Asheron’s Call. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is busy working on things for the April event. We are at 
	the point in development where things are being placed on the test servers 
	and the team begins to tweak, adjust and balance out all of the new content 
	they are working on. <br>
	<br>
	We had a busy day on Friday, with lots of game industry press in the 
	building for various reasons. We spent a good part of the day with some of 
	these folks talking about gaming in general and what the future has in store 
	for us. Our friends over at Warcry have posted about the visit today, which 
	you can read about
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.warcry.com/scripts/news/view_news.phtml?site=5&amp;id=69935">
	here</a>. We even got a bit of a mention from the folks over at the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://lotrovault.ign.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&amp;id=42">
	LotRO Vault</a>. It was great to meet the people behind some of the bigger 
	sites and publications and to talk about what is in store for AC in the 
	future. It was a fun day and I think we will be seeing some benefits from 
	meeting with these folks in the future. <br>
	<br>
	There has been a rather large amount of great suggestions for the game 
	coming in to us lately, either through the forums here or via email. We 
	wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for all of the wonderful 
	ideas and suggestions. I am not sure what has spawned all of these great 
	ideas as of late, but please by all means keep them coming. While the team 
	here works very hard to get the best content and features out that they can, 
	the only way we know what the players want is the continued communication 
	that we have with you all. You cannot imagine how helpful you all have been, 
	and continue to be as we move forward with the game. From the very bottom of 
	our hearts we just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for the ideas, thank 
	you for supporting us, and thank you for being here and sharing in the joy 
	we all get from working on and playing this game. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week.<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was thinking about this today and it may be 
	more difficult than I thought, sadly. Pretty much the way it works is, 
	there's a field available for weapons that can be filled with special data, 
	this field is used to record if an item has a special effect, such as mukkir 
	slayer on it so that other effects can not be added. However, I failed to 
	take into account that the item would also need to know how to fix each 
	specific change. It seemed fairly easy to clear out the slayer types and 
	amount fields, but then with items like the rabbits foot and dark idol that 
	change other stats this suddenly becomes difficult. As a one trick pony it 
	was easy, it just cleared out some fields on any weapon and left it, however 
	variance, melee defense and other changes that do not always occur and are 
	not a field that can simply be cleared out would not be changable so easily. 
	This means that the removal would have to be able to figure out what effect 
	is on the weapon then remove it in a specific way, either that or each type 
	of stone has a specific removal item that needs to also be able to know 
	which effect is on a weapon.<br>
	<br>
	It would seem to be a bit less trivial than first expected but I put in a 
	suggestion for it anyway.</font></p>

	I'm unaware of any bugs that we don't have in for possible fixes. It's all a 
	matter of how much time Sev needs to do something. To do something like this 
	Sev most likely needs about 3 hours, to fix the return home bug we need to 
	figure out what's wrong so that'll most likely take a while of trying to get 
	it to repro on test then debug the situation, to fix combat stances breaking 
	when you enter them will most likely take a few weeks of work time because 
	Sev hasn't worked with those systems much yet. If you've got some new 
	amazing bug to complain about feel free to let us know and if it's a bug 
	we'll look into fixing it.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not a bug, it's a very good quest bow. It's

	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, but you are most incorrect, having these 
	two banes are absolutely useful.<br>
	<br>
	Why?<br>
	<br>
	Were you to cast negative level 7 item magic spells on the shield it would 
	lower the proteaction for acid and cold down to poor. However, if you have 
	it buffed with these two level 7 spells over the unpar and you cast negative 
	level 7 spells on the shield it still appears as unpar because the negative 
	and positive level 7s balance out.<br>
	<br>
	So, the lesson here is that, yes, 2.0 is max, just as 0 is max for speed, 
	but casting a spell that would go beyond the max, were it possible, will 
	actually protect you from negative effects.<br>
	<br>
	This is also true if you have a dagger with 20 speed, you could cast Swift 
	Killer 2 on it but if you do, in the event that Leaden Weapon 7 is cast on 
	it Leaden Weapon = -70, add that to Swift Killer 2 -70+20 = -50. So, your 
	total speed will end up at 50. Now, were you to cast Swift Killer 7 on your 
	weapon, and someone were to cast Leaden Weapon 7 on your weapon they'd 
	balance out and you'd end up at 20, much better than 50.</font></p>

	We wanted a hunting area that required people to pay attention and hunt 
	smart. We imagined that it would be difficult to set up and mindlessly hunt 
	the graveyard without paying attention. Wandering monsters are designed to 
	make the area more interesting for players looking for a more active hunting 
	experience.<br>
	<br>
	I will throw the idea of a longer respawn at the team and see what they 
	think.</font></p>

	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">They are specifically not undead so we can 
	populate the graveyard and the closer groups don't necessarily recognize the 
	agro &quot;screams&quot; of different groups. It has to do with how the graveyard is 
	layed out and how we want groups to agro each other.<br>
	<br>

		the comparatively small xp from the trophies, it should be able to be 
		shared in a fellowship, as it almost requires a fellowship to hunt 
		there.</i></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our current tech doesn't allow for this since 
	you can't do &quot;math&quot; in a script. I know that probably doesn't make much 
	sense but trust me that a script that tried to count items in that way would 
	be cumbersome and inefficient at best. We don't want a heavily used NPC to 
	have a long script that checks inventory over and over to &quot;count&quot; out items 
	and reward for each possible amount. It wouldn't be good for the server. On 
	the other hand, you don't have to single drag each shroud onto the NPC for 
	it's own XP reward! <br>
	<br>
	If there was a large player outcry for it we could probably add an option to 
	single drag shrouds onto the NPC for a partial reward. QA didn't feel that 
	it would be all that useful.<br>
	<br>
	As for trophy quests and fellowships, the trophy quests are fine tuned to 
	give maximum rewards to smaller groups. The graveyard is not balanced for a 
	full fellowship group, and they already get group XP bonus. A full 
	fellowship group has other areas they can also adventure in. The Colosseum 
	is an example of an area that is cool for a full fellowship. While nothing 
	prevents a full fellowship from hunting the graveyard, they already have a 
	substantial XP bonus for the group. The trophies are there to make the 
	graveyard even more lucrative for people who feel like hunting in smaller 
	groups since there isn't any other hunting spot that rewards that kind of 
	play.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello there and welcome to the Weekly update 
	for 4/2/07. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team continues to work on the April event. The balance on 
	things is being worked out and bugs are getting fixed. The team has also 
	begun the work of planning what will happen for the May event. Of course 
	this is only in the rough planning stages at this point, but we have a 
	general idea of what direction we will be going in for that month. <br>
	<br>
	It appears that most everyone got a kick out of our April Fools fun over the 
	weekend. If you haven’t had the chance yet, make sure you check out the 
	Tanada House of Pancakes, but watch out for those Pancake Golems, they can 
	be really sticky critters to handle. :P<br>
	<br>
	I have been really pleased with how civil everyone has been over the past 
	couple of weeks on the thread about our customer service. It is always nice 
	to have a discussion on how to improve things without resorting to flaming 
	or name calling. It is a tribute to how mature this community is\has become 
	over the last few years. As I said in the thread already, the feedback that 
	is gathered from that thread is going over to those in charge of our 
	Customer Service team, so the constructive criticism is welcome. <br>
	<br>
	Our friends in the great Pacific Northwest are having the bi monthly 
	Asheron’s Call dinner this month. I recommend that you go if you have the 
	chance. It is a good time. <br>
	From Gouru’s post:<br>
	We meet at the Azteca
	<a target="_blank" href="http://maps.live.com/?v=2&amp;sp=yp.YN925x15726177">
	http://maps.live.com/?v=2&amp;sp=yp.YN925x15726177</a> at 5 for happy hour and 
	at 6:30 for all ages invited Player Dinner. This is always a great time to 
	come out and meet fellow local area players! Prices are reasonable, and you 
	do NOT have to purchase dinner to attend.<br>
	<br>
	Bring a non-playing friend for a FREE boxed copy of Asheron’s Call and a one 
	month subscription.<br>
	<br>
	Hope to see you there! Please RSVP to
	<a href="mailto:johndilley52@hotmail.com">johndilley52@hotmail.com</a> so I 
	can let the restaurant know how many will be there.<br>
	<br>
	Last but not least, some of you have been PM’ing me about the resolution for 
	those people whose Colosseum keys were “eaten” by the chest. I apologize for 
	the delay on resolving this for those folks. Things have been exceptionally 
	busy for me in the last couple of weeks, and I let this keep sliding down my 
	to-do list. This week I will be taking care of it. I have the list of people 
	who PM’d me and have gathered all of the information I need. If you sent me 
	a PM about the matter when I asked, I would ask that you send me one more PM 
	with the best time to reach you in game. Once I have this time I will log in 
	and attempt reach all parties involved. I thank you all for your patience, 
	while waiting for a resolution to this matter.<br>

	<br>
	Simple answer:<br>
	<br>
	Because there was no such thing as an atlatl or sligshot when the composite 
	weapons were first created. We simply updated the existing items this time 
	around. It may be a good idea to make a &quot;composite&quot; atlatl or slignshot

	There are two issues with your test though, one I have mentioned (this

	that I have not mentioned, but players should be vaguely aware of.<br>
	<br>
	When we did our PvP rebalance just over a year ago now we made changes to 
	how much damage players took from certain imbued weapons and how this damage 
	was handled. Seeing that you're using a loot generated imbued weapon on a 
	human target you get an extra bonus to your damage. So it's not just that 
	you're using comparing a rending weapon to a non-rending weapon you're 
	comparing a rending weapon with an innate damage increase due to use against

	Yes, they're not great in comparison to fully tinkered weapons. However, the

	I am working on our first pass through chest tech - I am going to make it 
	possible to have chests with locks clear out and totally generate new loot 
	when they are closed and relock. Right now old loot persists and makes it 
	possible to fill the chest. Also if someone doesn't take anything at all the 
	next person will get the same treasure. This causes all sorts of unintuitive 
	problems for players.<br>
	<br>
	It also means that chests that lock and are marked to use this tech will 
	regenerate loot so you can't close the chest and let someone else pick up 
	the item - but I doubt anyone did that for chests that required keys anyway 
	since it would waste a key.<br>

	I'll run the idea of increasing the range of Harm spells to the team. Maybe 
	a x2 or even x3 range from what it is now. Django will welcome a chance to 
	&quot;test&quot; this by kicking my butt in PVP.<br>

	<p>Okay, after discussion here is the issue.<br>
	<br>
	The highest level harm type spell is, according to the spell file, ~36 
	meters, or 6 meters above the longest war spell. So it's not exactly short 
	range. That range scales with spell level, so the lower level spells have 
	shorter range.<br>
	<br>
	If we change this it becomes more and more possible for a mage to tab select 
	creatures in dungeons that can't reach them and Harm them to death. Sure it 
	would take a while, but with no risk. That's not good and we don't want to 
	add to that possibility by increasing the range.<br>
	<br>
	That means we would have to add to to PvP attacks only, which requires new 
	tech. What exactly is this for? Is it just a matter or finishing off fleeing 
	enemies in PvP?<br>
	<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Um, AC currently doesn't have a root effect,

	Anyway, if we ever gave PC mages a slow or root effect we would have to give 
	melees an escape option, and I am not prepared right now to try to add 
	kiting balance to AC. It wouldn't be used to prevent escape, but to prevent 
	engagement. Adding engagement effects and counter effects to AC would be

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The problem isn't the technical difficulty. I

	We have documentation for everything that's in game, everything in game

	created that has everything that's going to go into game, every line of 
	text, every number and stat, etc. That document is kept and updated for

	<br>
	So, we have documents and databases that keep track of everything that gets

	The only issue is, it's hard for anyone to remember everything we've put in

	<p>It turns out that the reason Harm type spells are shorter range is that 
	the range is not modified by the casting skill. Projectile spells are 
	generally set up with a range modifier based on casting skill. So while the 
	Harm spells do have a longer base range than projectiles, character skill 
	modifies projectile spell range until it reaches its max, which is radar 
	range.<br>
	<br>
	In discussing an increase to Harm type spells several issues came up.<br>
	<br>
	First, we discussed the reintroduction of the Harmbot. This is the UCM that 
	finds some dungeon corner where it can safely harm creatures on the other 
	side. While we don't want to encourage this behavior, we also believe that 
	you can probably make better XP per hour simply hunting creatures many 
	levels lower than you with minimal risk.<br>
	<br>
	Second, we discussed the effect of full radar range Harms when abused with 
	add ons. We don't particularly like the concept of hunting packs that go 
	into dungeons and simply spam Harms on hunters through walls using add ons 
	to target and coordinate strikes. Suddenly dying to a PK Harm group would 
	not be fun.<br>
	<br>
	Third, we discussed the fact that increased Harm range is really a caster 
	boost. Although many archers and fighters also use life magic, swapping to a 
	wand and switching stances to finish off a fleeing opponent would be 
	cumbersome at best. We are wary of adding to the power of casters in this 
	way without some kind of melee and archer answer. For melee we are less 
	concerned since sticky melee means that people are much less likely to 
	escape if they break into a run. Archers are more of a concern.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Our best options follow:<br>
	<br>
	- The easiest thing for us to do is simply add in a skill modifier to range. 
	For most top end PvPers this would hit the max radar range.<br>
	<br>
	- We could also add tech to create an &quot;Execute&quot; spell that was a longer 
	range Harm 7, but it only worked on someone who has less than 10% of their 
	Health, or maybe less than 40 points. This way coordinated strike teams 
	can't launch an opening salvo through walls.<br>
	<br>
	The second option would honestly detract from valuable development time 
	which is a slight disadvantage.<br>
	<br>
	We are considering one of these options as a playtest but we want player 
	feedback.<br>
	<br>
	#1. Do PvP players think that coordinated Harm spells are actually a viable 
	threat? Is it worth protecting against this?<br>
	<br>
	#2. Do PvP players think that this would unbalance things in favor of 
	casters?<br>
	<br>
	#3. Would an execute Life Magic spell as a reward from a quest, perhaps a 
	PvP oriented quest, solve your issues?<br>
