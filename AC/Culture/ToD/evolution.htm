	<p>
    Ardry felt like a fool. He was standing in his Uncle Aliester’s workshop, 
	dressed in a thick suit of padded cloth armor. His uncle circled around him, 
	tightening straps and sealing him in tight. The suit was made up of multiple 
	layers of thick cotton. Underneath he wore two full-body layers of silk, 
	which his uncle had insisted upon. It restricted his movement so much that 
	he could barely bend his arms and he could only move in a waddle. Worst of 
	all, he was sweltering in the early summer heat.<br>
	<br>
	“Tell me again what this suit is supposed to be for?” he asked.<br>
	<br>
	Aliester the Loquacious grinned absently as he fastened the last buckle. 
	“Oh, it’s to protect you, my boy. We’re testing something truly 
	revolutionary here. You’ll be remembered far and wide for your part in 
	scientific progress.”<br>
	<br>
	“I’d like to hope that I’d already be well-remembered for my part in 
	exploring every bloody inch of this island and leaving corpses all over most 
	of it…” Ardry groused, but his words fell on deaf or inattentive ears as his 
	uncle shuffled quickly into the next room.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry watched in anger and some trepidation as Aliester returned with a 
	steaming kettle and a thick paintbrush. He almost gagged when the smell hit 
	him – it smelled like blood and rot and a terrible, repulsive musk. His 
	uncle obviously found the smell unpleasant, too, because he’d returned with 
	a wet cloth mask strapped over his nose and mouth.<br>
	<br>
	“Pwyll’s bones, uncle! What is that awful smell?”<br>
	<br>
	“This?” Aliester’s voice was muffled by the mask. “Oh, this is chum, my boy. 
	Hold on a moment, I must be very precise when I apply it. Don’t want to get 
	any on the floor. Or on myself, for that matter! All your questions will be 
	answered in time, I promise.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry was confused, as he often was when trying to catch up with his uncle’s 
	wandering attention. The word “chum” meant nothing to him. He tried to ask 
	for clarification, but his uncle shushed him. “Please be still and be quiet, 
	my boy. You don’t want to get this on your bare flesh. It’s quite difficult 
	to wash off!”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry sighed and did his best to ignore the revolting odor as his uncle 
	liberally slopped the dark, foul-smelling muck onto the chest, arms, and 
	legs of the thick cloth armor he was wearing. He put three coats of the 
	pungent goop onto Ardry, taking care never to spill a drop on himself or on 
	the floor around him.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, just when Ardry was beginning to forget what anything smelled like 
	besides the awful chum, his uncle thought to wrap a wet cloth mask around 
	his nose and mouth so that he, too, might have some respite from the 
	overwhelming odor.<br>
	<br>
	Once that was done, Aliester the Loquacious stood back from his nephew with 
	a critical eye. “Hrm… Looks even… looks well secured… I think we’re ready 
	for our field test!” He smiled eagerly, and he had the gleam in his eye that 
	he got only when he was close to a true scientific breakthrough.<br>
	<br>
	“Let’s bring you outside for the field test, Ardry. Won’t have far to walk, 
	just twenty or thirty paces from the front door…”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester stepped into the other room for a moment and came back with a belt 
	pouch strapped to his waist. The sound of clinking bottles accompanied him 
	as he walked. He took his nephew by the wrist, making sure not to touch any 
	part that he’d smeared the chum onto.<br>
	<br>
	“Uncle, I have to ask,” Ardry said as he slowly shuffled along under his 
	uncle’s guidance. “What is this chum stuff made from? I’ve never smelled 
	such a thing.”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester smiled. “My own creation. Quite an ingenious recipe, if I do say so 
	myself. It’s made from mite blood, ground-up shreth livers, scent glands 
	from reedsharks… A lot of ingredients, actually. Very difficult to come by, 
	and doubly difficult to make in useful quantities. Now, here we are.”<br>
	<br>
	His uncle had steered him into a clearing among the trees, a stone’s throw 
	from the front door of his cabin. “Please stand here, Ardry. Stay still. 
	I’ll let you know when it’s okay to move.”<br>
	<br>
	With that, Aliester jogged back towards the cabin, stopping a few feet from 
	the door. He took a glass phial from his belt pouch and held it in his hand, 
	all the while staring intently at his nephew in the offal-smeared cloth 
	armor.<br>
	<br>
	“What is that in your hand, uncle?” Ardry’s tone was desperate with worry.<br>
	<br>
	Aliester brandished the phial and held it up in the air. “This is progress, 
	Ardry! No more will our most potent armor-reducing and vulnerability effects 
	be restricted to the hands of those who have mastered Life Magic! Because, 
	with my expert consultation, the council of sages has found out a way to 
	capture the essence of those magical effects in an alchemical mixture! You 
	will be the first to test out this revolutionary advance in Derethian 
	technology!” <br>
	<br>
	The old man began to wind his arm back like he was going to throw the phial 
	at Ardry. “All you have to do is break the phial on your target…”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry’s eyes went wide and he waved his arms as much as he could to stop his 
	uncle. “Uncle, wait! What’s this chum supposed to do? Your alchemical 
	formula’s not going to catch fire or something when it hits me, is it?”<br>
	<br>
	“Catch fire? Heavens no, my boy. The chum is not alchemically active like 
	the contents of this phial. No, it’s just there to attract reedsharks, you 
	see. Now please, hold still.”<br>
	<br>
	“Reedsharks?” Ardry spun, looking to see if any of the vicious finned 
	predators were on the way already. He could see the bushes rustling in the 
	distance. In the undergrowth not too far away, he thought he saw a fin. Then 
	another. And another.<br>
	<br>
	He felt an impact on his back and heard the soft tinkling sound of breaking 
	glass. A grey mist washed over him as the alchemical bomb broke on his back 
	and released its contents. He felt a familiar sinking sensation, the same 
	kind he was used to feeling when he’d been hit with the Imperil spell by a 
	hostile mage.<br>
	<br>
	“You moved!” his uncle called out, accusingly. “I asked you not to move, 
	Ardry! But no matter, I managed to hit you anyway, and now you can move as 
	much as you like…” <br>
	<br>
	Ardry wasn’t paying attention. All he could hear was the throaty rumbling 
	bark of reedsharks on the hunt and closing fast.</p>

	<p>Adso crouched behind a boulder and watched the drudge scamper into the 
	woods. In a small notebook, he noted the time of its passage and what he 
	could observe of its equipment. Ever since the drudges had established their 
	unusually organized assault on Cragstone, he’d been scouting the area to see 
	what was really going on. His Master had guessed, correctly, that there was 
	more going on with the siege than just a bunch of overambitious drudges 
	looting as much as they could from the Aluvian capital town.<br>
	<br>
	It had not taken Adso and his fellow acolytes long to find the trail of 
	drudge couriers bringing sacks full of supplies to a mysterious location in 
	the northern woods. Adso’s responsibility was to maintain the watch on the 
	drudges leaving Cragstone. If he’d had his way, he would have been the one 
	tasked to follow the drudges down whatever hole they were scuttling into, to 
	see where all those supplies were going. Instead that task had been given to 
	Sabithra, one of the bolder junior acolytes, the “Younger Sister” whose 
	early training had once been Adso’s responsibility.<br>
	<br>
	He sighed in frustration. He didn’t trust Sabithra to scout underground yet. 
	She was too unpredictable and too eager to fight. She had not yet 
	internalized the notion that sometimes a quiet retreat was better than a 
	kill. Obviously their Master disagreed with his opinion of Sabithra’s 
	discipline, and Adso consciously stopped that train of thought before he 
	could spend too much more time questioning Master’s judgment.<br>
	<br>
	Adso was so lost in his internal debate that he almost failed to notice the 
	very faint crackle of a dry leaf in the undergrowth behind him. He flattened 
	himself against the ground, put one hand on the hilt of his sword, and 
	slowly turned his head to see who, or what, was stalking behind him. To his 
	relief, he saw Sabithra, trying unsuccessfully to sneak up on him. She 
	shrugged insouciantly at him, apparently unashamed of her attempt to sneak 
	up on him and unbothered by her failure to do so. He shook his head, angered 
	by her presence and by her cavalier attitude to her duties. Wasn’t she 
	supposed to be in the drudge’s dungeon, investigating the end of their 
	apparent supply chain? <br>
	<br>
	He glared at her as she came closer. Finally, when she was in whispering 
	distance, he said, “I thought you were at the other end of this trail, 
	scouting underground.”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra grimaced and shook her head. “I got caught.”<br>
	<br>
	Adso sneered, bitterly pleased that he’d failed in her assignment. “By who? 
	Or by what?”<br>
	<br>
	She shrugged, and again Adso found the gesture infuriating. “Something large 
	and angry. Big enough to flatten me in one hit. I didn’t get a good look at 
	it before it squashed me. I was just making my way through some huge, dark 
	chamber in the compound where the drudges were bringing their supplies, and 
	then there was this incredibly loud roar behind me… Next thing I knew, I was 
	at the lifestone, with Master chuckling at me.”<br>
	<br>
	“What did Master say?”<br>
	<br>
	“He took my report, short as it was, laughed and said something like 
	‘teemon’ to me, and then gave me this note and told me to bring it to you.” 
	As she spoke, she drew a thin roll of parchment from her belt pouch. It was 
	still tied and sealed with the plain black seal that Master favored.<br>
	<br>
	Adso frowned. He knew what “teemon” meant, even if Sabithra was too young or 
	too unschooled in the lore of humanity’s early days on Dereth. He knew then 
	that these drudges were involved in something truly dangerous and wondered 
	if his Master was planning to get involved in a suddenly more complicated 
	and more dangerous situation.<br>
	<br>
	He took the note from Sabithra, broke the seal, and read it. When he 
	finished reading, he laughed softly and shook his head.<br>
	<br>
	“Well? What is it?” Sabithra asked. Adso noted the impatience bordering on 
	insolence in her tone. He’d have to speak to Master about her later. For 
	now, he only smiled enigmatically, trying his best to approximate their 
	Master’s own inscrutable smile. He put away the notebook he’d been using to 
	record the movements of the drudges. He swallowed the note from Master, as 
	he’d been taught to do.<br>
	<br>
	Wordlessly, he stood, abandoning his stealthy perch, and started the trek to 
	Cragstone. As he walked, Sabithra followed, dogging his heels like a pet 
	hungry for attention.<br>
	<br>
	“Come on, what did the note say?”<br>
	<br>
	Adso decided to stop being coy. “All the acolytes are being called back 
	home. We’re to gather and go into the Colosseum together. It seems there’s a 
	new champion there, some kind of elder from that new Tanada clan. He calls 
	himself ‘The Master’ and our own Master wishes for all of us acolytes to 
	test him.” He did not vocalize his suspicion that Master was more interested 
	in testing his own acolytes than he was in testing the powers of some old 
	Tanada. He felt sure that Sabithra could benefit greatly from having her 
	throat slit by a true master assassin. That is, if she had the wits to learn 
	from defeat.<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra stopped walking. She stared at him in shock, and he found himself 
	enjoying her discomfort. “We’re going into the Colosseum to fight an elder 
	of the Tanada clan because Master wants to see who the most masterful Master 
	is?”<br>
	<br>
	Adso walked back to stand right in front of her. He got up close and stood 
	toe-to-toe with her, which he hadn’t done since her earliest training 
	sessions. He looked into her eyes and tried to summon up the force of his 
	will to intimidate her, just as he’d learned from their Master. “Yes we are. 
	Master has commanded this of us, and we will do as he says. Do you have a 
	problem, Younger Sister Sabithra?”<br>
	<br>
	She smiled wickedly and stared right back into his eyes. “Not at all, Elder 
	Brother Adso. It sounds like fun. I can’t wait to fight a master assassin 
	right at your side.” That said, she started walking again, but with a very 
	pronounced spring in her step.</p>

	June 18, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the Release Notes for the June event, 
	Evolution. There have been many strange things happening around Dereth 
	lately and this month is no different. The Monouga’s have been showing up 
	more and more lately, and those darn Drudges seem to be gathering with a 
	purpose. What creatures could be next? We have also seen some changes that 
	favor those learned in the skill of Alchemy. Those folks never cease to 
	amaze us. Let’s see what else is new and exciting this month in Dereth!<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Alchemy Grenades are being introduced this month. Alchemists meeting 
		the requirements will be able to craft and use these new grenades to aid 
		in hunting. As of right now these new grenades will offer a way for 
		those trained in the art of Alchemy the ability to debuff creatures with 
		spells like Imperil and damage type debuffs. There will be some cost 
		associated with creating these new grenades based on the power of the 
		grenade the person is trying to craft. In addition, once the grenades 
		are wielded they will grant the user a substantial bonus to their thrown 
		weapon skill. To learn more about these new found skill, players are 
		encouraged to travel to Xarabydun.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Colosseum boss fights have been added this month! Players who have 
		achieved certain goals in the Colosseum will be able to enter these 
		fights for fame and fortune! Ok well maybe not fame and fortune, but 
		there will certainly be some nice rewards including bragging rights for 
		completing certain tasks in the Colosseum. Players may enter these 
		fights by using the proper Champion Statue in the main hallway of the 
		Colosseum staging area.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Saving Asheron boss fights have been updated, the phases should 
		now run in a more user friendly order. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Jarvis Hammerstone would overwrite the Drudge kill task if a player 
		took more than fourteen days to complete it. This has been fixed and he 
		will no longer overwrite the task.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Spectral Arrows, Bolts and Atlatl Darts now have a burden of 1 per 
		piece. They previously had no burden.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Spectral Bolts and Darts now show their proper name, instead of 
		all being called arrows.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The pickup timer on the Pages of Salt and Ash has been reduced to 24 
		hours.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A bug that was causing the Salvaging Forges in the towns to not work 
		has been fixed and they should now work properly.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Players will now be informed of what and how many items are taken 
		from them when an NPC uses a take item command.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Monsters/NPCs are now able to cast spells on themselves in response 
		to player actions (critical hit, upon hitting a specific level of 
		health, on resisting a spell, etc.) so be careful!<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You may now ivory your Baby Bunny Booty orb<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Plan (Drudge Painting) is now a wall hookable item instead of a 
		floor hookable item.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Ulgrim, in a drunken haze, sometimes thought he’d given a Mystical 
		Mug to players he hadn’t. His memory has cleared a bit and he should now 
		remember who he has and hasn’t given a Mystical Mug to from now on. If 
		you should have received a Mystical Mug and didn’t in the past he’ll 
		still not give you one, please contact in game support about this issue.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Due to issues in Drudge mass production methods Drudge Balloons are 
		no longer as sturdy or maneuverable as they once were. They’re now 
		easier to hit with Magic and Missile weapons and have less health.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Farmer Kao is no longer certain that he wants his chewed up shovel, 
		so he’ll ask you if you want to keep it… maybe someone else can make use 
		of it.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You are now able to gain access to the portal in the Drudge Fort 
		outside of Cragstone, it’s time to take it to the Drudges!</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Game Discussion</b><br>
	<br>
	We would like to take this opportunity to discuss a new Live Event feature 
	that was brought up not too long ago. During a large portion of our Live 
	Events the person running the event will place a large number of rewards on 
	the ground. In theory, if everyone was nice, this would not be an issue and 
	everyone would happily pick up their reward and move on. We of course know 
	this is not the case and sometimes certain people will try to pick up as 
	many as they can with no regard for others. This leads to bad feelings for 
	most involved and may even discourage some from participating in these 
	events in the future. <br>
	<br>
	The idea we have proposed is for live event rewards to become tokens. 
	Depending on the event, the person running the event would place these 
	tokens on the ground for players to pick up just as events were done before. 
	The change this time would be the tokens will have a timer on being picked 
	up. That means each player would get one reward per event instead of a few 
	fast players hoarding as many as they can pick up. This way we can ensure 
	that everyone gets a reward and the greedy people do not get more than they 
	should. Once players have their tokens they would then go to a special NPC 
	and use the token as currency to buy one of the many rewards that NPC would 
	have on them. We feel this will help out everyone in the long run and make 
	the live event experience more enjoyable for all those involved.<br>
	<br>
	This is still in the loose development stage right now, but we think this is 
	definitely a step in the right direction. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	June and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	June event.</p>
