    The lonely lord sat in his private sanctum, staring blankly into the runes 
	he had just inscribed into his heavy, leatherbound journal. He idly tapped 
	his fingers on the top of his desk, and the only sound audible over the 
	click of bone against chalcedony was the soft, keening whine, the sound of a 
	soul in torment, from the altar behind him.<br>
	<br>
	From the back of the study, interrupting the lord’s solitude, came the sound 
	of bootsteps in the empty corridor. He did not have to look to know that one 
	of the household servants in charge of maintaining this library complex had 
	come to his study.<br>
	<br>
	“Speak, majordomo,” he said, not bothering to turn around. “What is it you 
	would have of me?”<br>
	<br>
	“My lord,” the servant rasped through a ruined throat, “the archivists are 
	almost done with packing the most precious texts. The guards grow nervous as 
	these… disturbances continue. It is almost time to leave, my lord. All that 
	remains is… your part.”<br>
	<br>
	The clicking of fingers on writing surface stopped as the lord closed the 
	book in front of him. The majordomo stepped closer, making sure to keep a 
	safe distance from the garishly lit altar between him and his master.<br>
	<br>
	“Shall I take that journal for you, my lord? There is room yet, not all of 
	the boxes have been sealed for transport back to His Majesty’s court. There 
	is still time…”<br>
	<br>
	The lord laughed, grim and bitter. “Time is one thing we do not lack, 
	majordomo. It will be thousands of years before these halls are disturbed 
	again, if my dreams are true.”<br>
	<br>
	“As you say, my lord.”<br>
	<br>
	The lord stood, pushing his chair out, and he looked down upon the sealed 
	journal. For a long moment, he remained still. The majordomo took one 
	nervous step closer. “My lord? Your journal? And the… other book?” As if to 
	underscore his urgency, a dull, rumbling boom rolled through the chamber 
	again. Dust sifted from the stonework above and trickled onto the desk and 
	the floor nearby.<br>
	<br>
	The lord hissed and swept the book off the desk with one angry motion. The 
	book fell to the ground with a loud thump, and reflexively, the servant 
	rushed to pick it up.<br>
	<br>
	“No.” The lord’s voice echoed, even louder than the sounds of crumbling 
	stone that surrounded them. “Leave it be. I am done with it. Tell the 
	archivists to be on their way. I shall follow in a few moments. With the 
	other book.”<br>
	<br>
	The servant retreated, scuttling backwards out of the room, bowing abjectly 
	every few steps. The lord suddenly spun to look at him and called out.<br>
	<br>
	“Wait. Where is my seal?”<br>
	<br>
	The servant bowed again, afraid to meet his master’s eyes. “My lord, I do 
	not know. I thought you had it. I do not come in here myself, as you know, 
	except in this case, when I had to tell my lord—“<br>
	<br>
	“I know why you came here, majordomo. Very well. That will be all. Go, tell 
	the archivists.”<br>
	<br>
	“As you say, my lord.” The majordomo fairly flew out of the room in his 
	eagerness to escape his master’s strange temper and the pulsing book on the 
	altar at the center of the room.<br>
	<br>
	The lord looked around the study once more. He looked at the half-emptied 
	bookshelves, ransacked for all irreplaceable items. He looked at the fallen 
	journal on the floor at his feet. He looked at the altar at the center of 
	the room, the vessel of his greatest triumph and deepest despair. “Would 
	that you had been here, my lady, perhaps I would have thought better of it,” 
	he muttered, to no one in particular.<br>
	<br>
	He shook his head and then straightened up, with an audible creak of dusty 
	bones. He walked toward the altar in the middle of the room and the book 
	that sat upon it, which bathed everything nearby in a ghastly red glow.<br>
	<br>
	He stopped in front of the altar and reached out slowly, almost hesitantly, 
	to touch the book. This book was larger and heavier than the journal he’d 
	been keeping, and the binding sickened even one as inured to horror as he 
	was. As he drew close, he could hear sibilant whispering in his mind. Down 
	the corridor there were the sounds of running feet and shouted commands as 
	his minions finished their preparations to abandon his library. Another 
	rumbling roar echoed through the halls. It sounded like the very masonry was 
	coming apart.<br>
	<br>
	The lord addressed the book itself as he took hold of it with both hands. 
	“If it were my decision, I would leave you here and hope these halls remain 
	sealed forever. But I know that will not be true, that this library and that 
	accursed graveyard will come forth again some day. And perhaps the only 
	chance to reverse the damage done is somewhere else within your 
	thrice-damned pages. Very well. Come on, you vile thing. My master awaits.”<br>
	<br>
	The whispers built to a crescendo in his head as he tried to lift the book 
	from the altar. There was a moment of resistance, as if he had been encased 
	in unyielding stone, before the book came free from the altar. The lord 
	shook his head and snarled as he tucked the book unceremoniously under one 
	arm like a novice in his own academy. “Never should I have agreed to use 
	you. The Mhoires were not worth this. I have made too many bad bargains.”<br>
	<br>
	The book shivered briefly with malevolent humor. Ignoring it, the lord held 
	his hand over the altar and spoke a few words in another language, a 
	language even more ancient than his own. The altar shimmered as his warding 
	spell settled over it. He stood there for a few moments more, probing at the 
	ward with his own keenly attuned magical senses. The ward was incomplete. 
	Flawed. It seemed that the consequences of his meddling had affected even 
	his own casting abilities in this place.<br>
	<br>
	Shaking his head, Lord Rytheran strode out of his study and ritual chamber 
	for the last time, accompanied by the ominous rumble of shifting rock and 
	barely audible laughter.<br>

	<p>Adso crawled across the rubble-strewn field on his belly. He moved 
	slowly, almost torturously. Each limb moved at a glacial pace: undetectable 
	on first or even second glance, but he managed to cover significant 
	distances that he would otherwise have been unable to move across without 
	alerting the creatures in the area. It took a prodigious amount of muscle 
	control and discipline to move this way, but he had been well trained by his 
	master in all manner of infiltration techniques. A human observer would have 
	found him near impossible to detect, even if it had not been a moonless 
	night under the dark pall of the graveyard. The supernatural creatures were 
	harder to fool, but even so he had managed to evade detection by using every 
	bit of his tradecraft and he was within a few paces of his goal.<br>
	<br>
	Finally he managed to creep in under the cover of a pile of rubble near a 
	low stretch of broken wall. It was enough cover for him to move at a normal 
	pace as long as he stayed hunched over. Around the corner of the wall was a 
	crypt he needed to search, and he was close… so close...<br>
	<br>
	He was so close he momentarily lost focus, and forgot to keep track of where 
	he was stepping. As he edged around the corner his foot brushed against 
	something heavy, hairy, and warm. It was the merest touch, but it was 
	enough. Adso looked down, cursing silently, as he heard the first warning 
	chitter from the grave rat whose nap he’d just interrupted. A half-gnawed 
	human arm nearby was evidence of what had happened to the last person to run 
	afoul of the beast.<br>
	<br>
	Small, glowing eyes snapped open and the creature began to hiss. With his 
	quick hands, Adso managed to draw his blade and jab it into the rat’s skull 
	before it could attack or spit acid or scream. The rat died with a strangled 
	gurgling noise. An alert glance showed that there were no other rats near 
	enough to notice. He whispered a prayer of thanks to whatever deity would 
	listen, then got back to work. In a smooth motion, he set the heavy, 
	stinking corpse down on the ground behind the wall, withdrew his weapon, and 
	cleaned the blade on the beast’s mangy fur.<br>
	<br>
	A few steps later, he slipped into the doorway of a dark and seemingly empty 
	crypt. He stuck close to the wall and made his way around to the back of the 
	crypt, where he could barely make out the outlines of some kind of chest or 
	container. As he got closer, he was able to confirm that the object was, in 
	fact, a chest. His pulse quickened. It was here, just as he’d been told…<br>
	<br>
	Adso glanced back at the entrance to the crypt again and swept his eyes over 
	the entire interior. Still no sign of other creatures in here. Breathing 
	deeply to calm himself, he knelt before the chest and probed around it with 
	fingers and picks to search for traps. <br>
	<br>
	In a few moments he’d satisfied himself that there were no traps and that 
	the chest was unlocked. Praying for more luck, he grasped the edges of the 
	lid and began to lift ever so slowly. With just a crack of opening, his 
	keenly trained eyes were already able to make out the glint of gold. Surely 
	this was the seal he’d been sent to find…<br>
	<br>
	A scratching noise behind him froze him in place, with his fingers still 
	under the lid of the chest. He looked around to the entrance. Another grave 
	rat had crawled into this crypt and was making its way down the stairs. It 
	didn’t seem to have noticed him yet, but if he stayed where he was, or tried 
	to open the chest to fetch the seal, he’d almost certainly be spotted. Very 
	carefully, he began to lower the lid again, keeping one eye trained on the 
	rat and its maddeningly casual progress into the crypt. He’d have to sneak 
	up on the rat and kill it before it could alert any of its kin, just like 
	the last one.<br>
	<br>
	As he lowered the lid smoothly into place again, a shadow darkened the 
	entrance of the crypt. It was a man-sized shadow, but with an odd 
	silhouette… As if it were wearing some kind of strangely shaped helmet. 
	Quite heedless of the danger, the intruder seemed to dance down the steps. 
	The rat spun to look at it and hissed, and was met with more giggling and 
	dancing. The stranger leaped from the middle of the steps and landed 
	gracefully on his tip-toes, then spun a complete circle and finished with a 
	flourishing bow, right in front of the angry rat.<br>
	<br>
	As Adso watched in horrified fascination, the rat leaped up at the stranger, 
	shrieking with rage. The stranger caught it with strong hands and cradled it 
	against his chest. Its screams and squeals echoed deafeningly in Adso’s 
	ears, and he knew that in a few moments this crypt would be filled with 
	other rats drawn by the screams. The rat continued to thrash and even let 
	loose a stream of acid, at which point the stranger performed a strangely 
	beautiful pirouette, redirecting the stream of acid to splash on the wall 
	near Adso.<br>
	<br>
	Adso ducked and covered as the acid splashed near him. He rolled away from 
	the chest, determined to escape this crypt before he was trapped in it, and 
	try to re-approach later. When he looked up, the stranger was standing right 
	in front of him. The rat continued to thrash in his arms, but it wasn’t 
	making any noise now that the stranger had clamped a hand on the underside 
	of its head and throat. With one slow, sickening turn of his hand, the 
	stranger crushed the rat’s throat. Drops of blood and bile dripped onto the 
	floor as the rat’s life slowly drained out of it.<br>
	<br>
	The stranger giggled again and tossed the dead rat aside. Adso could only 
	stare up at this thing in fascination. He was dressed in checked black and 
	white, his face was painted like some garish marionette… And his eyes glowed 
	with the light of pure madness. Still laughing, the stranger slapped his 
	hand, still slimy with rat drool and gore, over Adso’s forehead.<br>
	<br>
	“Here for my secret stolen treasure, are you? Someone’s been telling tales 
	out of the academy again!” The stranger’s voice was high and cracking, and 
	spoken with a strange inflection.<br>
	<br>
	Unable to think of a response, Adso tried to pull away, but he couldn’t. He 
	felt a burning pain on his forehead, a pain that seemed to be growing by the 
	second. His eyes rolled back into his head as the pain became unbearable. He 
	thought he would go mad from the agony when, abruptly, the pain stopped. 
	Adso opened his eyes and found himself alone with the chest and the dead 
	rat. The stranger in motley had vanished…<br>
	<br>
	A voice echoed above him. “Broken vows and treacherous hearts! The withered 
	lord flees his broken arts! They come seeking for the lordly seal, but they 
	know not what the seal reveals! Now run, little man, run to master. The fool 
	has come to cry disaster!”<br>
	<br>
	As more insane laughter rang out through the crypt, Adso saw the roiling 
	silhouette of a horde of rats that had appeared at the entrance, drawn by 
	the death squeals of the stranger’s victim.<br>
	<br>
	“By the way, pal, watch out for the rats,” the disembodied voice echoed once 
	more, as the swarm of rats surged forward.</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=571">Turbine Site</a>, 
	March 22, 2008</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the March Release Notes! With the defeat of 
	Aerbax, there is a feeling of hope in the air. Could it be a coincidence 
	that spring has arrived early? <br>
	<br>
	Let’s see what else is going on in Asheron’s Call for the month of March.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Aerbax Fight Changes</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Emissary of Asheron is now friendlier to players who have 
		defeated Aerbax. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Some new items have been added to the rewards for defeating Aerbax. 
		Players may want to run this quest again, and see what they might get.
		<br>
		A typo in Aerbax’s intro dialog has been fixed. He now knows how to 
		spell his own name. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Players should not be able to stay on Aerbax’s platform after 
		defeating him. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Aerbax should no longer be having the issue which caused him to pop 
		back to full health. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Due to the change that was needed to make sure Aerbax did not pop 
		back to full health, we have raised his overall health level to ensure 
		the fight remains challenging to players. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Emissary of Asheron should now give time estimates to players 
		waiting for another group to finish the Aerbax quest.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>There is now a shortcut to the portal device for players, so there 
		is no longer a need to make the long run after each death during the 
		Aerbax fight. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Miscellaneous Changes </b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Spear of Purity has had its attack modifier raised to 15% and 
		its defense modifier raised to 10%.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Chorizite pea now splits into Chorizite powder instead of oil.
		<br>
		Asheron’s Servant now accepts the Charged Shards.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Gladiator's Defense Armor Augments description has been changed 
		to, raises bludgeon resistance by .2 (since that's what it does). Its 
		cost has been lowered to 15 coins.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Chorizite pea from Trial of the Heart now states it can't be 
		split (it never could be and confused some people).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Gem of Spectral Force's description now states melee weapons 
		only.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Scepter of Might now has a 18% attack mod and a 7% defense mod.<br>
		The Spectral Crystal of the Life Giver now has a life magic icon instead 
		of war.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Winter is over in Dereth and spring is upon us. The snow has melted 
		away and once again the baby creatures of Dereth roam the landscape. <br>
		There have been reports that some kind of strange statue has appeared 
		near the Mage Academy. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>As we approach the beginning of April, make sure you are on the 
		lookout for some “foolish” activities. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Magic Defense Weapon Augmentation gem now works on wands. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Sword of Soroku has had its multi strike removed, and should now 
		have a wield requirement. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Spellbook interface has been reorganized in preparation for 
		level 8 spells. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Quest Experience Updates</b><br>
	We have changed or raised the experience that player can receive on some of 
	our older quests this month. Many of our older quests gave a flat rate or no 
	xp at all for completion. We have begun the process of adjusting some of 
	these quests to be more in line with the rewards we are now giving out for 
	quest completion. Below is a list of the quests that have been adjusted for 
	the month of March. If the xp mechanics have changed in any way, it will be 
	detailed below. Please note that at no point should the rewards player get 
	be lessened by these changes. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Aerlinthe: No change to mechanics, players will now receive a 
		percentage based reward for completion.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Gaerlan: Players will now receive a percentage based xp reward for 
		completing the quest, as well as the xp for turning in the sword. <br>
		Impious Staff: Players will now receive a percentage based xp reward 
		along with the staff upon completion of the quest. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Crystal Array Core: Players will now receive a percentage based xp 
		reward for turning in Soul Gems to the same NPC’s who hand out the 
		weapons upon completion of the quests. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call 
	in March. Please remember that along with everything listed here, there are 
	several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the March 
	event.<br>
