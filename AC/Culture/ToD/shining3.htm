	</font></font>
	<p align="left">Hi Maggie, love the site and all.<br>
	<br>
	I was playing my new level 13 character on Solclaim (April 17th) when this 
	message came up:<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">The townsfolk of Stonehold cry for assistance! The 
	town is under attack by Commander Jared Kurth and a detachment of Viamontian 
	Knights!</font><br>
	<br>
	Some people on the server thought the event would be in Holtburg or Shoushi 
	or Glenden Wood because of the past events, but was this a surprise!<br>
	<br>
	When the message appeared, people darted towards Stonehold, and most of them 
	died, most got away, or are still fighting while I type this.<br>
	<br>
	If you were on the server at the time, you would of been annoyed by the 
	general chat, people were screaming, praying not to die, and trying not to 
	die.<br>
	<br>
	I think this was a good &quot;Live Event&quot; for Asheron's Call, because it shows 
	that Asheron's Call is not dead yet, and will fortunately, never be. There 
	weren't many people on at the time, and one guy actually said in general 
	chat by the means of, &quot;Ok devs you guys win this one!&quot; which made me laugh 
	in real life. I unfortunately had to log after 18 minutes from the event 
	start, so people are still recovering bodies and trying to save Stonehold so 
	it does not turn into a Arwic or Yanshi before they were rebuilt.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you for your time in reading this.<br>

	<p align="center">**********<p>Hiya Maggie,<br>
	Hope you and the baby are doing well. Today (April 28th) around 10:00PM EST 
	on Solclaim an announcement went out that Stonehold was under attack.<br>
	We had so many people there, the lag locked up almost everyone. (Myself 
	included). Commander Jared Kurth showed up and he killed literally almost 
	everyone there at least once. He was hard to bring down, as even fully 
	debuffed I was only hitting him for 10-15d amage with a lightning rend 
	sword. Not to mention he'd kill you in 3-4swings! Oo<br>
	<br>
	We had a good number of Red PK's there, which has been ages since I've seen 
	Red PK's on Solclaim, as well as some Pklite players. Was good<br>
	to see Red dots are not completely dead on white worlds.<br>
	<br>
	As the battle went on, I decided to break the tension with some good ol' 
	humor. Kurth even responded, which in turn made everyone laugh. Here's a log 
	of some of the things that went on:<blockquote>
		<p>You say, &quot;Kurth just needs a hug. What's amatter big mutant guy, did 
		Vaccii kick your pet drudgey?&quot;<br>
		<font color="#D6D2DD">Theknight hugs kurth<br>
		You put your hands out, &quot;Whoa there!&quot;<br>
		</font>You say, &quot;your making a mess again, bad kurth, bad! No cookies 
		for you&quot;</blockquote>
	<p>It then turned abit more serious, as people tried to make a gameplan to 
	bring him down, some even started to heal him, and then Kurth mocked us!<blockquote>
		<p>Tyrannus says, &quot;quit healin him&quot;<br>
		Excalibur mage says, &quot;ok all go back to tower he will come over there 
		try to get him stuck again&quot;<br>
		Commander Jared Kurth says, &quot;Har! Har! Grar!&quot;<br>
		Niobe says, &quot;LOL&quot;<br>
		Commander Jared Kurth tears Himura the Mage to ribbons!</blockquote>
	<p>But then it was back to making some more humor with some dancing. I 
	decided I'd see if I could get kurth to stop fighting by dancing.<blockquote>
		<p><font color="#D6D2DD">You dance, &quot;Look at me! I'm dancin crazy!&quot;</font></blockquote>
	<p>But he did not like that idea to much and killed me after awhile. He did 
	laugh to i'm sure of it, as he just stood there for awhile jumping in front 
	of me. =D<blockquote>
		<p>Commander Jared Kurth says, &quot;Grarrrr! No Dance!&quot;<br>
		Niobe says, &quot;lol&quot;<br>
		Defiance says, &quot;LOL&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;Haha&quot;<br>
		0Krsna's Maya says, &quot;LOL&quot;<br>
		<font color="#D6D2DD">Defiance dances, &quot;Look at me! I'm dancin crazy!&quot;<br>
		</font>Niobe says, &quot;so kill those dancing :P&quot;<br>
		Niobe says, &quot;ya galoot&quot;</blockquote>
	<p>I decided to use my secret weapon on him after the dancing did not work. 
	So out came the Torch!<blockquote>
		<p>You say, &quot;take THIS Kurth!&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;Fire Bad!&quot;<br>
		Commander Jared Kurth says, &quot;GRAAAAAAARRRRR!!!!!!&quot;</blockquote>
	<p>At the end Himura the Mage got the kill on Kurth and then afterwards 
	Count Dardante showed up. Some swore an oath to Varicci, others to Elyasa 
	and still others to nobody. I told the Count I'd like to be portaled into 
	the stratosphere and fly Air Varicci so I could plummet to my bloodless 
	death, to which he snickered and laughed. He then handed me 3 propoganda 
	notes, and continued to trash talk us and call the Queen weak.<br>
	<br>
	When he disappeared, we had spawns of Eidolon Ghosts show up and we stomped 
	on them for awhile. After they where all defeated, propaganda started 
	falling from the sky. I asked if the Envoy could do a mass teleportation of 
	a group of us for skydiving.<br>
	<br>
	After awhile everyone teleported away. Envoy Speed came by and offered to 
	let me sky dive some. Included are some pics from the long long fall over 
	Teth.<br>
	<br>
	Overall I had a blast with this live event, and can't wait for the next one. 
	The Count said Kurth would return even stronger next time, which means this 
	next battle is going to be even more of a fight then this one. A lot of 
	people had crazy amounts of vitae, 20% 30% 35% 40% (I had 35%). It was an 
	all out war against Kurth and was a serious challenge, I mean just look at 
	all the bodies littering the screenshot there. <br>
	<br>
	Things are getting very interesting and I look forward to more of these 
	events to continue the storyline.<br>
	<br>
	Regards,<br>
	TheKnight of SC<br>

	<p>Hiya again Maggie, hope you and the baby are well.<br>
	<br>
	Today on 05/01/2006 at 6:00PM EST we had a global go out once again. Al-Jalima 
	was under attack by Commander Kurth. However, things went differently today 
	than yesterday. First we had a lot more Pro-Varicci (King) people healing 
	Kurth (myself included), and Kurth was much much stronger then before from 
	yesterday's live event. Before he was level 512 and now he was 647! He'd 
	kill people in two swings; that sword he uses is very powerful.<br>

	<p>There was more dancing as yesterday, and I even offered Kurth Stout to 
	quench his thrist. Kurth, however, was attacking both attackers and healers 
	alike. He seemed to be out of control and later we found out that he was 
	becoming harder to control from the Count directly. The battle lasted about 
	45 minutes with Kurth not being defeated, disappearing and then Count 
	Dardante showing up. The following people supported Varicci The Viamont 
	King:<br>
	Paraduck, JellyBelly, SellYourSoul, Gabs, Dark Entropy, Jothany, Realm of 
	Darkness, Country Evil, Budding Bower, and Myself.<br>
	<br>
	10 of us above all kneeled to the Count and the Count asked whoever was 
	Loyal to the King to speak up. After we did, those who supported The King 
	where teleported to the Rossa Morta Chapterhouse. The Count talked to us and 
	was pleased to see the number of followers for the King growing. Below I've 
	included a log of the event and various screenshots. <br>
	<br>
	After the private conversation with the Count, people on general started to 
	yell for whole allegiances to break apart for anyone that supported 
	Varicci's side. It was a sight to see indeed. I've personally not seen this 
	much passion for a storyline since the BZ and Martine days and it is good to 
	see people getting involved in the storylines once more, whichever side they 
	chose to be a part of. <br>
	<br>

	<p><b><a name="5"></a>Adso Meets with the Whispering Blade</b><p>Niobe of SC 
	sends the following report: &quot;Defiance and I were the only two people to show 
	up after Kurth was killed in Ziakhal. Dardante showed up and told people 
	that he went to the Whispering Blade Chatperhouse. Here is what Adso had to 
	say:&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Greetings.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;Greetings.&quot;<br>
	Defiance says,&quot;Hello. Thank you for the help.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;We need information.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I was less help that I would have liked, although I'm glad that 
	you took advantage of their distraction to hurt Kurth.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;How can it hurt him? He gets stronger with each death.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;What information do you need? I'll try to help, although I can't 
	swear for certain that I'll be able to tell you.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Tactics.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;You must use wise tactics to win. And muster more effectively.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I've begun to realize that perhaps those loyal to the Blade are 
	disheartened.&quot;<br>
	Defiance says,&quot;As did I.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I saw times when there were not enough people to muster an 
	attack.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I'm worried...you fought valiantly, but I don't know if it's 
	enough.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;It's not.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Then gather more. Make sure people realize that the Whispering 
	Blade aren't sworn to Elysa, but are simply in opposition to Varicci.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I've been trying.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I've been giving as many pep talks as I can.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I've been doing everything I can to stop other's faith from 
	faltering as well.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;It seems there's been great anger in the land against Elysa. I 
	don't care about royal blood one way or the other, but...well, we're not 
	exactly a legal organization ourselves.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Make sure to point out the dark arts that Dardante dabbles in. I 
	get the feeling not everyone knows about the spirits he enslaves, or the 
	other experiments.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Try to bring as many over as you can.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;Our variccie supporters spread slander about Elysa.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I disprove them.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;That's the thing. Make sure people realize this war's not about 
	Elysa.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Don't get caught in playing their game of comparison.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I don't.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Elysa is weak. Otherwise the Whispering Blade wouldn't need to 
	exist.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Maybe it's indecision. Certainly the one time in this war she has 
	become decisive, it turned out poorly.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;Is Asheron still in hiding?&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I don't know what's happened to Asheron.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I suspect we cannot rely on him, wherever he is.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	*Adso mentioned something about the Black Knight and something about himself 
	working for him, unfortunately, I missed logging that part*<br>
	<br>
	You say,&quot;Who is the Black Knight?&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;The Black Knight is the commander of the Whispering Blade.&quot;<br>
	Defiance says,&quot;We will do our best to rally those who would support the 
	Whispering Blade's fight against Varicci.&quot;<br>
	You say,&quot;I will do my best to keep loyalties with Elysa.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso says,&quot;The Rossu Morta have organized, and this, in part is what makes 
	Kurth so hard to defeat.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;I noticed.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;I've been fighting against Kurth with each planned attack.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;The only counter for organization is organization.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Also, you may want to brainstorm new approaches to your attack. 
	You won this time, I understand - your new tactics may be a good approach.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Do you have any more questions or requests of me?&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I have lost some vitae, so I am a bit tired.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;Just that you be there to help and support with the upcoming 
	battles as best as you can.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;As long as we fight, we will never lose.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I am afraid that my Master has other tasks for me to undertake.&quot;<br>
	Adso says,&quot;I will not be able to assist you again - you must learn to fight 
	Kurth on your own.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;Understood.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;I will tell others what I have learned here. I will get more 
	followers.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;Elysa is still our figurehead to follow and we'll still pledge our 
	loyalties.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso says,&quot;That is fine - there is no harm in following her. Just...don't 
	rely on her.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;Thank you for your help tonight.&quot;<br>
	Adso nods.<br>
	Adso says,&quot;Good luck.&quot;<br>
	Adso is recalling to the lifestone.<br>
	Defiance says,&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

	<p><b><a name="7"></a>Another Chat with Adso</b><p>Shadow Tempest of TD 
	reports: &quot;Hi Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	this conversation took place after Kursh attacked Zaikhal on TD today (May 
	8th, 2006). Adso asked that any Whispering Blade meet at the Chapterhouse, I 
	was the only one that could at the time get through the portal.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Adso says, &quot;My Master and the Black Knight sent me because of the difficult 
	you have had in felling Kurth.<br>
	Adso says, &quot;However, I will not be able to help you beyond this. You must 
	come up with your own means of defeating Kurth.<br>
	You say, &quot;how are we to do that? hes hard to defeat&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;You must take counsel with the rest of the Whispering Blade and 
	devise new, more effective strategies.<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I do not have the answers - I am here to prod you toward 
	devising the answers for yourselves.<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I'm just an assassin.<br>
	You say, &quot;what are his weaknesses?&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;as an assassin you should know&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;You would know better than I, having fought him. He's a larger 
	than normal Viamontian Knight.<br>
	You say, &quot;nothing like him though&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I would recommend comparing notes with the rest who fought to 
	defeat him - see what worked and what was not as successful.<br>
	You say, &quot;my lightning sword can cut down the best of the knights but barely 
	scratches him&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Also, it seems that your forces were disorganized.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;At one point, I was chased off by three or four wh htought to 
	slay me.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Some were Viamontian loyalists, it is true - but I believe some 
	may have just been mitaken.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;yes very but when he can cut through a group like butter everyone 
	scatters&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;So you must either devise a strategy that can survive Kurth 
	cutting through it, or one which helps you survive his attacks and not break 
	your formation.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;i'll talk to others with the whispering blade to see what we can 
	come up with&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Dardante is dealing in magics he doesn't understand. That's why 
	my Master has asked the Black Knight to take an interest in the Rossu Morta.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Good.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;And beward of infiltrators.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;The Viamontian loyalists appear to be crafty, as far as 
	pretending to not be what they really are.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;There was one, a Matt Heafy, whose alliance was not known to 
	me.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;this war is tearing friends apart with 3 factions and everyone 
	wants the same goal&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;First he asked me to protect him, and when I told him that it 
	was not my job to protect him, he stood near me, and as Liquid Ghost 
	approached, he cast a war spell upon me.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I would not worry about Fort Tethana, if that if the third 
	faction you refer to. Their interests are limited to their fort.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;yes because their fort wasnt protected dont you think the only way 
	for them to join with whispering blade would be to promise protection for 
	the good of dereth?&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;The Whispering Blade merely stands for opposition to Varicci. If 
	those of Fort Tethana want to join us, so be it, but we do not have the 
	manpower to protect the fort.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;That's for Elysa.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;You don't need to love Elysa to be a member. Merely hate Varicci.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;thats part of it though, varicci promises protection, in his 
	twisted ways where elysa dont&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Honestly, it's not even necessarily Varicci that I and my Master 
	are concerned with. But he brought the war, and the madman, to us.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Dardante is my chief concern.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;He is dabbling in powers he does no understand, and he risks all 
	of us.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;grael&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Speak to me of Grael. I've heard legends of an ancient, 
	Bael'zharon-like power, but nothing more.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;i dont know much about grael only what i have come across on my 
	travels, there are powers there that need not be tapped&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I agree. Some powers are not safe for us to tap, at least 
	without fully understanding them. And Dardante doesn't fully understand much 
	of what he works in.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;In any event, my time here is passing quickly and I must perform 
	another mission for my Master.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;then wouldnt it be wise to put a price on dardante's head?&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;No one would be able to claim it.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Or at least very few, but Dardante has his own protections. 
	Plus, of course, the protection of Asheron, as most of you do.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;My Master does not want to go up against Dardante directly, nor 
	does he want me to.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;that protection has been gotten around before.........&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;In unusual circumstances, and Dardante is...different.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;hes a man as any other, all have thier prices and all have 
	weaknesses&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Tell me...were you at the fight?&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;yes and took many trips to the lifestone&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;What do you feel was the biggest problem the forces faced?&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;we were greatly underpowered to that blade kurth carried&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;along with the enchantments hes been given to raise his strength 
	and general health&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;I must go. Recruit more, and organize better. I will not be able 
	to help you next time.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;thank you for your time and guidance&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Be careful to whom you disclose my advice.&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;We need not inform the enemy.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;of course&quot;<br>
	Adso says, &quot;Good fortune to you.&quot;<br>
	You say, &quot;and to you&quot;<br>

	<p><b><a name="8"></a>A Report from Morningthaw</b><p>Hiya Maggie, hope all 
	is well at home with your little one. Here's some screen shots of the action 
	after the live event on Sunday. +Admin Speed was on hand to remove vitae and 
	took requests for the spawning of special mobs. One of which was the dreaded 
	Very Mad Cow!!!! I tell ya, that's one agitated bovine!! Speed also spawned 
	some Baby TMs and full grown TMs as well as some White Rabbits. I managed 
	not to get whacked by Jared Kurth like the 3 times. He killed me on Friday 
	when I was the first to die by that big honking sword!!! I'm really proud of 
	my fellow MTers, the Whispering Blade and even them scoundrels in the Roussa 
	Morta :P. It's been great to see everyone get involved and really get into 
	this story arc. I came to the game right after the shadow wars so this is a 
	real treat for me!! Great site Maggie! 
	<p>Hawkeye Graythorn MT, Rogue Knights<br>
