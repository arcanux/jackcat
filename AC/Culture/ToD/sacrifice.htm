	December 16, 2005</font></span></p>
	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">The Map Room in the palace of Queen Elysa 
	Strathelar was secured with a pair of massive oak doors, barred against 
	unwanted interruptions. Flanking the doors were a pair of massive soldiers, 
	among the elite of the Queen's forces. They stood at attention, keeping a 
	silent lookout, alert for the miniscule chance that some hostile intruder 
	would be able to get past the outer defenses of the royal palace and 
	threaten the privacy and confidentiality of the Queen's deliberations.<br>
	<br>
	The guards were used to hearing the muffled traces of loud arguments behind 
	the thick doors. It seemed that, in times of a crisis in the realm, the 
	Queen's councilors became more likely to shout at each other during these 
	secret meetings. The guards could even tell the councilors by the sounds of 
	their voices. They could never hear specifics of the conversations, aside 
	from a particularly loud and angry curse word, but they could almost piece 
	together the course of a debate based on the pattern of raised voices.<br>
	<br>
	The debate in the map room this day was different from past gatherings, 
	however. The guards could only discern one voice raised in anger. It was a 
	younger voice that had not often been heard in those chambers, and never 
	with such rage behind it. This was the first time that the Map Room guards 
	had overheard a Strathelar family argument.</span></p>
	<p align="center"><span lang="en-us">* * * * *</span></p>
	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">&quot;... and by doing nothing, we let 
	everyone think we're just as weak as that monster Varicci says we are!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Elysa sighed. They'd been arguing in the Map Room for almost an hour. A 
	simple geography review had turned into an emotional and not entirely 
	rational debate. This was the third time that Borelean had used that 
	argument against her. Did he think she'd failed to hear him the first two 
	times?<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What would you have me do, my son?&quot; she asked.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean gestured at the map of the realm that covered the surface of the 
	table. &quot;Launch an attack on one of Varicci's holdings! Retake Fort Tethana, 
	or Marae Lassel... Just stand up for our people, mother! Don't let the 
	Viamontians think they can take over any town they like! Don't let Antius 
	die in vain...&quot; He stopped talking then, quieted by a fresh surge of grief 
	for his fallen mentor.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Has it occurred to you, son, that the rush to confront the Viamontians in a 
	battle of their choosing led Antius to his death? I did not ask him to go to 
	Glenden Wood.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It has occurred to me, mother, that Antius was the only one that people saw 
	defending them against Varicci's monsters, and he died, alone, at the hands 
	of a battle commander whose loyalty you lost!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Do not throw Kurth in my face again, Borelean. I acknowledge that I made a 
	grave error in failing to support Kurth-&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;And you made the same error with Antius!&quot; Borelean sprang out of his seat 
	this time, towering over his seated mother.<br>
	<br>
	Elysa stood up as well, to match angry glares with her son. Though he was 
	still an adolescent and not yet grown into his full height, he was as tall 
	as she was, and he seemed to draw some power from their matched heights. 
	Summoning up her anger and the commanding presence that years of rule over 
	an imperiled realm had taught her, she seemed to grow taller in her son's 
	eyes as she let out some of her own emotion.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Whatever weakness you think you see in me, my son, or whatever weakness you 
	think our people see, you will still address me with respect as your Queen 
	and as your mother. I have listened to what you have to say, and I say again 
	that, until we know more of Varicci's true capabilities, we will not engage 
	him in open battle! Not as long as there is some possibility that he has 
	more of those terrible weapons. Varicci is trying to bait us into a full 
	war! Antius will have died in vain if we refuse to take any lessons from 
	what happened to him!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean sat back down, making a visible effort to master his emotions. Soon 
	Elysa found herself staring across the table at a boy with a deceptively 
	blank face, who seemed to be only vaguely aware of her presence in the room. 
	After a long and uncomfortable silence, he looked at her and asked, &quot;May I 
	return to my chambers now, mother?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	She nodded for him to go, trying to keep her own composure. It took a lot of 
	effort for her to keep her own pain and fear from showing through. As he 
	stopped in front of the doors to raise the crossbar, she called out to him. 
	&quot;Borelean. My son.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He stopped at the door. He didn't turn to look at her, but he cocked his 
	head to let her know he was listening. &quot;Sometimes the true test of a 
	leader's strength is in knowing when not to fight. No matter how much she 
	wants to.&quot; It took more strength than she knew she had to keep her voice 
	from breaking.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean turned his head to look at her. His eyes were calm. His expression 
	was no longer angry, but neither was there warmth in his gaze. &quot;As you say, 
	mother.&quot; He nodded slightly, then lifted the crossbar, pushed open the 
	doors, and left.<br>
	<br>
	Elysa watched him go. As soon as the doors shut behind her son, she cried 
	quietly, her body shaking very slightly with sobs of grief.</span></p>
	<p align="center"><span lang="en-us">* * * * *</span></p>
	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">Borelean slammed his bedroom door behind 
	him. He took a long series of deep breaths to center himself. Then he picked 
	up his sparring sword, went into the adjoining practice room, and began the 
	exercises that Antius had taught him. He knew the movements so well he could 
	do them in his sleep. He had become even more dedicated to his sword 
	practice in the wake of Antius' death.<br>
	<br>
	Halfway through his training session, he stopped suddenly, cutting short the 
	follow-through on an overhand slash. He sensed he was no longer alone in the 
	room. Scanning his surroundings quickly with alert and well-trained eyes, he 
	located the intruder, in a corner behind him. He turned, dropped into a 
	guard stance, and then just as quickly let his guard back down.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, with some distaste, &quot;it's you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's me,&quot; the intruder agreed. &quot;I take it the discussion with your mother 
	went no better than yesterday's?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean shrugged. &quot;It lasted longer and I made her more upset than I did 
	yesterday. No, I did no better.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;She's a hard-headed woman. And hard-hearted, it seems. The realm cries for 
	vengeance, and still she urges caution...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I'll not have you speaking so of my mother. It's bad enough that I even 
	talk to you. And I know you're just trying to manipulate me. I shouldn't 
	have gone back to her for another argument today. It's just making things 
	worse.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You're probably right,&quot; said the intruder. &quot;Let's talk about ways to make 
	things better. Did you do all that reading I told you to do?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean nodded. &quot;Yes, but I had to sneak into the restricted wing of the 
	library for some of the books you told me to read.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Clever lad. Let's continue your education.&quot;</span></p>

	December 20th, 2005</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Count Dardante sat at his desk, pouring over a diagram 
	of arcane sigils that had been copied from an ancient tomb by some of his 
	assistants. He'd spent the last several days analyzing a sheaf of such 
	tracings, and felt no closer to unlocking the mysteries they contained.<br>
	<br>
	He put aside the papers, rubbing his eyes in exhaustion. There was a knock 
	on his office door, and then the door swung slowly open. Dardante prepared a 
	biting rebuke for whichever of his assistants intruded upon him without 
	being called in – and then he noticed that the intruder was his King, 
	Varicci II.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Majesty... I had not expected you here at my remote outpost,&quot; Dardante 
	said, trying to pull together his scattered thoughts.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I didn't think you would expect me, Dardante. How goes the translation 
	effort?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Dardante grimaced. &quot;It comes slowly, Majesty. The sigils bear superficial 
	resemblance to some of the ones we found on the Dericostian tombs, but when 
	we try to read the characters together, the language is gibberish... I think 
	we have stumbled across yet another Empyrean sect, which uses a very similar 
	alphabet.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci snorted. &quot;These Empyreans are even more fractious and troublesome 
	than the Bloodless on Ispar.&quot; He tapped on Dardante's desk. &quot;The real reason 
	I have come is to bring you out of here. I would have you return to Sanamar 
	for a time, to advise me on our current efforts in the Grael matter.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Is there new information on that one?&quot; Dardante asked.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;There is. It may, in fact, shed further light on the nature of the beast 
	himself. The scholars who examined this latest set of artifacts are quite 
	excited. They seem to have found themselves a firsthand account of Grael.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Dardante rose from his desk eagerly. &quot;Say no more. True first-hand sources 
	would be invaluable. We spent far too much time pursuing the false leads and 
	ignorant theories we found among those benighted cultists.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	With that said, Dardante rolled up the pages of arcane diagrams to take with 
	him. He wanted to share them with the scholars in Sanamar again. He locked 
	the rest of his notes in a chest behind his chair. With his office secured, 
	he turned to accompany the King outside.<br>
	<br>
	On their way to the courtyard of the fortified compound, another question 
	occurred to Dardante. &quot;Majesty, if I may ask, whatever became of those 
	cultists we captured?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Most of them were given over to the Vivimancers for reshaping. We had 
	wanted to keep them in captivity longer, in the unlikely chance that we 
	would be able to extract some useful knowledge from them... But given some 
	of our recent military setbacks, the need for shock troops overwhelmed that 
	consideration. A few of the most thaumaturgically promising have been kept, 
	in case we do decide we need to wring more secrets from them, or simply use 
	them as experimental fodder.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Dardante nodded. &quot;It would be a good to have a few on hand for some more 
	severance experiments that I had in mind,&quot; he said. &quot;If we can solve that 
	problem without having to delve too deeply into the mysteries of Grael, I 
	would consider the realm well served.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci stopped to look at his most senior thaumaturgical advisor. &quot;It is 
	true that I am only interested in Grael so far as knowledge of him, or his 
	power, would serve the war effort... But you, my friend? If we had our 
	severance solution tomorrow, would you truly abandon your Grael research?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Dardante smiled slowly as he turned to face his King. &quot;No, Majesty. For my 
	own interest, I want to know all there is to know about Grael.&quot;</span></p>

    <p><span lang="en-us">Greetings and welcome to the December Letter to the 
	Players. <br>
	<br>
	In the last month we saw King Varicci took his assault to the next level. 
	Through some form of dark design, King Varicci was able to acquire and use a 
	new type of weapon to kill Antius Blackmoor. What will Queen Elyssa's 
	reaction to this be? Will she send out an immediate force to seek revenge? 
	Or will she be too upset at the loss of someone so important to her?<br>
	<br>
	<b>New for December</b><br>
	After gathering feedback from the players, the changes to the Temples of 
	Forgetfulness and Enlightenment have gone in this month. We feel these 
	changes will help both new and old players make changes to their characters 
	while also not allowing anyone to abuse the abilities granted by these 
	temples. The following is a list of how the timers will be changed when you 
	go to the temples after the December event goes live.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Untrain</b><br>
	1st-4th gems: Instant<br>
	5th-8th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	9th-16th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	17th and above: 3 week timer<br>
	<b><br>
	</b>Specialization<br>
	1st-2nd gems: Instant<br>
	3rd-4th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	5th-8th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	9th and above: 3 week timer<br>
	<br>
	<b>Attribute</b><br>
	1st-18th: Instant<br>
	19th-36th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	37th and above: 2 week timer<br>
	<br>
	Also please note there is a 2 week timer on handing in any Tesserae.<br>
	<br>
	The Hotkey issue that was causing players to lose their save hotkey 
	selections has been resolved. The items that players put in the hotkey slots 
	should now stay there after they log off.<br>
	<br>
	Players will be able to turn in their Glenden Wood Recall Orb for a scroll 
	of the same spell. This will allow players to still have the recall without 
	having to have the orb which can cause players to get stuck in combat mode.<br>
	<br>
	The winter season is here and once again snow has started to fall. This 
	seasonal change also means that some creature spawns will change 
	accordingly. Scarecrows and Pumpkin Golems have been removed from the 
	landscape. Instead players will find an increasing amount of Snowmen 
	spawning throughout the land. <br>
	<br>
	With the death of Antius, the people of Dereth have realized that a change 
	is in the air. This has prompted them to take action. The town of Yanshi has 
	finally rebuilt and has been fortified. You can find the new town near the 
	Yanshi festival grounds. There has also been a memorial built there for the 
	great Antius Blackmoor. Deep below the memorial, Antius lays in his final 
	resting place. The citizens of Dereth may still go and pay their respects if 
	they already haven't done so. <br>
	<br>
	The invasion of Glenden Wood appears to have been pushed back, thanks to the 
	aid of the brave people of Dereth. The Royal Captains have now moved in and 
	have secured the area. Though there are still reports of some Viamontian 
	activities in the area. Speaking to Tomo Genza may yield more information on 
	this.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>In-Concept</b><br>
	These are some the game changes we are thinking about for the upcoming 
	months in Asheron's Call. We cannot guarantee when- or even if – any of 
	these changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and priorities can 
	change. These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items 
	we'll be introducing in each monthly event. Your feedback on these topics is 
	particularly valuable.<br>
	<br>
	- PK/PKL Arenas(more details on these will be coming)<br>
	- Additional Allegiance Management Improvements<br>
	- Friends Panel<br>
	- Player-vs-Player Improvements<br>
	- Additional High level Hunting Areas<br>
	- Story Driven Loyalty Decisions<br>
	<br>
	The items that are included in this section are just some of the things we 
	are looking at for future changes. As time goes on this list will continue 
	to change and expand. As always, all in-concept ideas are subject to change 
	with scheduling and priority changes.<br>

	players to make meaningful decisions about their characters' true 
	loyalties.&nbsp; I think there's a great deal for Asheron's Call players to look 
	forward to, and we the devs are happy to have the opportunity to continue to 
	work on this well-loved game.</p>
	<p>I know that there are a number of specific issues that people would like 
	to know our future plans on, so let's get into those:</p>
	<p><strong>PvP Enhancements:</strong>&nbsp; <br>
	PvP is a tricky issue.&nbsp; I don't think it is a good idea to make changes that 
	would radically alter the way PvP works, or PvP balance.&nbsp; For every person 
	who wants a dynamic changed, there are others who like the dynamic the way 
	it is, and would be upset with any changes.&nbsp; With that in mind, we do have 
	plans for additional PvP content.&nbsp; We have plans to give PvPs new things to 
	fight over and new enhancements for PvP combat.&nbsp; One of the most common 
	complaints about PvP seems to be that it simply takes too long to resolve a 
	fight, because of super-high-health templates and equipment.&nbsp; One goal we 
	are working on, and are debating solutions for, is to make PvP fights 
	shorter and more exciting.&nbsp; Whatever we do is going to be based on feedback 
	from the dedicated PvP community, starting with my recent &quot;Looking for PvP 
	Feedback&quot; post on the PvP board.</p>
	<p><strong>Storyline:<br>
	</strong>The Viamontian Conflict storyline is going forward full steam.&nbsp; 
	We've introduced new lore and killed off a major lore character.&nbsp; There 
	seems to be a strong sentiment to have this storyline lead to meaningful 
	character decisions.&nbsp; I agree that, in the midst of a story about civil war, 
	characters should make hard choices.&nbsp; We plan to continue with the theme of 
	opposed quests that we had in Throne of Destiny, where you could choose to 
	undertake quests for Sanamar or Silyun.&nbsp; </p>
	<p><strong>New Features:&nbsp;<br>
	</strong>Our development schedule gives us some amount of leeway to work on 
	new gameplay features or enhancement to current features.&nbsp; Each of these 
	requires a good deal of work and testing, and often spread out over several 
	months.&nbsp; While I cannot talk about specific features, the kind of things we 
	are discussing are along the lines of expanding existing systems or offering 
	new twists to existing content.&nbsp; We are not going alter the fundamental 
	personality of the game, but add to existing elements to deepen or broaden 
	the gameplay that is already available.&nbsp; The proposals we have on the table 
	are pretty exciting.&nbsp; During the development of Throne of Destiny, we spent 
	a lot of time overhauling the game engine, freeing us to do some things we 
	were not able to do before.&nbsp; You've already been told about the new Friends 
	panel that's coming in January.&nbsp; You can expect us to steadily add more 
	great features like that in the months ahead.</p>
	<p><strong>High Level Concerns:</strong>&nbsp; <br>
	I know a lot of people were looking forward to Land Control as a new way to 
	enjoy high-level gameplay.&nbsp; I was sad that we had to make the decision to 
	shelve those plans, but the system just demanded too much tech and design 
	work to realistically expect to be able to do it.&nbsp; When we developed the 
	&quot;booster pack&quot; plan to implement Land Control outside of the development of 
	Throne of Destiny, the plan was to have one engineer and one designer work 
	solely on Land Control for six months to a year. Unfortunately, our current 
	resource planning does not allow us to properly focus on a project of that 
	size.&nbsp; We are very eager to improve the experience for our longest-running 
	and most loyal players with content beyond high-level hunting grounds, and 
	we have some intriguing proposals on how to do this.&nbsp; However, we will have 
	to continue to be careful about the way we manage our resources.</p>
	<p><strong>Advertising and New Players:&nbsp; <br>
	</strong>Quite a few people on our message boards have expressed concern 
	about the lack of advertising for Asheron's Call.&nbsp; For reasons I'm sure you 
	can appreciate, our marketing team is focused on other projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our 
	strategy for Asheron's Call is to rely on fan loyalty and word of mouth to 
	grow the game.&nbsp; You, the players, can help by getting your friends to join 
	you in Dereth, or to encourage friends who have left Dereth to come back and 
	check out all the great stuff we've added.&nbsp; You've already been doing a 
	great job with this.&nbsp; New players are still signing up, and we've seen even 
	more players coming back.&nbsp; I realize people have had difficulty finding the 
	game at their local store.&nbsp; To help fix this, we are working on making 
	Throne of Destiny available via download.</p>
	<p align="center"><span lang="en-us">********</span></p>
	<p>We stated a few months ago, when the decision was made to bring the team 
	back to Boston, that we would have a smaller team and, as a consequence, the 
	updates would be smaller.&nbsp; This has not changed, but Turbine is still 
	looking to grow the team a bit more.&nbsp; It is difficult to find strong talent, 
	and especially difficult to get people to come to Boston in the middle of 
	winter.&nbsp; I fully expect that, as we add talent, and as team members become 
	accustomed to new roles, we will be able to create more content for our 
	updates.&nbsp; As you can imagine, it's not a quick process to ramp up to work on 
	a game as complex and with as rich a development history as Asheron's Call.&nbsp; 
	In my time on the original Live team from 1999 to 2001, I was learning new 
	skills until my last day.</p>
	<p>I recognize that some of our players are dissatisfied with the size of 
	the content updates and with the postponement or shelving of previously 
	announced plans.&nbsp; I can assure you that none of the decisions we made were 
	made lightly.&nbsp; I can also assure you that we are doing our best to keep 
	improving this game with new and entertaining content.</p>
	<p>I was pretty sure we were going to get some negative feedback on the 
	statement about Land Control in Frelorn's January 4 update.&nbsp; While the news 
	was unwelcome, it was also honest information, and I hope that people will 
	recognize the spirit of honesty that drove it.&nbsp; I didn't want to make vague 
	promises of future goodies, but to instead tell you, in a straightforward 
	manner, what was going on.&nbsp; I will continue to be as honest as I can, and to 
	avoid making big promises that we won't be able to fulfill.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>As for our plans for Asheron's Call, I'll reiterate that there are no 
	plans to turn off the servers.&nbsp; We as a team are committed to continuing to 
	develop our ongoing stories, provide entertaining content, and add cool 
	features to the game.&nbsp; We have some fun and exciting ideas that I think 
	people will enjoy. </p>
	<p>I'd like to thank everyone for their continued support and feedback.&nbsp; 
	Asheron's Call is a labor of love for every team member here.&nbsp; We're excited 
	about the future of the game, and we hope you are looking forward to 
	questing and adventuring with us.<span lang="en-us"><br>
