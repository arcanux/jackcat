	<br>
	Hello there everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend!<br>
	<br>
	As most of you know by now, it’s time for the September event, Come What 
	Follows. This is the month we let pets roam free in Dereth for the first 
	time, and we are all very excited about this. Please keep in mind however 
	that they are still a work in progress and sometimes may act a bit… funny. 
	Over time we will continue to adjust things as we go to improve how pets 
	work and what they can do. Those little guys are pretty cute, though. <br>
	<br>
	We also know that some of you are concerned over what impact pets will have 
	on game performance. We feel that this should not be an issue, but we will 
	be watching things closely over the next few weeks to make sure that there 
	is no negative impact from the Pets.<br>
	<br>
	As was pointed out yesterday in another thread, our advertisements have 
	begun to show up online, this time over at the Microsoft Marketplace. This 
	is the first of many more ads that we, along with many of our partners will 
	be running. <br>
	<br>
	This week we are working on all things Festival, as we are in full swing on 
	development for the October event. This is the time when all the writing is 
	done and the beginnings of implementation start. This is the fun time, when 
	all of the little details of each thing being done get worked out. <br>
	<br>
	Finally we would like to thank everyone for the suggestions given to us in 
	last weeks update for quests or areas you would like to see us go back and 
	take another look at. I am gathering all of that information together for 
	the team and we will go from there deciding what to do with all those 
	suggestions. That kind of feedback is very important to us, so again thank 
	you. <br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a great week!<br>

	<p><b>Hotfix: Friday September 15th 9am EDT - 12pm EDT. Updated - 9/12/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showpost.php?p=308847&amp;postcount=1">by

	<br>
	There will be a hotfix on Friday September 15th from 9am EDT - 12pm EDT. 
	During this time all worlds will be down. <br>
	<br>
	The issues being addressed in this fix are:<br>
	<br>
	If you give your Shou-jen Shozoku Mask back to the NPC who gave it to you, 
	the NPC will not give the mask back to you. This should be resolved after 
	the fix. <br>
	<br>
	We will also be fixing the Zefir, Tusker, Elemental and Fallen Creature kill 
	tasks. If you have already completed the actual tasks yet have not been able 
	to actually finish these quests, you will just need to speak to the NPC’s 
	again and they will finish the quest for you.<br>

	<br>
	Here is the list of things being addressed in the hotfix this morning.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	If you give your Shou-jen Shozoku Mask back to the NPC who gave it to you, 
	the NPC will not give the mask back to you. This will now be fixed. <br>
	<br>
	There was a small issue where under the right circumstances a pet could be 
	used to cause damage to another player. This has been resolved. <br>
	<br>
	The Zefir, Tusker, Elemental and Fallen Creature kill tasks have all been 
	fixed and should now correctly finish when you are done with the task. If 
	you have already killed the required number of creatures for one of these 
	tasks, you will just need to speak to that quest NPC to complete the quest 
	and get your reward. <br>
	<br>
	On the Jitte of Mi Krau-Li quest, players were able to pick up the Cartilage 
	off of Old Scratchy without completing the earlier steps in the quest. This 
	has been fixed and now players must be at the proper point of the quest in 
	order to pick up the Cartilage.<br>

	<p>Hello there everyone, I hope you all had a great weekend.<br>
	<br>
	Let’s get right into this weeks update.<br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on implementation of things going in for the 
	October event. That means seeing what they dreamt up live and in living 
	color. This is when the fun begins as we get to see for the first time some 
	of the ideas that were previously just on paper. The testing and balance for 
	these things also begin this week as part of what is seen for the first 
	time. <br>
	<br>
	It seems from most accounts that the random raids that went off over the 
	weekend went over well. From the Tanada Clan raids to random objects roaming 
	the landscape, fun was had by all involved. IN the coming weeks we will be 
	continuing to have these events aimed at players having fun. Some things may 
	change, while others stay the same. The only thing I regret about these 
	events is that I did not get to take part in any as a player. <br>
	<br>
	I want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that Massive Magazine 
	launches this week on the 19th featuring Asheron’s Call on the back cover. 
	Make sure to hit your local newsstand or bookstore and pick up a copy. I 
	will be picking up a few copies for myself and the team when the time comes.
	<br>
	<br>
	Last but not least I would like to put out a gentle reminder about personal 
	attacks here of the forums. While I understand and appreciate people being 
	passionate about the things they believe in related to Asheron’s Call, being 
	passionate does not justify personally attacking other posters here on the 
	forums. Please remember to keep all discussion civil, or it may result in a 
	ban or the locking of a thread. All this requires is a little common sense 
	and courtesy, and we can all be happy and get along here. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p>Good afternoon and welcome to the September 25th edition of the AC weekly 
	update.<br>
	<br>
	This week the team continues to work on things for the October event. This 
	is always one of our favorite times of the year, getting to work on things 
	for the festival season. Some of the most creative things we have done came 
	from the festival events. Not to mention some the fun had at the creative 
	meetings throwing out the ideas. Overall the way things look right now, 
	everyone should enjoy this year just as much as years past, if not more. <br>
	<br>
	While I have your attention I would like to address why I haven’t been 
	posting as much lately. The last few weeks have been really busy for me and 
	everyone on the team. Along with making sure that the monthly updates get 
	out on time, we have been doing alot of work getting things set for our ad 
	campaign. Between getting the assets together and working out all the 
	contracts and building the online ads, things have been on the busy side. 
	Not to mention that we are still working on giving the website a facelift in 
	the not so distant future. I am not trying to use any of these things as an 
	excuse for not posting as much, since it is my job to keep everyone informed 
	as much as possible as to what is going on. I just wanted to let everyone 
	know that while I have not been posting as much, I am still reading every 
	post on the forums and every PM sent to me. <br>
	<br>
	So on that note, I am going to use the rest of this update to answer a 
	couple of questions. <br>
	<br>
	Will we ever see a “Cast on Strike” imbue?<br>
	Right now there are no plans to add this as a player imbue. As always this 
	can change in the future as we move forward, but for now it is not in the 
	foreseeable future. <br>
	<br>
	Can we have a new PvP server?<br>
	This is a question that seems to pop up every couple of months. We have no 
	plans to open another server at this time. Our goals right now are to focus 
	on the worlds we have already. The amount of time and resources it would 
	take to start another world would severely take away from the normal flow of 
	things on the worlds we have now. That is not to say this will never happen, 
	but right now we are more focused on what we have already. <br>
	<br>
	What is the deal with the preorder gem?<br>
	So this has been one of the more debated topics on the forums over the last 
	few months. Many possible solutions have come to us through some heated 
	discussions here on the forums. As of today while I am writing this we have 
	not yet made a decision on this issue. Of the things that have been 
	suggested to us there are a few that stand out. Make an augmentation for an 
	8% health bonus. Not quite as good as the 10% but good enough that the 
	balance issue is gone, plus players who did not preorder would have to give 
	up some XP to get it. The 8% would not be stackable with the preorder gem. 
	Another solution suggested was to sell the preorder gem to players who 
	wanted to buy it for a nominal fee online. Again, most preorder folks did 
	not have to buy them so they got something for free while these people need 
	to pay for it. Yet another suggestion was just make the gem not work in PvP 
	or when you are red. This one is quite frankly not possible right now, and 
	not fair. Players should not be punished just because they choose to take 
	part in PvP or play on Darktide. As you can see this is not an easy decision 
	for us. <br>
	<br>
	There were just a couple of the options that have been laid out before us, 
	there were many more that have been sent to us since this issue came up. 
	This is not an easy choice for us to make, but it is something we are going 
	to have to make a decision about. Let me be clear that the above examples 
	are not necessarily the ones we are going to choose from but rather just the 
	first couple of examples I looked at on my list. When the time comes that we 
	have made a final decision we will let everyone know. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Everyone have a great day and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hello and welcome to the October 2nd edition of the Asheron’s Call Weekly 
	Update!<br>
	<br>
	This week the team is putting the finishing touches on the October event, 
	Dance of the Dead, tentatively scheduled to go live on October 10th. If 
	there is any change to this date we will let you know. <br>
	<br>
	We are also continuing to work on getting the word out about Asheron’s Call 
	to as many people as possible. This means that we are working on more ads to 
	go out in various online and print mediums. As these ads go live and are 
	available I will do my best to point them all out to everyone. <br>
	<br>
	One of the things we are really looking forward to in the October event is 
	the unveiling of the Viamontian Racial Masks. These are something players 
	have been asking about since the Viamontian’s came to be a playable race in 
	Asheron’s Call. The team, in particular Kintani, spent alot of time making 
	these masks, and I must say they came out quite nice. <br>
	<br>
	Finally I would like to make an announcement about some changes to the 
	Asheron’s Call team. Lupus Argenteus, who was our QA Lead, is now the 
	Asheron’s Call Systems Integrator. What exactly does that mean? As soon as 
	we figure that out I will let you know.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Stick Out Tongue" alt="" src="come/tongue.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"> 
	Actually what it means is that he will now be working more closely with the 
	team in updating some older systems as well as some of the older quests in 
	the game. Django will be taking over the role of heading up QA testing for 
	Asheron’s Call. We are all very excited about these moves and we will have 
	more information about other changes to the team in the coming weeks. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hello there and welcome to the October 9th edition of the weekly update!<br>
	<br>
	It is monthly event time! Tuesday October 10th at 8am EDT, all worlds will 
	be brought down for the event Dance of the Dead. This is our annual fall 
	event which brings in some fun and games to the people of Dereth. Masks and 
	costumes, tricks and treats and a few surprises. <br>
	<br>
	Since it appears that the message sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of the 
	Letter to the Players and the event fiction. I would like to remind everyone 
	that the LttP does not list the new quests or all of the new content going 
	into the game. We like to leave the discovery of the new things up to our 
	players. Sometimes this part gets missed even though it is stated in the 
	LttP.<br>
	<br>
	This week the team is busy working on the November event, which will begin 
	ramping up the next story arc. No, I won’t tell you what the next arc is 
	going to be about, but I will say some questions will be answered with this 
	arc. You will just have to wait and see what we have in store for November.
	<br>
	<br>
	As always make sure to keep an eye on the forums when the worlds are down, 
	for any updates. We will be sure to post any updates during the downtime on 
	Tuesday. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you in Dereth!<br>
