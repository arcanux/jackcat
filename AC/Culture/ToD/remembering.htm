	Turbine Site</a>, November 10, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p>
    Hasin Lin cut his way through the thick underbrush at the edge of the forest 
	clearing. In the middle of the clearing sat a simple wooden cottage and a 
	small stone shrine. The sweet smell of burning incense wafted in his 
	direction from the shrine, and he saw a thin curl of smoke drifting up from 
	the chimney of the cottage.<br>
	<br>
	He stopped in front of the shrine, bowed reverently before it, and lit 
	another stick of incense. Then he got up and stood in front of the cottage's 
	door, which was a simple curtain made from the cured hides of Reedsharks. 
	With slow and deliberate movements, he took off his boots, his pack, and his 
	weapons and set them all neatly by the side of the door. Then he stood at 
	attention in front of the doorway. Only after a soft voice called &quot;Enter&quot; 
	did he step over the threshold of the cottage.<br>
	<br>
	An old Sho woman sat at a low table in the center of the cottage. The only 
	furnishings in the room were a bedroll, a bookcase filled with a densely 
	packed mass of books and scrolls, and a stone fireplace that doubled as a 
	cooking pit. An ancient, exquisitely maintained bonsai tree sat on the table 
	in front of the woman, along with a tea kettle and a pair of bowls.<br>
	<br>
	The woman smiled at Lin as he entered. He bowed deeply before her, which she 
	acknowledged with a graceful tilt of her head. She motioned for him to sit 
	at the table. He sat cross-legged in front of her, and she proceeded to pour 
	them each a bowl of hot tea. Lin sipped nervously at the tea, waiting for 
	her to speak. She sipped her tea, smiling serenely at him, seemingly content 
	to sit in silence.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, the old woman spoke. &quot;I'm grateful you accepted my invitation to 
	come here and share tea with me, Tracker Lin. May I call you Lin?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lin nodded quickly. &quot;I am honored to be here, Mistress.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I apologize if my messenger was vague or secretive with the invitation. I 
	do not like to involve myself in the politics of the realm, and I prefer 
	discretion to... brash displays. I think it would surprise most people to 
	learn that I even have apprentices.&quot; She poured him some more tea.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I completely understand, Mistress,&quot; he responded. &quot;I would not ask you to 
	explain your actions to me. I came because you asked for me.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The old woman laughed. &quot;Keep talking like that, Tracker Lin, and I may give 
	in to my vanity. No, I just don't wish to cultivate a reputation for 
	inscrutability. I find such pretenses to be so tiresome. Now, I will be 
	direct here. I need you to track someone down for me. I have been told that 
	you have some talent in this.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lin nodded modestly. &quot;I have had some success serving the Queen's forces as 
	a tracker and a scout. I serve in the best way I know how. Who is it that 
	you seek, Mistress?&quot; <br>
	<br>
	She looked him directly in the eyes. &quot;I seek Asheron.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lin nearly dropped his bowl. &quot;Asheron? Well... I thought...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The old woman laughed. &quot;I apologize, Tracker Lin. I am being inscrutable 
	again. It is Asheron I seek, but it is not Asheron whom I would ask you to 
	track. There is a new presence in the world, a dangerous and secretive 
	presence...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lin nodded. &quot;Is this about the Tanada? I've already spent some time 
	investigating them - &quot;<br>
	<br>
	The woman grimaced. &quot;No, but I have been made aware of them as well. I have 
	asked others to investigate the appearance in Dereth of those poor fallen 
	souls. Their case is tragic, and they could be a true danger, but as far as 
	I know, they are not involved with the... prolonged absence of Asheron.&quot; She 
	closed her eyes and took a deep breath, and Lin could see that she'd sunk 
	into some kind of meditative state.<br>
	<br>
	He sipped his tea in deferential silence and waited for her to continue. 
	After a moment, she opened her eyes again, and he could see a troubling note 
	of fear and apprehension in her wide-eyed gaze.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;A menace both old and new has come to Dereth. Our people have had the 
	singular luck to settle a land that has been precious to old and powerful 
	beings... Beings that can see and touch the different layers of the worlds, 
	who creep across the island's lines of power like a spider over its own 
	web... They are strong, in their way, but they are also dangerously out of 
	balance and prisoners of their own terrible history... They have warred over 
	this land in ages past, and would reclaim it now. They seek to do away with 
	the land's most potent guardian.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Her eyes were glazing over, and Lin was no longer sure that she was still 
	aware he was there. He cleared his throat softly, and she seemed to snap out 
	of her reverie and refocus on him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I apologize, Tracker Lin. There is so much noise in the world these days. I 
	still hear echoes of the Hopeslayer, and the traumas of past years still 
	resonate... The bestial howls of Grael are particularly jarring. But yes, 
	let us speak of the being I would have you track. He is an ancient soul, and 
	his talents are much the same as yours, though he hunts his prey not in the 
	forest or the jungle, but through the pathways of spirit...&quot; She paused to 
	sip her tea.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He is a hunter and a tracker. It was his job to track his prey, study the 
	habits of his prey. To prepare a trap on behalf of his masters. I would have 
	you study him and learn his habits. To track the tracker, and thereby lead 
	us, through him, to the secret masters who direct his efforts.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lin's breath stopped short. &quot;Mistress, I am honored that you would think me 
	worthy for this task, but if this being is as powerful as you say, I am not 
	a true warrior, nor a mage to do battle with sorcerous creatures...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The old woman nodded and poured them both some more tea. &quot;I know, Tracker 
	Lin. I would not ask you to fight this creature, or to enter his lair. To 
	fight him will be the part of others...&quot;<br>

	from the <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=500">Turbine Site</a>, November 
	21, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Ardry sat cross-legged on the hard stone floor, 
	backlit by the purple glow of the portal behind him. His leather armor was 
	thoroughly riddled with cuts and puncture wounds and sodden with his own 
	blood. He scrawled a hurried note in his journal.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Passed through second portal and second school. Acolytes training with 
	bows. Got good chance to practice the &quot;Technique of Wind and Smoke&quot; that 
	Adso passed on to me. Acolytes still managed to perforate me. Must ask him 
	for further practice in those techniques, if he will indulge me. Otherwise I 
	may return to this school and engage in another mutual practice session with 
	some killers in training.</i><br>
	<br>
	He closed the journal and slid it back into the large pouch at his side. His 
	wounded hand left another sticky patch of half-dried blood on the journal 
	cover. He'd at least been prudent enough to purchase a journal bound in 
	dark, rich leather, so that the dozens of blood stains on the cover merely 
	served as interesting texture rather than the grisly monuments of his 
	regular punishment at the hands of creatures who objected to his scouting 
	missions.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry stood up slowly, wincing at the pain in his joints and muscles. He'd 
	done his best to patch up the multiple wounds he had absorbed from the 
	sword-wielding acolytes he'd first encountered, but the rain of arrows he'd 
	endured in the second school had left deeper, more painful wounds that still 
	throbbed long after the health potions and healing kits had done their work. 
	A patch of blood-drenched leather fell from his cuirass, and he stared at 
	it, numb.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Next time I'll just ask Uncle Aliester if there are any more masks he'd 
	like me to pick up,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Could have gone on more mask-collection 
	duty, but no, I had to try and curry favor with Jina, just because I thought 
	that would get me a meeting with her. Even chasing snakes and ghosts in 
	swampy holes is better than being an archery target...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	His gaze wandered around the room, and he saw again the shrine and the 
	bloodied medallion he'd left lying on top of it. Somehow that sight brought 
	him back to himself. Realizing how foolish he had been to speak out loud in 
	this complex, he paused to focus himself. He used some of the new breathing 
	techniques he'd been taught, pushed the pain out of his mind, and steeled 
	himself to walk through the next portal.<br>
	<br>
	When the familiar lurching of portal travel ended, he found himself in a 
	situation he'd run into twice before: he was tense and silent in an empty 
	room while acolytes trained in the next room. He listened to the shouting 
	and battle cries. He looked around again to make sure he was alone, then 
	quickly opened his journal.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Sitting by training room in third school. This one, ominously, called 
	&quot;School of Breath&quot;. Cannot understand what they are shouting. Not sure if it 
	is sound distortion or if they are speaking a language I can't understand. 
	Doesn't sound at all like the commands that Masters of Storms and Wind were 
	shouting at their acolytes. Will have to expose myself to risk if I want to 
	get better perspective.<br>
	</i><br>
	Again he packed away the journal and dropped to a stealthy crouch. He slowly 
	crept around the corner and tried to minimize his profile, to blend against 
	the stone wall. The rooms in this complex were not well lit, and the dancing 
	shadows that were cast by the acolytes in the training room helped greatly 
	in his effort to remain inconspicuous. As he crept closer, he at least 
	became sure that the acolytes were not speaking any language that he 
	recognized. He also saw that they were not training with swords or bows. No, 
	these Acolytes of Breath were learning combat techniques that Ardry found 
	much more menacing. He began to back up from his half-hidden position to 
	retreat to the safety of the other room, when he heard a faint noise behind 
	him. He sighed softly to himself. He knew what that sound was.<br>
	<br>
	The acolytes were not as accomplished in the arts of stealth, yet, as some 
	of their more completely trained brethren that Ardry had encountered. He'd 
	heard the approach of the patrolling acolyte behind him, a second before the 
	acolyte noticed him. In another situation, with the techniques he'd learned 
	recently, he might have been able to parlay that kind of advantage into a 
	quick and unnoticed kill. Not so here, not when he was stuck between one 
	acolyte on patrol and a room full of acolytes training to be better killers.<br>
	<br>
	A brisk, clipped word from the patrolling acolyte caught the attention of 
	the ones in the training room. As one, their dark eyes, not yet covered by 
	the black mask worn by their masters, went to their brother in the corridor, 
	and then to the sneaking spy that their brother had caught. As one, eight 
	acolytes shifted to fighting stance, and the air in the subterranean room 
	hissed as they exhaled at once.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry groaned out loud. &quot;I should have stayed in Ayan and accepted Ulgrim's 
	challenge. That's what I should have done.&quot;</span></p>

		15 days in order to purchase any form of housing. Since the free trial 
		is 14 days, this means that if you are on a free trial account, you will

	- <font face="Arial" size="1">from the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=496">Turbine Site</a>, 
	November 10, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Welcome to the November Letter to the Players!<br>
	<br>
	With the Festival season in full swing, this is normally a time of peace and 
	tranquility in Dereth. This year however, appears to be different. Some 
	questions still remain unanswered and there are people who want to know why. 
	Can I out Drink Ulgrim? Why are the members of the Tanada Clan suddenly in 
	Dereth after all this time? Where has Asheron been for the last year? What 
	is the meaning of life? Ok so maybe that last one won't get answered, but 
	other questions and more will begin to be answered with the November event, 
	Remembering the Past!<br>
	<br>
	<b>Addressing Asheron's Benediction </b><br>
	For some time now players have been asking us to look into the matter of the 
	pre order health gem, Asheron's Benediction and the balance issues it has 
	caused. When the November event goes live, players will be able to get a new 
	augmentation at a cost of 2 billion XP, which when used will grant the 
	player an 8% bonus to their health. Getting this Augmentation will place a 
	gem in the users pack similar to the already existing pre order gem. The 
	health bonus will not be stackable with the 10% pre order gem. This new 
	augmentation will come at a cost of 2 billion XP. We do understand that 
	making this change is going to stir up some very strong feelings both for 
	and against this new augmentation. We feel that this is the best solution to 
	what was a growing problem. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Masks you say?!</b><br>
	After taking some time off, the crafters of Dereth have created the latest 
	tier of heritage masks. There is a new mask for each playable race in the 
	game. Make sure to get them all! <br>
	<br>
	<b>Housing Improvements</b><br>
	Several new items have been added to the list of things that Agents of the 
	Arcanum will accept in exchange for Writs of Refuge. Make sure to check in 
	with the agents for the updated list. <br>
	<br>
	In keeping with the idea of wanting to improve the overall housing 
	experience, mansion owners should now be able to hook two more portal 
	devices and two more casting devices. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Quest Love</b><br>
	The quest item from The Mines of Despair can now be turned in for XP rewards 
	if you feel you do not need the item. <br>
	<br>
	The Orphanage quest has been revised. A new step has been added and players 
	will be able to obtain experience along with the classic reward. Based on 
	these changes, the timer for turning in the item from the Orphanage is now 
	13 days. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Drink anyone?</b><br>
	Ulgrim has decided he want to test everyone's drinking prowess. Players may 
	want to spend some time on Ulgrim's Island looking for a way to challenge 
	him. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. Each month we 
	will be discussing one new in concept topic, in order to give you as much 
	information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Quest Organizer</b><br>
	We are currently investigating options for identifying and organizing quests 
	in the game for the benefit of our players. A lot of content has been 
	introduced into the game over the seven years that Asheron's Call has 
	existed, and the first, and largest, step is going to be to try to organize 
	this information in some sort of fashion that is useful to players – give 
	intended levels for content, quest starters, estimates on how long a piece 
	of content takes, and whether it's balanced for group or solo play. We are 
	also going to investigate how difficult it will be to hook in quest flags 
	and such into the display UI, to reflect your current status on any quests 
	you embark upon. There's still a great deal of groundwork to be laid, and at 
	this early stage <u>we cannot make any promises</u> as to the form it will 
	eventually take – depending on how the tech works out, it may be as simple 
	as an additional help file cataloging the quests of our game, or as complex 
	as a fully-featured UI with all sorts of tracking options. We also would 
	likely not put newly-introduced quests on it until a subsequent month, as we 
	do want to preserve the experience of discovering content for the first 
	time. However, we are committed to making any quest system the best we can 
	within the limits of our technology.<br>
	<br>
