	<p><span lang="en-us">Adso stood guard, eyes alertly scanning the horizon, 
	ready to react to anything that appeared in his peripheral vision. All 
	around them, the ground was blackened and littered with debris. Behind him, 
	his Master knelt over a human corpse.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Just as I thought,&quot; said his Master, &quot;this one has some of the markings of 
	the Rossu Morta. He was not one of those soldiers we saw.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso knew better than to turn to look, or even respond. He knew that his 
	Master was testing him to see if he would forget his discipline. He had been 
	given the responsibility to watch his Master's back, and previous 
	apprentices had met unfortunate fates simply from forgetting themselves for 
	a brief moment during an assigned task. Such was the bargain made, in 
	exchange for training that could be found nowhere else on Dereth...<br>
	<br>
	Behind him, he could sense, but not see, that his Master had finished his 
	inspection and stood up. Still, he did not turn or let down his guard. He 
	only allowed himself to relax when the familiar voice of command spoke: 
	&quot;Very well, Adso, you can come off guard. I am pleased.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso grinned with fierce, hot pride, then quickly erased the expression from 
	his face before turning to his Master.<br>
	<br>
	His Master watched him carefully, and Adso suddenly knew that it had been a 
	futile effort to conceal his proud reaction. A thought came unbidden to his 
	mind, that he should not have to suffer for being proud of his abilities. 
	This, too, his Master seemed to read in his expression, or his posture. He 
	did not believe the whispered stories that the man could read minds.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You are right to be proud of yourself, Adso. Your only flaw was in how you 
	masked the set of your shoulders and the tension in your arms. We haven't 
	gone over those techniques in formal training yet. I am not angry, but 
	remember that every second spent congratulating yourself is a second in 
	which you are not focused on the task at hand. Now, my precocious student... 
	what's on your mind?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ridiculously relieved, the young scout allowed himself a glance at the 
	corpse.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Who killed him, Master? Was it the Living Shadow?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Not in the sense you might be thinking, Adso. This one had made his 
	pilgrimage to the Hopeslayer's altar, and even more strangely, his armor had 
	some splatters on it, which... smelled like the vapors of the Black Breath. 
	But the wounds did not come from the hands of the Shadow's monsters. It was 
	a more ordinary death – killed by another Isparian. I recognize the wounds 
	made by Weeping Weapons.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	His Master paused for a moment of thought, then went on. &quot;His killer, 
	however, did not stay to loot the victim. I suppose there were others 
	fighting here, and the killer did not have the luxury of time to enjoy his 
	killing rights. That was lucky for us... this one didn't fight with a 
	Weeping Weapon. His weapon is much more interesting than that. The weapon 
	had been carefully and lovingly constructed by the owner himself.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso did not have to ask to realize that his Master would already have taken 
	the weapon and put it away, to be analyzed later by some of their 
	associates. He had other questions.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Was it a struggle between the Rossu Morta and these Whispering Blade 
	warriors?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	At that, his Master shrugged. &quot;Who knows why people fight now? It may well 
	have been some kind of assassins' fight, but I don't see enough evidence of 
	traps to really think that. Maybe it was personal. Just belonging to the 
	Rossu Morta marks the victim as someone more likely to find himself in 
	deadly combat.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I don't know much about the Rossu Morta, Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's enough to know that they had a bloody reputation on Ispar, and that 
	the reputation was well earned. Still, they're not mindless brutes. Some of 
	them can still be useful. Especially for their access to certain 
	archives...&quot; His Master's smile was sharp and amused. Adso had come to know 
	that, from time to time, the man could not help but congratulate himself on 
	his own cunning, and he had to believe that this was just such a situation.<br>
	<br>
	His Master went on: &quot;The thing to remember about them is that they are a lot 
	more independent than they have ever let on to the Kings they've served. I 
	doubt that Varicci, in his unhealthy obsession, realizes just how much 
	trouble he's bought himself by reconstituting the Ordina.&quot; Adso knew that 
	hearing this kind of sensitive information was a sign of great trust. He 
	could also tell that he'd been told as much as he would be told... For now.<br>
	<br>
	Master and student both looked north, their attention captured by a blinking 
	light on the horizon. It was a signal from one of Adso's fellow students, a 
	less accomplished scout. The pattern of light flashes indicated that the 
	other acolyte had found something of urgent interest.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, your lesser brother thinks we ought to hurry.&quot; Adso nodded, and the 
	both of them shouldered their packs.<br>
	<br>
	Adso glanced at his Master's pack and noticed something extremely odd. The 
	thick leather of the pack and its various flaps and covers could not conceal 
	the bulbous head of a strange figurine, or the red glow projecting from its 
	eyes.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Master, forgive my indiscretion, but what is that thing with the glowing 
	eyes?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	His Master stopped and let out a soft sigh, then turned and opened the pack. 
	Inside, on top of the rest of his Master's meticulously organized 
	belongings, Adso saw a small doll, shaped like the magically animated 
	Mosswart idols of the coastal jungles, with a glowing sigil on its chest. It 
	was stuffed like a child's toy. Despite the glowing red eyes, it looked... 
	cute. Like a child's toy. Adso would have been less shocked if he'd seen 
	Asheron's severed head peeking out from his Master's pack.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The victim also carried this,&quot; his Master explained, almost sheepishly. &quot;It 
	is unusual enough that I took it for examination. Who knows what strange 
	secrets it holds? And it reminds me of the stuffed cloth bears that were a 
	common toy among Aluvian children. You probably don't even know what a bear 
	looks like, Adso. Come on, now. We have a summons to answer.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso followed after his Master in a run, covering blasted ground with 
	silent, efficient strides. Try as he might, he had just learned that there 
	was something of a sentimental spirit in his ruthless and efficient Master, 
	after all. It made him admire the man more... and made him wary that this 
	knowledge, this unexpected encounter with his Master's softer side, had 
	probably reduced the chances that he would survive this apprenticeship.</span></p>

	March 15, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">A dusty, travel-stained man with the brawny build of a 
	smith stopped, sighing, in front of the Smoking Axe tavern of Ayan Baqur. He 
	wiped a thick layer of sweat from the flushed blue skin of his brow. He 
	turned and noticed an old man, standing quietly in the shade of the tavern 
	and nursing a cool mug of beer.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pardon me, sir,&quot; the smith said, stepping over to introduce himself. The 
	old man turned, looked around, then turned back to the smith with a vaguely 
	confused look.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Sir? Who? What? You mean me?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Uh, well, yes. It is a common form of address here, is it not?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Polite, yes. Common, no.&quot; The old man took a sip from his mug, wiped some 
	foam from his lips, and gave a short, if wobbly, bow. &quot;I'm Ulgrim. I'm the 
	man to know around these parts.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The smith bowed back. &quot;A pleasure to meet you, sir. Ulgrim. Sir. I do seek 
	knowledgeable locals. My name is Iian di Alduressa, and I am newly arrived 
	to this realm.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, welcome to Ayan Baqur then, Iian. Viamontian, are you? We don't get 
	many Viamontians in these parts.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Iian nodded slowly. &quot;I understand that there is a war going on between my 
	King and the Queen of the people of the mainland... Is it unsafe for me 
	here?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Unsafe? No... Well, no more unsafe for you than it is for anyone else 
	around here. No, we just don't get many Viamontians in Ayan Baqur because 
	the desert sun turns your skin a most unfashionable shade of purple. Makes 
	you look like Tumeroks, especially if you're not in the habit of shaving.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I see... That is useful information...&quot; Iian shook his head, trying to 
	clear his thoughts. &quot;I was wondering if you could tell me how to find some 
	people...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, I can tell you about some people you shouldn't be looking for! There 
	are these people, you see, who have sworn their souls to a dark power, and 
	get their jollies from killing other people for fun and profit. You can tell 
	by the faint reddish aura around them, and all the jewelry and expensive 
	things they like to carry around with them. Like they're looking to leave 
	behind a fancy-looking corpse. Those folks have been going Mite-squeak crazy 
	lately. It's like mating season for murderers!&quot; Ulgrim waved his mug around 
	for emphasis, sloshing dark, foamy stout on Iian's dusty boots.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ah, yes, I see. That, too, is a valuable insight. But you see, on Ispar I 
	was a royal armorsmith, and I am looking for some armorsmiths of some renown 
	in this realm, who have mastered the art of fusing crystals to metal...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim interrupted again, to point at a woman lounging near the tavern 
	entrance, on the other side of the door. &quot;Speaking of people... You see her? 
	Lydda? She tells people she's a plumber, but I know she's not. The reason I 
	know is that some of Berkholt's taps have broken, and she hasn't done a 
	thing to help fix them. She's up to something shady, I can tell. But does 
	anyone believe old Ulgrim, no matter how many times I've been proven right? 
	No ho ho! And then the Virindi take over and their brains get turned to 
	applesauce! Applesauce, I tell you!&quot; More stout sloshed from the wildly 
	swung mug, this time splattering on Ulgrim's robe. The old man had a wild 
	look in his eyes, and this time the foam around his mouth was not from his 
	beer.<br>
	<br>
	The woman Ulgrim had identified as Lydda turned, looked at them, and rolled 
	her eyes. She was obviously used to these accusatory outbursts from Ulgrim.<br>
	<br>
	Iian retreated, bowing repeatedly as he stepped backwards. &quot;Thank you for 
	your time, sir. I shall take your wise words to heart.&quot; Once he'd gotten a 
	few steps away, he turned and walked quickly, headed for the nearest portal. 
	&quot;I may as well just head back home,&quot; he muttered. &quot;These mainland Isparians 
	have gone crazy.&quot; He had intended to step into the tavern for a cool drink, 
	but was beginning to think that the beer here was tainted with some kind of 
	mind-warping solution. He didn't want to end up like the infamous Duke Raoul 
	of Viamont.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim watched the smith scurrying away and shook a fist at him. &quot;Hey! You 
	could at least buy an old man a mug of stout for all the help I gave you!&quot; 
	He shook his head. &quot;What a rude and snooty young man. Just like his King. I 
	wouldn't have wanted to introduce him to the Shadow Armor smiths anyway.&quot;</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><b>New content and Functionality</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">There is a rumor floating around Dereth that a 
		smith who can craft Viamontian Shadow Armor may be somewhere in Dereth. 
		From what has been told, he is not quite ready to begin crafting the 
		armor yet. His goal this month appears to be collecting information. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The temples of Forgetfulness and Enlightenment 
		both now have the option for players to turn in unused tokens that may 
		have been mistakenly picked up to an NPC. They will then be able to pick 
		up another token in its place. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">We have split up the timers on the attribute gems 
		so that players can not make the mistake of picking up 18 of one type of 
		token. Players can now only pick up 9 of the un-train and train tokens 
		respectively. As a side effect of this change, all players will have 
		their timers reset for changing attributes. This will not affect the 
		timers on skill changes. Players will be able to keep all of the tokens 
		they already have.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The books in the temples of Enlightenment and 
		Forgetfulness have been updated to reflect all of the recent changes to 
		the temples.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">A language filter has been added into the game 
		this month. It can be activated in the character options section of your 
		user interface. While we know this filter won't catch everything, it 
		will allow those people who do not want to see certain words, the 
		ability to filter them out. We do want to be clear this is not a 
		substitute for reporting language to customer service. If you see 
		someone using profanity we still encourage everyone to report the 
		offending person. This filter is simply a means to help reduce the 
		visibility of these words to those people who do not wish to see them.
		<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">We have made a lot of changes to help improve PvP 
		this month. Including damage changes and the ability to make loot 
		generated weapons un-enchantable. You can read more about these changes
		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=447">here</a>. 
		We are really excited about these changes and we feel they are helping 
		us move in the right direction. We will continue to take in all feedback 
		on these improvements and make changes based on that feedback. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">A shadowy pair of figures arrive in Dereth this 
		month, promising the ability to help players erase any evidence of their 
		previous service to either Elysa or Varicci. They are essentially 
		offering to knock a player's Loyalty record back to zero, so they would 
		be free to start over on the questing ladder and choose to serve a 
		different monarch. Of course, this service comes at a price, and the 
		mysterious agents will only risk interfering with royal records once per 
		character. Any Loyalty quests introduced after this month will be beyond 
		the power of the agents to erase, so there will be a point (coming 
		soon!) at which a player's Loyalty will be permanent.</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><b>Miscellaneous Changes and Improvements</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">After some changes were made to rares system, we 
		found that non Throne of Destiny players were also getting rares. There 
		was also an issue where PK Deaths had a chance to generate a rare on 
		Death. These have both been fixed for March. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Ciandra has had some typos fixed in her speech 
		regarding the Essences of Magic quest.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Minor and Major Salvaging have been surpassing 
		Alchemy spells of the same strength. This has been fixed for March. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Players were reporting that after they put down 
		their Rose of Celdon ring they could not longer pick it up. This has 
		been fixed. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">On the Glenden Wood Invasion part II players were 
		only getting the minimum reward they were qualified for, even though 
		they were eligible to get the higher level reward. This has been fixed 
		and players should now get the proper rewards for this quest. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">All characters on the account of a character who 
		owns a house will have greater permissions involving house management. 
		These characters will be able to add and remove guests, add and remove 
		storage permissions, open and close the house, boot freeloaders, and 
		even place items on the house's hooks. There are only two things that a 
		non-owner character on the same account can't do with a house: abandon

		<li><span lang="en-us">We've also made some changes to the command

	</font>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the 
	March Letter to the Players!<br>
	<br>
	We have seen some exciting changes over the past few months as Dereth 
	continues to evolve and change. We've seen the beginning of the PvP 
	improvements that we have been discussing with the community, as well as 
	some new character options such as the title panel. What is in store for us 
	this month? Let's get right to it and find out! <br>
	<br>
	<b>Decisions, Decisions!</b><br>
	The storyline continues this month with more decision-based quests. What 
	decisions will you make? Make sure you make the right choices when deciding 
	which side of the war you want to be on. Every decision we make has 
	consequences.<br>
	<br>
	<b>PvP Combat</b><br>
	After soliciting extensive feedback from the PvP community, this month we 
	have made the first set of changes aimed at improving the PvP experience. 
	You can read more about these changes here:
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=447">PVP Changes</a>. 
	We are really excited about these changes and we can't wait to see what you 
	think of them in action. We will of course continue to review all your 
	feedback on these improvements and make tweaks based on that feedback. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Temple Revision</b><br>
	Since we revised the Temples of Forgetfulness and Enlightenment in December, 
	they have suffered from some minor usability issues. In order to correct 
	those issues, we have made two small changes to the temples. <br>
	<br>
	First, both temples now contain an NPC who would be happy to take any unused 
	tokens that you may have mistakenly picked up. This NPC will also decrement 
	your quest flags so that you will then be able to pick up another – 
	hopefully correct – token in its place. <br>
	<br>
	In addition, we have split up the timers on the attribute gems so that 
	players can no longer make the fatal mistake of picking up 18 of one type of 
	token. Players can now only pick up 9 untrain tokens and 9 train tokens at 
	once. As a side effect of this change, all players will have their attribute 
	token timers reset with the March update. Players will also be able to keep 
	any attribute tokens that they may have already had. This change will not 
	affect the timers on skill tokens at all. <br>
	<br>
	And finally, the books in the Temples of Enlightenment and Forgetfulness 
	have been updated to reflect all of the recent changes to the temples. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Language Filter</b><br>
	In response to your requests, we have added a simple language filter this 
	month. This filter can be activated in the character options section of your 
	user interface. It is off by default. When the filter is on, vulgar words 
	that appear in any kind of chat – including tells, fellowship chat, global 
	chats, and indeed every other kind of game chat – will be masked with 
	asterisks. <br>
	<br>
	We want to be very clear about something: this filter is not a substitute 
	for customer service. If you see someone using profanity, please report them 
	and we will do our best to solve the problem. This filter is simply a means 
	to help reduce the visibility of these words to those people who do not wish 
	to see them in the meantime. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Housing Improvements</b><br>
	Starting with the March update, all characters on the account of a character 
	who owns a house will have greater permissions involving house management. 
	These characters will be able to add and remove guests, add and remove 
	storage permissions, open and close the house, boot freeloaders, and even 
	place items on the house's hooks. There are only two things that a non-owner 
	character on the same account can't do with a house: abandon the house, and 
	change the allegiance permissions. In addition, other characters on your 
	account will be automatically removed from the house guest list the first 
	time they log in, thus making more space for legitimate guests. <br>
	<br>
	We've also made some changes to the command @house available, which lists 
	how many houses of each type and available for purchase and the locations of 
	the houses (except apartments). First off, we added a shorter alias for 
	@house available, called @hslist. Secondly, this command now takes as a 
	parameter the type of house you'd like to list. For instance, @hslist villa 
	will show you a list of only the available villas, while @hslist mansion 
	will show you only mansions. Keep in mind that the list of results is still 
	limited to 400 houses, however, so if there are more than 400 cottages 
	available you will only see the first 400 locations. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In-Concept</b><br>
	Based on feedback from players as well as members of the team, we are going 
	to be revising this section of the Letter to the Players. Starting next 
	month, when we list items in this section they will come with some 
	explaination as to what each item is. So instead of just listing the things 
	we want to do, we will list them with a description of each item. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Please remeber that along with everything that is listed here, there are 
	several new quests and other new and exciting things going into the game for 
	the March event. <br>
	<br>
	So that's what's in store for March! We're excited about this month, and we 
	look forward to your

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=447">Turbine Site</a>, 
	March 10, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Some months ago, we started intensive research into 
	ways that we could improve the PvP experience in Asheron's Call. PvP is an 
	important aspect of the game and players who regularly engage in PvP combat 
	make up a significant portion of our subscribers. The PvP experience in 
	Asheron's Call isn't terrible by any means, but there is definite room for 
	improvement.<br>
	<br>
	We started by identifying the major issues with PvP based on player 
	feedback. We quickly found that we could largely divide these issues into 
	two broad categories:</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">PvP fights can be much too long and tedious.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">PvP combat does not have a larger purpose in the 
		world. In other words, PvP players want something meaningful to fight 
		over. </span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us">These are both broad and complex issues and we wanted 
	to make sure that we handled them carefully, not in a slipshod fashion. So 
	we decided to start with the first issue and see what progress we could make 
	there before we tackled the second issue. <br>
	<br>
	We began our effort to make PvP fights less tedious by putting together a 
	series of proposals – things that we could do with our technology that might 
	help the situation – and then running those ideas past players for their 
	feedback, both on our forums and elsewhere. After an awful lot of quality 
	feedback from the PvP community and several rounds of tuning our ideas, we 
	arrived at the following list of first-pass changes that will be going live 
	with the March update.<br>
	<br>
	First off, we will be increasing the damage on PvP-oriented quest weapons. 
	This includes the Weeping weapons, the Phantom weapons, the Deadly Hollow 
	melee weapons and the Hollow missile weapons. We have also added a system 
	that allows imbued loot weapons to be much more damaging when used in PvP 
	combat (both PK and PKL) without affecting their PvE effectiveness. This 
	includes Armor Rending, Resistance Rending of all varieties, Critical 
	Strike, and Crippling Blow imbues on all melee, missile, and magic caster 
	loot weapons (except that AR can't be used with magic casters, of course). 
	Together, these changes should allow all PvP combatants to do damage to 
	their opponents more effectively, and should reduce the length and tedium of 
	PvP fights. <br>
	<br>
	There's more, but before we go any further let's have a word about these 
	damage increases. Our methodology here was pretty simple. We increased the 
	damage on the Weeping weapons by 10-20% (depending on weapon type), and then 
	increased the damage on the other weapons until the ratio of their damage to 
	Weeping damage was where we wanted it. We mostly preserved the existing 
	balance between Weeping weapons of different types, although casters got a 
	slightly smaller increase and staff and mace saw the largest increases. In 
	general, Hollow and Phantom weapons are more effective than Weeping weapons 
	in specific situations, but not as good in other situations. Imbued loot 
	weapons are 5-15% more damaging that Weeping weapons in general, although in 
	specific situations they can exceed those numbers (Crippling Blow critical 
	hits, for instance).<br>
	<br>
	But that paragraph hides an awful lot of complexity. When we were deciding 
	how much to increase damage on weapons, we had to look at a variety of 
	numbers. Some of the major indicators we used were: the damage on a critical 
	hit; the damage on a normal, non-critical hit; and the average damage per 
	second. For each of these numbers, we also looked at how they differed based 
	on various opponents. For instance, how much damage was done against a 
	partially buffed opponent? A fully buffed and baned opponent? A fully buffed 
	opponent debuffed with Imperil only? Debuffed with Imperil and vulnerability 
	spells? And of course we also looked at the effects of different base armor 
	levels and compared these to the most commonly used equipment in PvP today.
	<br>
	<br>
	It gets even more complicated when comparing different types of weapons to 
	each other. For instance, a Phantom weapon ignores all armor – and therefore 
	is not affected by Impenetrability or bane spells – but its damage is 
	affected by life protection and vulnerability spells. So a Phantom weapon 
	will generally be more effective on a heavily-armored opponent who is not at 
	all debuffed. But against the same opponent debuffed with Imperial and 
	Vulnerability spells, the Weeping weapon will often be more effective. In 
	other words, many weapons are quite situational. We wanted to make those 
	weapons superior in their given situations without making any one weapon 
	always superior – but at the same time make sure that all weapons were at 
	least somewhat effective, and always more effective than before. <br>
	<br>
	So, while we have given you very general ranges for how much we improved 
	weapon damage, please understand that these can be very situational. <br>
	<br>
	Now, in addition to the extra damage we also added some other interesting 
	abilities. For missile combat specifically we've added two new character 
	options: Lead Missile Targets and Use Fast Missiles. Both of these options 
	are available to all players, both PvP and PvE.<br>
	<br>
	The Lead Missile Targets option is on by default, so it matches previous 
	missile behavior. When this option is on and you fire a missile launcher 
	such as a bow, crossbow, or atlatl, the game will aim at where it expects 
	the target to be when the missile arrives at the target. In other words, you 
	will lead the target. When this option is toggled off, however, firing a 
	missile launcher will fire the missile at where the target is now, not where 
	the server expects the target to be in a few seconds. This will make it much 
	harder to dodge arrows merely by gently strafing back and forth. And because 
	it is a character option, it can be mapped to a key press. Then PvP archers 
	can switch this behavior on and off at will to better react to the movements 
	of their enemies. <br>
	<br>
	The option to Use Fast Missiles is off by default, which matches the 
	previous behavior for PvE. When this option is turned on, missiles do not 
	fire from the launcher any more frequently, but once they are fired they fly 
	through the air faster and with less arc. PvP players have seen this effect 
	before on the PvP-oriented quest missile weapons. But now all players will 
	have the option to turn this behavior on and off with any missile launcher. 
	And because this option can be mapped to a key press, PvP archers can again 
	switch this behavior on and off at will to better react to the movements of 
	their enemies.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, an addition to the Cells of the Black Book dungeon in March will 
	allow players to make a loot weapon un-enchantable. An un-enchantable weapon 
	will still benefit from any inherent spells, but can't be buffed or debuffed 
	by any player or outside agency. <br>
	<br>
	So, to sum up, in the March update we: </span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Increased damage on PvP-oriented quest weapons.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Increased damage on imbued loot weapons when they 
		are used in PvP combat only. </span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Added two new character options for missile 
		combat that will help archers vary their attacks and make dodging 
		missiles more interesting. </span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Added an interaction to make loot weapons un-enchantable.
		</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us">And that's what we have in store in the March update 
	for PvP! We will be carefully monitoring how these plans play out in real 
	live situations, of course, and we'll be ready to make tweaks based on 
	feedback from the PvP community. If this goes well, we will also start the 
	planning and initial feedback phase for changes and systems aimed at giving 
	PvP a meaningful purpose in the world. <br>
	<br>
	We wouldn't have been able to put these plans together without copious 
	high-quality feedback from you, our players. Thank you. We hope that we can 
	continue working together to make AC1 the best it's ever been. <br>
