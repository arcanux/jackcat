	<p>
    Two youths perched on the top of a ridge. Though they were young, not yet 
	fully grown, they had the broad shoulders and thick limbs of Aluvian 
	mountain folk. The bows they clutched in trembling hands were huge and 
	thick, requiring enormous strength to pull properly. They were crouched 
	down, trying to remain hidden behind a rock formation, and spying on a 
	gathering of warriors in the valley far below.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;They didn't find our trail,&quot; said the younger one, Matthias, with obvious 
	relief.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;See, I told you,&quot; said his brother, Jedeth. &quot;We've been hunting Gromnies 
	and Siraluun in these parts for years, we got the advantage on these big, 
	clanking brutes. They don't know their way around our land. Especially not 
	at dusk, when there's not that much light and a body's eyes haven't adjusted 
	to the dark yet.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Matthias, now more calm, turned contemplative. &quot;You ever seen any man that 
	big?&quot; he asked, as they watched the squad of monstrous Viamontian Knights on 
	the valley floor, standing around the corpses of two of their friends. 
	Red-fletched arrows perforated the chests of the two fallen Knights.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Papa used to talk about how tough it was to fight Ferran Knights, in the 
	Viamontian Wars back home on Ispar. But they were just men, same size as us. 
	And Count Tenera, when he told us that these new Knights weren't Ferrans, 
	but worse, and ten feet tall... Well, it's one thing to hear it, and another 
	thing to see it. And to have to shoot at it while it's waving a sword as big 
	as you are.&quot; He paused, and looked at his younger brother. &quot;I won't lie to 
	you, Matty, I felt a powerful fear when we sprung that trap. My hands were 
	shaking when we attacked. Still are shaking. It's lucky we got them both.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Matthias put a comforting hand on his brother's shoulder. &quot;I was scared too, 
	Jed. But we did good. The plan worked. And we'll only keep getting better, 
	as we get in more practice killing them Knights.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Down below, a smaller figure had joined the armored brutes. He, too, was 
	armored, but of normal human size, and issuing orders to the great soldiers. 
	He was clearly some kind of officer among these Viamontian invaders.<br>
	<br>
	Jedeth pointed. &quot;Look, there, a guy our size, in armor. What'd Tenera tell 
	us about them?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He said they were the magic types,&quot; said Matthias. &quot;That we'd better make 
	the first shot count, because they could hit us from far away.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yeah, that's what I thought I remembered,&quot; said Jedeth. &quot;This one may be 
	more clever than them others, but he isn't that smart. He's not wearing a 
	helmet.&quot; He drew another red-fletched arrow from his quiver. This one, 
	however, had the word &quot;Carenzi&quot; painted on the shaft, in vivid red letters 
	to match the fletching.<br>
	<br>
	Matthias drew a similar arrow from his quiver. Both brothers moved quietly 
	from their spying position behind the rock formation to a low crouch on 
	either side of it. With great care, each nocked an arrow. &quot;On three,&quot; Jedeth 
	whispered.<br>
	<br>
	They lifted their bows, pulled the strings slowly back as the thick wooden 
	weapons creaked softly, and then aimed. &quot;One... two... three.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Two soft twangs went off, and a heartbeat later, the Viamontian mage had two 
	quivering arrows sprouting from his forehead. He toppled stiffly to the 
	ground. The cluster of warriors looked up at where the arrows must have come 
	from, but only saw rocks and empty ridgeline. Three of them broke from the 
	formation and charged up the ridge at terrifying speed, but by the time they 
	reached the rock formation, there was no sign of the brothers' passing.<br>
	<br>
	******<br>
	<br>
	King Varicci II stepped over the armored bulk of a dead Viamontian Knight 
	and looked down on the dead mage. He bent to yank one of the arrows out of 
	the corpse's forehead. He turned the bloodstained arrow over in his hands 
	and saw the word painted on the shaft.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Carenzi,&quot; he read. Varicci turned to his companion, Commander Enrico di 
	Bellenesse. &quot;What is this Carenzi?&quot; he asked.<br>
	<br>
	Enrico glanced at the arrow. &quot;A small animal... like a badger from Ispar, 
	but terribly ferocious. They are common on this island. It seems the local 
	resistance has taken them as some sort of symbol. A cache of weapons 
	recently went missing from a storeroom. There was similar writing on the 
	storeroom's broken door.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The people of the towns have come to their senses and are cooperating, but 
	these Carenzi...&quot; The King's face twisted in disgust. &quot;They are probably 
	Aluvian gutterfolk, again unable to accept conquest by Viamont. They are 
	beasts, Enrico. You will have to kill every one of them.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Enrico nodded stiffly. &quot;Yes, Majesty. It will be done.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The King put his hand on Enrico's armored shoulder and regarded the soldier 
	with a cool and appraising eye. &quot;We must have a quick pacification of this 
	island so we can dispatch forces to the new land, Enrico. I cannot have 
	these Carenzi rebels bleeding off my soldiers one and two at a time, not 
	when there is such a pressing need to investigate this place called Vissidal.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I have not heard much of Vissidal, Majesty, since I have been so occupied 
	with the campaign on this island. What has happened?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It is an island that apparently has risen from the deeps of the ocean. We 
	don't know what buried it, or what caused it to come to the surface again. 
	But there is good reason to believe that at least some of the knowledge I 
	seek is to be found there.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;May I ask, Majesty, what knowledge you seek on that distant island?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci smiled, his eyes glittering in the early evening moonlight. &quot;The way 
	to achieve true and final victory, my dear trusted friend. On Vissidal and 
	elsewhere, I seek a way to destroy the only advantage of poor Elysa's ragtag 
	army of Bloodless mongrels.&quot;<br>

	<p>Ardry stepped out of the woods to behold the great stone battlements of 
	the bandit chief MacDugal's fortress.&nbsp; He had a passing acquaintance with 
	the inhabitants of the castle, and stopped by occasionally, when he was 
	ranging in the area and needed to restock supplies.&nbsp; He approached and 
	greeted the man who sat, trembling, by the front gate.</p>
	<p>&quot;What news, Karwin?&quot; he called.</p>
	<p>Karwin scrambled to his feet.&nbsp; &quot;Got any beer?&nbsp; They stole my beer.&nbsp; It 
	stole my beer.&nbsp; Darned thing, never thought to see another one again&amp;&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry held up his hands to slow Karwin's feverish speech.</p>
	<p>&quot;What?&nbsp; Who stole your beer?&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;A little green thing.&nbsp; Looked like&amp; Well, Mosswarty.&nbsp; Very suspiciously 
	Mosswarty.&nbsp; But blue!&nbsp; Like the sea&amp;&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;A Mosswart stole your beer?&quot;&nbsp; Ardry had heard many tall claims from 
	Karwin before.</p>
	<p>&quot;It wasn't a proper Mosswart, but that's right enough.&nbsp; He said he was 
	from an island to the northeast.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he smelled like the sea!&nbsp; The sea, 
	and beer.&nbsp; Which he stole.&nbsp; The beer that is, not the sea.&quot;&nbsp; Karwin nodded 
	very enthusiastically to punctuate his point.</p>
	<p>&quot;Karwin, there's no island to the northeast.&nbsp; There is only the ancient 
	foundry island, north by northwest of here.&quot;</p>
	<p>Karwin ignored him and pressed on with his story.&nbsp; &quot;He smelled of the 
	sea, and of beer, and he said that his god, who he named Angry Grandfather, 
	wanted him to search all over for beer and come back to their island in the 
	northeast!&quot;</p>
	<p>&quot;Karwin, I am telling you, there is only the island of Aerlinthe, north 
	by northwest&amp;&quot;&nbsp; He was interrupted by Karwin's furious babble.</p>
	<p>&quot;Didn't you feel the rumble?&nbsp; Didn't it make you stumble?&nbsp; Nights ago, 
	who remembers when?&nbsp; But something has come up which once was deep!&nbsp; And 
	before that, it was up again!&nbsp; To get there, you must pass the Watchers and 
	go underneath the Leviathan!&quot;</p>
	<p>Ardry shook his head.&nbsp; &quot;I'm heading in to resupply, Karwin.&nbsp; I'll bring 
	you some food on my way out.&quot;&nbsp; He did remember the shaking of the earth, 
	just three nights past.&nbsp; He'd assumed that it had been another eruption on 
	Aerlinthe, but he tried to remember the sensations of that night as best he 
	could&amp; And now, to think about it, the rolling waves of tremors <i>had</i> 
	seemed to come from the northeast&amp;</p>
	<p>An hour later, Ardry stood on the shore northeast of Macdugal's castle, 
	his pack bulging with fresh supplies.&nbsp; He looked out over the sea, and 
	sighed.&nbsp; &quot;That lunatic was right after all.&quot;</p>

	<p><b>SEPTEMBER LETTER TO THE PLAYERS<br>
	</b>Welcome to the September Letter to the Players! We've got quite a large 
	event in store for all of you this month. The September Event, &quot;Under Cover 
	of Night&quot; marks some dangerous times for the Dereth, but also includes some 
	new improvements players can use to defeat their adversaries. This event is 
	currently scheduled for Wednesday, September 21st.</p>
	<p><b>COMING SOON<br>
	</b>(These are the items we plan to implement for the September Event)</p>
	<p><b>GLOBAL CHAT<br>
	</b>&nbsp;Global Chat marks a significant upgrade to Asheron Call's chat system. 
	The Global Chat system&nbsp;will include four new chat channels – General, Trade, 
	Looking For Group, and Roleplay.</p>
	<p><b>General<br>
	</b>The General channel is an all-purpose channel that allows all players of 
	Asheron's Call to chat with each other about any aspect of Asheron's Call.
	</p>
	<p><b>Trade<br>
	</b>The Trade channel exists specifically for players to advertise their 
	wares to each other and to arrange trades.</p>
	<p><b>Looking For Group<br>
	</b>This channel exists specifically to help players find others to join 
	them for in-game activities.</p>
	<p><b>Roleplay<br>
	</b>The Roleplay channel allows players who enjoy roleplaying their 
	characters a place to chat in-character, arrange roleplaying activities, and 
	meet likeminded individuals. Note that this channel does not receive any 
	special enforcement.</p>
	<p><i>Joining and Leaving the Channel<br>
	</i>All channels can be joined and/or left in one of two ways:</p>
	<p>Through a checkbox in the Character Settings tab of the Options UI Panel. 
	Note that this change takes effect as soon as the checkbox is used; the 
	Apply button does not need to be pressed before this change takes effect.</p>
	<p>Through a text command:</p>
	<p>/join <br>
	/leave <CHANNEL name="" /></p>
	<p>The text command is just a shortcut to the UI checkbox, and it sets the 
	checkbox as appropriate. The player will see a confirmation message in their 
	chat area when they have entered or left a channel that looks like this:</p>
	<p>You have [joinedleft] the [tag] channel.</p>
	<p>See the Global Chat Channel Summary below for channel names and tags. </p>
	<p>Players are automatically joined to any channels that they have checked 
	when they login, and they will also see the join messages on login. </p>
	<p><i>Talking in the Channel<br>
	</i>Players can prefix any text they wish to send to the channel with the 
	command symbol (/ or @) and the channel name. For instance, the following 
	will send the message to the trade channel. </p>
	<p>@ct I have Elysa's Crystal that I'm willing to trade for 4 MMDs!</p>
	<p>In addition, players can also set their Chat Bar menu so that everything 
	they type without a prefix automatically goes to the selected channel. </p>
	<p>You may also join or leave a channel by selecting it from your Character 
	Options panel, under Chat.</p>
	<p>Note that players can only send text to a channel if they are currently 
	listening to it. Players who attempt to send text to a channel that they are 
	not listening to will see the message:</p>
	<p>You may not speak on that channel because you are not currently listening 
	to it.</p>
	<p>When a player receives text from a global channel, that text will be 
	prefixed by a channel tag (detailed below) and the name of the character who 
	sent the text. For instance, other players listening to the trade channel 
	when I sent the text above will see:</p>
	<p>[Trade] Mor'gan says, &quot;I have Elysa's Crystal that I'm willing to trade 
	for 4 MMDs!&quot;</p>
	<p>All global channels will display in the same text color: a kind of 
	blue-grey. </p>
	<p><i>Squelching<br>
	</i>Squelching rules apply to text in global chat channels in the same way 
	that they apply to text sent in open local chat (&quot;says&quot;). That is, if I have 
	a character is explicitly squelched, I will never see anything that that 
	character says. If I have the character's account squelched, I will not see 
	things that other characters on that account say as well. </p>
	<p>We will also be increasing the maximum characters/accounts that can be 
	squelched at once from 32 to 64.</p>

	<p><i>Chat Windows<br>
	</i>We are also adding some new functionality to the chat window to help 
	players better manage the new chat channels. This new functionality can best 
	be described as: extra floating chat windows and filtering the text that 
	displays in those windows. </p>
	<p>In short, we are adding four buttons to the resize bar of the current 
	(main) chat window. Clicking on each of these buttons will toggle a floating 
	chat window that can be dragged around the 3D area and resized at will. The 
	size and position of each window will be saved for each character. The 
	floating chat windows are translucent; in normal circumstances, items can be 
	selected through the window, and hovering the mouse over the chat window 
	will darken it and cause it to intercept mouse clicks. </p>
	<p>By default, all text types are displayed in the main chat window and no 
	chat types are displayed in the floating windows. The player can, however, 
	open the new Chat tab in the Options panel to select which types of chat 
	display in which windows. Players may choose to display the following types 
	of text in any (or no) windows:</p>
	<p>-Area Chat (@say, @emote)<br>
	-Private Chat (@tell)<br>
	-Fellowship<br>
	-Allegiance (includes Allegiance Broadcast)<br>
	-General<br>
	-Trade<br>
	-LFG<br>
	-Roleplay<br>
	-Combat (not including magic)<br>
	-Magic</p>
	<p>Gameplay (includes Recall, Craft, Advancement, Housing and System 
	Messages, etc – anything which is not communication from another player or 
	Combat/Magic)</p>
	<p>The Gameplay category will always display in the main window (unless 
	individual components are filtered by the @filter command). In this way we 
	guarantee that you cannot accidentally miss important system messages more 
	easily than they can now. The Gameplay category can be turned on or off in 
	the floating windows, however. </p>
	<p>Note that this functionality is in addition to the existing text 
	filtering capabilities. The UI does not replace the @filter command, because 
	we do not want to remove functionality that many of you rely on. In 
	addition, @filter allows players to filter out subtypes within the &quot;Other&quot; 
	category. </p>
	<p>In addition, players can also adjust the active and inactive opacity of 
	the floating chat windows in the new Chat options tab (although note that 
	this slider controls all four floating windows at once; it is not a 
	window-by-window control). </p>
	<p><i>Expanded Chat Commands<br>
	</i>In an effort to make the chat system more user-friendly, we are adding a 
	number of new commands for existing chat types that mimic other games. We 
	have added an @w command that maps to private chat (@tell). Note that all of 
	these new and existing commands will be listed by the @help command. </p>
	<p>And, to make the system less confusing, we consolidated the format of 
	communication in several channels to better indicate to players how they can 
	respond. The following table illustrates these changes. </p>

	<p><i>Click Name to Tell<br>
	</i>This feature makes communication easier for players. Players will be 
	able to click on the name of another player when that name appears in the 
	chat window as the originator of communication, and the following will 
	happen:</p>
	<p>The chat entry bar will gain focus</p>
	<p>The text &quot;@tell <CLICKED name="" character="" />, &quot; will appear in the 
	chat entry bar (minus quotes).</p>
	<p>The cursor will be at the end of this text, so that the clicking player 
	can immediately continue with a private message to the clicked character.
	</p>
	<p>Note that this system does not currently work in the allegiance, general, 
	trade, looking for group, or roleplay chat channels. We may add this 
	functionality in a future update.</p>
	<p><b>NEW LANDMASS – VISSIDAL ISLAND<br>
	</b>The new island for September is called Vissidal, or &quot;Summer Palace&quot; in 
	the Falatacot language.&nbsp; It was once a private island retreat for Falatacot 
	royalty and nobility, before catastrophic events sank it to the ocean floor.</p>
	<p>Vissidal Island sits off the northeast coast of Dereth.&nbsp; It is shaped 
	like a long continental shelf, and seems to almost echo the shape of the 
	Derethian coast.&nbsp; In general, the island is close to sea level, but it rises 
	up to a ridge shape along most of its northern and eastern coast. </p>
	<p>There is one outpost on the island.&nbsp; Located on the western shore of the 
	island, it is </p>
	<p>Players will need to be a certain level and complete a quest before 
	gaining entry to the island. Those that venture to the island should beware 
	the Remoran!!</p>
	<p><b>TREASURE<br>
	</b>Crowns, Hats, Shoes, and Gloves spawn with much higher Armor Level can 
	now be found.</p>
	<p>We've changed elemental wands so they can be tinkered to increase their 
	elemental damage multiplier. </p>
	<p>Level 7 spells are now available as loot!</p>
	<p>In addition, several types of armor will receive modified base 
	protections.</p>
	<p><b>REFURBISHERS<br>
	</b>For those who have trophy items that lost their original art and display 
	in a partially broken state after the release of ToD we have created a new 
	NPC that will accept a number of these items and exchange them for a brand 
	new version of the same item. These NPCs can be found in Holtburg, Shoushi, 
	Yaraq, and outside Sanamar.</p>
	<p>The Refurbishers will accept the following items:</p>
	<p>-Pack Cow<br>
	-Pack Drudge<br>
	-Golden Gromnie<br>
	-Pack Golem<br>
	-Pack Grievver<br>
	-Pack Idol<br>
	-Pack Lugian<br>
	-Pack Mosswart<br>
	-Velveteen Olthoi<br>
	-Pack Scarecrow<br>
	-Plush Tusker<br>
	-Pack Ursuin<br>
	-Pack Virindi<br>
	-Mu-miyah Guise<br>
	-Mu-miyah body with a Head<br>
	-Decorative Bronze Statue<br>
	-Commemorative Bronze Statue<br>
	-Oxidized Statue<br>
	-Decorative Bronze Statue<br>

	-Decorative Bronze Statue<br>
	-Commemorative Bronze Statue<br>
	-Oxidized Statue</p>
	<p><b>DUNGEONS<br>
	</b>Due to the over crowding of the Path of the Blind hunting dungeon we 
	have created two duplicate Path of the Blind dungeons. In addition, the XP 
	rewards for the Egg Orchard and Dark Design will be adjusted upwards to be 
	comparable to Path of the Blind. </p>
	<p>Path of the Blind:&nbsp; Two copies will be made of the original Path of the 
	Blind dungeon. The entrances to these dungeons will be placed on landscape 
	somewhere on the Isle of Ruin</p>
	<p>Egg Orchard:&nbsp; Modifications to the Olthoi within will be made so that 
	they are easier to kill. This will bring up the XP over time in line with 
	the Path of the Blind. In addition, we will create two duplicate dungeons 
	similar in design to what will be done with Path of the Blind.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Dark Design:&nbsp; Again the XP earned in this dungeon will be brought more in 
	line with the Path of the We have created versions of the Mosswarts that do 
	not cast and have interspersed these versions among the chain casting 
	versions of the Mosswarts. Also, the chain casting Mosswarts will have their 
	spellbook altered to cast less war spells and debuffs. Base stats will 
	remain the same as they are already fairly easy to kill.</p>
	<p><b>NEW QUESTS<br>
	</b>A variety of new quests have been added to the game. Here is just a 
	sampling of what's to come!</p>
	<p>Gateway to the Deep - Players level 130 or above can engage in a 
	continent-spanning quest to open the portals to the new island. Once this 
	has been done, the quest serves as an initiation to gain access to the new 
	island. The initial iteration culminates in a group battle against the 
	fearsome creature!</p>
	<p>Temple of Xik Minru – Level 130 or higher players can help a grieving 
	widow locate her long-lost husband. Xik Minru sounds a little familiar 
	doesn't it? </p>
	<p>Enrico's Betrayal - Level 60 or higher players can help the commander of 
	the Viamontian invasion cover up evidence of his various betrayals.</p>
	<p>Marae Lassel Kill Tasks - Level 20-80 players can obtain kill tasks 
	involving the Viamontian invasion of Marae Lassel</p>
	<p>Well that just about covers everything. But of course there are many more 
	quests and surprises in store for you in this event! We'll be talking about 
	the October Event in the near future.</p>
	<p>See you in Dereth!<br>
