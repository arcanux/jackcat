	<p>
    Ardry crouched in the cover of a stand of trees, watching the distant light 
	of an abandoned campfire burn down to cinders. He'd been waiting since 
	sundown for the ostensible occupant of this camp, a scholar from Zaikhal 
	named Meshenq, to make an appearance. He knew that Meshenq was here to 
	investigate reports of Tanada assassins appearing in the southern land 
	bridge area, and so it would have been natural to expect the scholar to be 
	gone for hours at a time. Even so, the guttering campfire made Ardry 
	suspicious. His years of exploring the wild lands of Dereth had helped him 
	develop an unexplainable but undeniably accurate &quot;danger sense&quot;. He was 
	beginning to come to the conclusion that Meshenq's absence from this camp 
	was not explained by the scholar's zeal for exploration.<br>
	<br>
	Muttering a prayer to distant Isparian gods, Ardry drew his sword and 
	stepped cautiously out of cover. There was no answering activity from the 
	camp or from the woods surrounding the camp. Somewhat reassured, Ardry 
	slowly approached the tent, eyes and ears alert for any sign of danger.<br>
	<br>
	Meshenq had set up his camp on a patch of sandy white ground in the middle 
	of a light forest. As Ardry approached, the light of the moon illuminated 
	some footprints in the sand, heading west from the camp. Ardry's worst 
	suspicions were confirmed when he came closer. Dark, dried blood was mixed 
	in with the footprints. The earth was disturbed and kicked up all around the 
	campfire, showing signs of combat or at least a struggle. Finally, as Ardry 
	examined the area nearer the tent, he found a large, black stain where a 
	great deal of blood had been spilled on the ground, hours before.<br>
	<br>
	With still no enemy presence found in the area, Ardry sheathed his sword, 
	gathered a few more sticks and logs, and sat down by the fire. He carefully 
	built the fire back up from its guttering embers while he considered the 
	evidence he'd found and tried to decide his next course of action.<br>
	<br>
	It was certainly possible that the great gout of blood had sprung from the 
	body of one of Meshenq's foes, and not from the scholar's own body. However, 
	when Ben Ten had asked Ardry to come out here and meet with Meshenq to 
	coordinate their efforts, she had spoken of the scholar as &quot;well-read&quot; on 
	the subjects of wilderness survival and personal defense, but not possessed 
	of much practical experience. Ardry snorted at the idea of someone being 
	well-read on wilderness survival and combat. Meshenq was no warrior. He 
	might know how to identify a hundred different healing herbs and he might 
	have seen a diagram of the proper stance for staff-fighting, but if he had 
	encountered the trained killers of the Tanada clan out here, the blood was 
	almost certainly Meshenq's own.<br>
	<br>
	And if Meshenq had truly been slain here and planned to return, he would 
	have gotten back here within the hours that Ardry spent observing an empty 
	camp. Since he had not returned, Ardry reasoned, it was highly likely that 
	he had chosen to lick his wounds in his hometown of Zaikhal or in the much 
	nearer Gharu'n town of Qalaba'r. As he coaxed life back into the fire, Ardry 
	muttered to himself.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Imagine you're a scholar, Ardry. A lifelong ink-sniffing, paper-shuffling 
	academic like Uncle Aliester. What do you do when you go into the mountains 
	on a dangerous, exciting field trip to find those enigmatic Tanada, and end 
	up getting murdered by them?&quot; He snorted as he used a stick to prod a thick 
	log into a better position on the fire, then continued his monologue.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You probably count your trip an 'unqualified success' and sit in a tavern 
	for the next six weeks trying to come up with fancy words to describe how 
	much you learned about the Tanada when they sliced you open from stem to 
	stern with their historically fascinating ancestral blades... You'd probably 
	be very proud of yourself and the sacrifice you made for the sake of 
	knowledge, while field-testing and follow-up of your neat conclusions gets 
	left to some fool who's too used to getting murdered in the name of other 
	people's knowledge...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry snorted, smiling at his own bitterness. He'd never voiced any of these 
	sentiments to his Uncle Aliester, whose own impressive academic credentials 
	on Dereth had been built largely on Ardry's willingness to brave death and 
	dismemberment for the sake of discovery. Such criticisms were likely to go 
	over (or under) his uncle's head, and so he saved his angry tirades for 
	these occasions in the wilds when no one else was around to hear.<br>
	<br>
	After a few minutes, Ardry had built the fire back up to a healthy crackling 
	blaze. He'd be able to see it and find his way back to it from a long 
	distance, even through the trees. That task completed, he turned his back to 
	the fire and stared out into the west, allowing his eyes to grow accustomed 
	to the dark again. As he waited, he spent a few minutes honing the edge of 
	his sword. His previous encounters with the Tanada and their implausibly 
	sharp blades had made him vaguely self-conscious of the condition in which 
	he kept his own weapons. It was almost as if he'd imagined the Tanada 
	examining his weapons after they killed him, and laughing behind their masks 
	in mockery of the foolish Aluvian with the dull, notched blades.<br>
	<br>
	When he was satisfied with his night vision and with the sharpness of his 
	blade, Ardry slipped off into the woods, heading west from the camp. He 
	hadn't gone very far before he caught sight of a familiar reddish glow in 
	the woods ahead. Suspecting he'd found a new Tanada training school, Ardry 
	circled around and approached from the south. As he got closer, however, he 
	caught scent of something that gave him pause. There was a sharp, metallic 
	odor in the wind, a smell that reminded him of some of the reconnaissance 
	missions he'd undertaken years before, when investigating the Virindi and 
	the renegades who had split off from the Virindi...<br>
	<br>
	&quot;This can't be right,&quot; Ardry muttered to himself, as he crouched near the 
	base of a large evergreen just a stone's throw from the swirling portal. 
	&quot;Why would they... I mean, what would they...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	A sudden, terrible thought occurred to him just then, something about the 
	inadvisability of talking out loud to oneself when approaching a hive full 
	of Nanjou Shou-Jen or possibly worse things. He spun around and straightened 
	up on that sudden premonition of danger, and came face to face with one of 
	the masked assassins. This one was not dressed like the other Tanada that 
	Ardry had encountered before. His clothes were a dark, shimmering blue 
	instead of the normal black. Strange scaly textures covered the limbs of the 
	Tanada's outfit...<br>
	<br>
	Before Ardry could act to defend himself, the Tanada jabbed a blade into his 
	stomach. He gasped, suddenly unable to make his limbs move. He tottered on 
	his feet, held up only by the firm hand that held a blade hilt-deep in his 
	guts. His chest convulsed and he coughed up blood right in the assassin's 
	face. The assassin's gaze remained devoid of emotion even as Ardry's blood 
	spattered his mask and eyes. Ardry tried to get some kind of reaction from 
	the Tanada as he smiled and murmured through bloody teeth, &quot;So... sharp...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Without even frowning or narrowing his eyes, the Tanada twisted the blade, 
	and Ardry saw no more before the lurching pull of portalspace took him away 
	and brought him back to his lifestone.</p>

	<p>Adso crested the hill and took a deep breath. The swirling winds at that 
	elevation brought the scent of evergreen forests and crisp mountain air to 
	his nostrils, carrying a hint of winter thaw and spring growth. It was a 
	welcome change from the stench of gore and corruption that clung to his 
	equipment, to his clothing, and to his skin. Down in the plains and canyons, 
	where the wind was less active, he'd been smelling that same stink for 
	almost a full day, since their long run out of the Direlands. Scrubbing with 
	sand and water had removed the worst of the smell, but an unnatural stench 
	remained. He grimaced as the young acolyte Sabithra came up to stand next to 
	him, and subjected him to her own ripe miasma of graveyard odors.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You're not still mad about that rat attack, are you?&quot; Sabithra asked, as 
	they looked out over the Gharu'n town of Qalaba'r. The sun was setting to 
	their left and it cast the picturesque town in a dramatic golden light. <br>
	<br>
	Adso paused for a moment, and tried to imagine himself speaking with the 
	same cool detachment as their Master. &quot;Suffice it to say that, until further 
	notice, you won't be left alone any more. And once we get back to Master's 
	compound, you'll be restricted from these long rangings.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra protested. &quot;Master's instructions were to thoroughly scout the 
	graveyard, Elder Brother, and that's what I tried to do.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;We could have scouted it thoroughly after I got back. Without you getting 
	in over your head fighting those things. Without you abandoning our camp to 
	those disgusting rats. They chewed up my extra boots and fouled my rations, 
	damn it.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I didn't think the rats would roam that far. And when I left camp it was 
	still daylight, I thought it would be safe to go for a short while...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Perhaps if you'd spent any time at all observing their movements before 
	abandoning your watch to gallivant through that graveyard yourself, you 
	might have been able to anticipate the danger from the roving pack of giant, 
	diseased rats.&quot; His voice rose in anger.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;How many times must I apologize for that? I truly am sorry, Elder Brother.&quot; 
	Adso glanced at her, examining her with keen eyes, honed by Master's 
	training. She was not yet disciplined enough to conceal her smirk or hide 
	the amusement in her tone.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's not about being sorry, Acolyte. It's about your brothers, sisters, and 
	Master himself not being able to trust you to keep a simple watch.&quot; Adso's 
	tone dripped with contempt, particularly as he called her &quot;Acolyte&quot; instead 
	of referring to her by her name.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;There were strange things going on in that graveyard. I wanted to 
	investigate what those undead were up to, and I thought that things would be 
	over before you got back from your own scouting trip. I displayed 
	initiative, Elder Brother! Like Master always encourages you to do!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Master encourages me to take initiative because I've proven myself to him. 
	It's a privilege you must earn, Acolyte. For now it's apparent to me that 
	you have not yet earned that trust. And Master will trust me enough to 
	believe me when I tell him that you're not ready to go on a solo ranging.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra frowned, started to retort, thought better of it, and very 
	obviously bit back whatever she was about to say. She continued to seethe, 
	however. Adso caught note of her expression. &quot;Feel fortunate that I didn't 
	kill you there and send you back to the lifestone directly to answer 
	Master's questions,&quot; he said. &quot;Or leave you to the rats and the undead.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra bowed, finally seeming to accept his rebuke. They stood watching 
	Qalaba'r for a few more minutes. Finally, Adso started down the slope 
	towards the town.<br>
	<br>
	As she walked two paces behind him, Sabithra piped up again. &quot;It was a 
	fascinating place though, wasn't it? It's not on any of those maps you 
	drew...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded stiffly. &quot;It wasn't there before. I've covered every inch of the 
	Direlands, by myself or with Master. I remember scouting that location less 
	than a year ago. I swear that there was no evidence of this graveyard then. 
	It's almost as if some force dragged it out of the ground...&quot; He paused, 
	then shook his head. &quot;You'll get used to it, Acolyte. This island holds more 
	secrets than you can imagine. Enough secrets to drive you mad.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;How old was that graveyard?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ancient. Older than almost anything else I've come across. Master will 
	certainly want a detailed report when we get back.&quot; He paused. &quot;You fought 
	well there, Sabithra. And courageously. I must give you that.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra smiled at that, immeasurably cheered by Elder Brother's unexpected 
	praise and his use of her name.<br>
	<br>
	As they came upon the outskirts of Qalaba'r, Sabithra spotted a group of 
	desert rabbits in a clump of underbrush by the road. Thinking that some 
	rabbit stew would make a tasty meal for tonight's camp, she whipped a pair 
	of throwing knives into the bushes. Two simultaneous squeaks sounded out as 
	the knives found their marks, and the remaining rabbits scattered, fleeing 
	deeper into the forest.<br>
	<br>
	Adso sighed. &quot;Was that truly necessary? Again you strike without 
	permission.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra grinned mischievously. &quot;I thought I'd make some fine rabbit 
	slippers to compensate you for the damage the rats did to your boots, Elder 
	Brother.&quot; She strode quickly towards the bushes and knelt, reaching in to 
	part the undergrowth and seek out the rabbits she'd killed.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh! They're just babies!&quot; Her disappointment was evident in her tone. She 
	leaned further into the bushes. &quot;What's this then? There's another...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso heard a familiar high-pitched snarling noise from the bushes, and the 
	sound made him pale with remembered terror. Even as he reached for his sword 
	and charged forward, Sabithra screamed.</p>

	<b>Changes and Updates</b><br>
	Currently, players are locked out of the Lower Catacomb and the Ley Line 
	Cavern when they have completed the quest. This should be fixed for March<br>
	<br>
	With April 1st falling during the time of the March event, expect some fun 
	and surprises this month<br>
	<br>
	Spring is in the air and the snow has all melted away. <br>
	<br>
	With the return of spring, we are seeing the return of the baby rabbits to 
	landscape. Those little guys always like to get a head start on things. <br>
	<br>
	Asheron has returned home and has once again made his island open to the 
	people of Dereth. Make sure that you stop by and pay him a visit. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Recent Tech Improvments</b><br>
	Normally this point of the LttP would be used for the in concept section. 
	This month we are going to do things a little differently. We are going to 
	take this opportunity to look at some of the newer tech that has been added 
	to the game in the last few months. This does not mean that we do not have 
	many other things still in concept, this is just a little break from the 
	norm to help show off some of the less noticed features that have been added 
	to the game recently.<br>
	<br>
	One of the newer things we have been able to add to the game is the ability 
	for NPC's to be able to check your inventory for specific items. So for 
	example NPC A wants to know if you have collected ten of the special item. 
	You use the NPC and he/she can now determine if you have in fact collected 
	the items in question. This means that in some cases, instead of having to 
	hand in every item, you can now just talk to the NPC and let them check it, 
	which leads to another new tech item... NPC's being able to take a needed 
	item from your inventory.<br>
	<br>
	When an NPC can take an item from your inventory it allows us to be more 
	creative in what a player would need to get in terms of items to complete a 
	quest. This tech also makes it easier on the players. In the past, after 
	collecting an item or items, players would then have to click and drag an 
	item over to the corresponding NPC in order to advance the quest they are 
	on. Often this would cause problems with completing a quest due to any 
	number of issues. With this new tech, this is no longer the case. <br>
	<br>
	In the coming weeks we will be able to discuss some of the newer tech that 
	players may notice in the March update. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the newer things that have made it in to the game 
	the last couple of months. As we continue to expand on what we thought was 
	not possible, new options will open up for the team as to what we can do in 
	the next few months and beyond. <br>
	<br>
	Please remember that along with everything listed here, there are several 
	new quests and exciting things going into the game for the March event.<br>
