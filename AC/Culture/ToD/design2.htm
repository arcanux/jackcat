	<b>New Quest - Tanada Temple of Black Water!</b><br>
	Details from swordsman the player of HG!<br>
	<br>
	Levels: 80+<br>
	Element - fire<br>
	Quest requirements: Need to have completed previous Tanada quests.<br>
	<br>
	To begin go to Wawato and speak to Pau Yajin. He is outside the maskmaker's 
	place to the east of the lifestone. He asks you to go to 24.2S, 57.1E to the 
	Tanada Temple of Blackwater and bring him back the jade medallion of the 
	Master of Depths.<br>
	<br>
	Wo head to the NW now and prepare to assail another Tanada temple.<br>
	<br>
	Tanada Temple of Blackwater - 24.2S, 57. E. <br>
	Now head down the hole in the ground and prepare to assail the temple. Go 
	down a ramp north and then follow it to a maze stretching north and east. Go 
	north, once you hit the wall head west and down a ramp to the north. <br>
	Again there will be a Tanada Black Water Gatekeeper. Kill him and loot his 
	key. Continue east. The door has 9999 resistance so be sure to get key. Next 
	use key on the door and enter the Tanada temple (no level restriction).<br>
	<br>
	Now proceed north and down the ramp into a chamber with 2 guards and an exit 
	north. Kill them then head north and into another chamber with an exit to 
	the NE. Take it. Now you arrive in a room with a few Tanada and 3 rooms on 
	the east wall. Take the hallway at the northern end of the room.<br>
	<br>
	You will arrive in a room with 2 Acolytes of the Depths and a Virindi Consul 
	and an exit north. There will be 2 black obsidian pillars that the consul is 
	in between. Kill them all then head north. You will head down and come out 
	in a room with the Essence of Artifice spewing out from in between 2 
	obsidian pillars. Here is the Master of the Depths. Once you kill him, loot 
	the jade medallion of the depths from him (4 minute re-spawn). Once you all 
	have the medallion, go back to Sawato and to our dear friend. <br>
	<br>
	Our friend tells us that the source of this corruption may be found using the 
	shrine of Black Water back in the temple, and then he sends us to dispense 
	with this corruption. We return once more to 24.2S, 57.1E and this time go 
	up into the building and use the shrine in the center of the room. To begin, 
	go to the east and ignore the side chamber. You will find a chamber with a 
	few side rooms to the north and and exit east, go east.<br>
	<br>
	You will enter a room with an exit to the north and some new enemies there 
	called Fist of the Depths. Now in this room you will find 3 Fist of the 
	Depths and our target, the Watcher of the Black Water. Slay them all. After 
	you kill them, loot the Mask of the Black Water Watcher and his obsidian 
	shard. take the shard to Zaikhal for translation.<br>
	<br>
	The Fists of the Depth do hollow damage like general Kain Kivix, so be 
	careful. The Watcher is on a five minute timer and the shard is on no timer. 
	The mask, however, I could not pick up another of because it said I had 
	solved the quest too many times.</font></span></p><font face="arial" size="2">

	Laboratory!</b><br>
	Kalazar of SC reports: &quot;I got a gem from the new corporal near Jarvis in 
	Cragstone (25.6N, 49.4E), then ran to 9.8S, 81.0W. Inside I found a bell, and gave it the 
	attunement gem. I then used the bell. It summoned the Laboratory portal, 
	levels 120+. Inside I ran through making sure to keep going down. Inside was 
	a few mosswarts and drudges. Mainly it was shadows and virindi. At the 
	bottom I found a olthoi experiment log and an Imprisoned Monouga. Then back 
	to Crag -- I gave him the log and got 97 mil. :)&quot;</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
	Corporal Liao Chen tells you, &quot;Greetings, adventurer. I greet you in the 
	name of Queen Elysa, whose command brings me here today.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Corporal Liao Chen gives you Monouga Laboratory Portal 
	Attunement Gem.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Corporal Liao Chen tells, you &quot;We seek an intrepid 
	adventurers like yourself, who might be willing to help us investigate a 
	concerning development. It seems that some travelers have discovered a 
	cavern in which drudges have been keeping monouga captive. What is unusual 
	is that the drudges have very sophisticated portal sending enchantments 
	which would seem to be beyond their means. We suspect Virindi involvement of 
	some sort.&quot;<br>
	Corporal Liao Chen tells you, &quot;Therefore, Prince Borelean led an expedition 
	to investigate this drudge cavern. When he was finished, he had determined a 
	way to reverse the portal sending - to open a portal from that location to 
	the source of the monougas. These portal gems are the result of that 
	determination.&quot;<br>
	Corporal Liao Chen tells you, &quot;The Queen has commanded that whatever lay on 
	the other side of that portal transit should be explored carefully, with the 
	assumption that whatever is there is hostile. To do so, take the gem I have 
	given you and charge ti against the feeding bell. It will reverse the 
	working of the bell's portal sending magic, and, instead of summoning a 
	drudge and a monouga, will open portals the source of these monsters.&quot;<br>
	Corporal Liao Chen tells you, &quot;You are welcome to explore the drudge cave, 
	although many have explored it before now. The Queen seeks adventurers to 
	enter the portal from which the monougas come, and hopefully more fully 
	identify exactly what all of this humanoid activity means to the Isparian 
	inhabitants of Dereth.&quot;</font></font></span></p><font face="arial" size="2">
