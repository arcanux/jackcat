	I am sorry that there was a problem tonight. It appears that, in particular 
	one branch of The Colosseum has been causing some headaches. We are in the 
	process of closing this branch down. Once all of these branches are closed 
	down, we are hopeful that we will see a dramatic reduction of the problems 
	we have seen reports of. <br>
	<br>
	If, after we do get all of these troublesome branches shut down you find 
	there is still a problem in The Colosseum, please use Urgent Assistance. Our 
	Envoy's will do everything they can to try and resolve the issue for you.
	<br>
	<br>
	Again we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you or your 
	fellows, as this was not our intention.<br>

	</b>Here's the issue with the bell vanishing.<br>
	<br>
	The 5th arena branch does not portal players out when their hour is up like 
	the other arenas do. So, when your time runs out your bells simply vanish 
	and it seems that it has broken. However it's that the time for the event 
	ran out. However, it seems, due to this the event got out of wack and was 
	starting to end before it should have. I went thround every sever and placed 
	this event in a state that should not allow arena branch 5 to be entered.
	<br>
	<br>
	You will still have access to arenas 1-4 and should not have issues with 
	disapearing bells again. If you do please let us know.<br>
	<br>
	The issue that Kid ran into is a different issue and is easy for an envoy to 
	fix, the disapearing bell issue on the other hand can not be fixed by 
	envoys.</p>

	<p>A little bit of both actually.<br>
	<br>
	The Pxp base for the Colosseum is a little over your level. So you'd make a 
	bit less xp than they would.<br>
	<br>
	Also, the doors stamp you as you use them and overwrite other stamps of the 
	same type.<br>
	<br>
	So, seeing you were running back through and you hit door 11 when you 
	finished you had the stamp for door 11.<br>
	<br>
	You should have a title, but this title should be different than the rest of 
	your fellowship.<br>
	<br>
	If you do not have a title after checking through again let me know and I'll

	</blockquote>
	<p>Yes, the title is pit fighter.<br>
	<br>
	We could make it so that they would not overwite, however, it would make the 
	colosseum have around 5x as many items as it does now. Right now the doors 
	use &quot;relative portal tech&quot; this allows us to portal you a certian distance 
	from where you are. The doors are all placed in the same location and all 
	the arenas are in the same relative location to eachother. So when you hit 
	one it portals you the distance needed ot enter the next arena. <br>
	<br>
	To have it not overwite the flags the doors would need to act like NPCs 
	instead of like portals. So now all the Doors become NPCs that have to check 
	your quest flags before portaling you, but that's the minor part. NPCs can't 
	use relative portal tech at this time, so they would each need to portal 
	have a portal sending spell made for them. This would be 18*5 seperate 
	spells, so 90 new spells adn 90 new doors that all need to be created and 
	tested instead of 1 spell and 18 doors.<br>
	<br>
	Seeing how this turns out we may look into a way to make the flags not 
	overwrite.</p>

	As of right now there is no way for an Envoy to tell if you actually had a

	<br>

	impatient. All we ask is that you use some extra caution when pulling from 
	this particular chest. <br>
	<br>
	1. Make sure nobody else had pulled from the chest for at least 5 minutes.<br>
	2. Try to make sure nobody else tries to use the chest while you are using 
	your key. <br>
	3. Make sure not to click the chest too many times, causing it to close as 
	soon as you have opened it. <br>
	<br>
	As soon as we have any more information on this, we will be sure to post it. 
	We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.<br>

	<br>
	</b>Thanks for the feedback, I've seen a fairly well defined split of people

	<br>
	We took PvP into account when making these rings and came to the conclusion 
	that, as has been stated here, most serious PvP players already have all 
	their major wards, getting this ring simply gives them an opertunity to 
	diversify slightly. <br>
	<br>
	As a fairly standard player on a &quot;carebear&quot; world I have all my wards on my 
	set, including imbued rings, and I also manage to have all the other majors 
	I find useful as a mage who does not use heavy melee defense.<br>
	<br>
	I'm looking forward to see how many of these rings get into the hands of 
	players.<br>
	<br>
	I'm quite impressed at what I've seen of the Colosseum on DT. Players 
	fighting over control of the entrance and, from what I've heard, the most 
	accomplished Colosseum run out of any server.</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Or players who have finished the Colosseum can work

	<br>
	However, there may be the ability to make it so that the rings in the chest 
	are not active yet, the players may have to get an item to craft it with. 
	When they craft it it gives it the spells, makes it neither attuned nor 
	bonded, and makes it wieldable only by the crafter. I'm not 100% that this 
	will work correctly, but I'll bring it up. <br>
	<br>
	This way you could strip someone's ring but you would not be able to use it

	<p>Hi there and welcome to the February 26th edition of the weekly update. 
	We hope every one had a great weekend. So let’s get into what is going in 
	the week in the world of Asheron’s Call!<br>
	<br>
	It appears that everyone has been enjoying our new little Colosseum and the 
	February event in general. It has been an interesting week of people 
	planning out different strategies, getting groups together and overall 
	having fun. We love to see people just having fun, enjoying the content that 
	everyone on the team works so hard to get out. While some folks have made it 
	very close, as far as we know, nobody has been able to complete the 
	Colosseum. Only time will tell if any group will be able to complete this 
	new challenge. <br>
	<br>
	We will be making some tweaks, changes and improvements to the Colosseum in 
	the coming months to not only improve things as a whole, but to also add 
	more things for players to do. In order to consolidate things a little 
	please feel free to use this thread to give us feedback on what you think 
	could use some improvement in the Colosseum. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on getting things together for the March 
	event. The quest designs have been written and the team is now focusing on 
	getting the new content implemented internally for the beginnings of 
	testing. Some of the ideas that are going in for March look really exciting 
	and we will have more information on those things as we get closer to the 
	March event. <br>
	<br>
	There were some billing issues over the weekend which caused some people to 
	have some issues or delays accessing the billing pages. These issues should 
	now be resolved and everyone should be able to access our billing site 
	without issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused 
	people. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this one. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are looking at a few balance tweaks. A few

	non-melee characters can solo/small group the Colosseum, 2. Olthoi Demons 
	have A LOT of armor. 3. One of the creatures has a regen rate that's really 
	high that wasn't intended. Feel free to give any feedback.<br>
	<br>
	None of these things should make the Colosseum a lot less difficult, but 
	should bring it a little closer to the difficulty we're aiming for.<br>
	<br>
	Also, there are boss fights up and coming and other tweaks/additions to the 
	dynamics around the colosseum and not just the balance.</p>

	<p>The idea is, if you want to do the Colosseum in a small group and gather 
	the lower titles or because you're lower levels you should not be blocked 
	because a monster is only killable by one class that you may not have with 
	you.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Lowering the AL on the Swarm Demons and reducing the regeneration of the 
	certain unnamed monster will help melees/archers as much or more than mages. 
	The only mage assisting tweak we're looking into is making the Crystal Lord 
	killable so those who decide to solo the Coloseum to see how far they can 
	get, or work at it in a small group, or maybe can't recruit a melee are able 
	to advance in the Colosseum. We'll keep the Crystal Lord so that mages do 
	low damage to him, but they and archer will be able to at least land

	<p>Crystal Golem is a seperate creature from the Crystal Lord, the Crystal 
	Golem is a melee killable creature from well back in the day, I made a sword 
	character just to fight them because they dropped the most majors. Mages 
	only hit Crystal Golems for around 10 or so per war magic spell. In the case 
	of the Crystal Lord Archers and Mages can't even land attacks it. I was 
	using that as a reference point to how hard the Crystal Lord should be for 
	the mages once they are allowed to be able to hit it with spells. They'll 
	land attacks on it but they'll do very little damage instead of just not 
	being allowed to land attacks. This will not effect how hard melee/missile 
	characters can hit the Crystal Lords for, they'll be top dog on this no 
	matter what.<br>
	<br>
	Also, you asked about fighting a room of VoD Virindi without magic. In our 
	in house play throughs of the Colosseum I played an Archer so I've faught 
	them without magic, I did fairly decent damage (was using the new Composite 
	Bow), not the best damage of anyone in the group, but with Imperils/Vulns (I 
	used a runed bow to land Imperils when I needed them myself) and a full 
	group you should be able to clear that room without needing a War Mage. The 
	main point is to not need a specific class at all (no creature is 100% 
	invulnerable to a certain attack type though some are good for melee and 
	some are good for mage), but to have it set up so that a good mix of 
	templates and attack types will make the Colosseum run more 
	efficient/quicker.</p>

	<p>silvurhawke, I can understand your concern but we're working with you, 
	not against you. We're making one minor change that will make the Crystal 
	Lord hittable by Mages/Archers. However, a mage will be able to kill a 
	Crystal Lord about as well as a melee could kill a hand full of VoD Virinidi 
	without Imping/Vulning them, a mage would still definately do better with 
	their racial weapon if they have one. The point isn't to make mages the best 
	against them, it's to make it so it's not an artificial block (artificial 
	block meaning that it blocks players from continuing by a means other than 
	difficulty, in this case is impossible to hit).<br>
	<br>
	We're also looking at lowering the armor level on Swarm Demons and another 
	couple creatures. This is definately melee/archer love and should make them 
	more useful.<br>
	<br>
	Most of the tweaks we're looking at for the Colosseum will be making 
	melees/archers better than they are now.<br>
	<br>
	I think the leading concern is that the Colosseum may become too easy, we're 
	going to be very cautious about this and try to change the actual balance as 
	little as possible.</p>

	need to keep in touch with how the players are receiving things and what

	<br>
	About vitae, we don't have any plans with vitae and the Colosseum at this

	Hi there and welcome to the first March edition of the weekly update. Let’s 
	get right in to what is going on this week in the world of Asheron’s Call.
	<br>
	<br>
	First, we would like to offer our congratulations to all of those people who 
	have made it through the Colosseum. Those brave adventurers made it further 
	than anyone else, and should be very proud of themselves and their friends. 
	Nice work everyone!<br>
	<br>
	We know that there have been some problems with the reward chest and the 
	team has been trying to find a solution to the issue. Until we have found a 
	solution, we ask that if you are looting the chest please make sure and take 
	all of the items out of the chest before closing it. In trying to find a fix 
	for the issues, we have found that this may help with some of the locking 
	issues folks are having. In the meantime we are continuing to investigate 
	the chests and I have asked that all of the people, who have completed the 
	Colosseum but did not get to loot the chest, contact me via PM here on the 
	forums. We are optimistic that a solution to this issue can and will be 
	found.<br>
	<br>
	This week the team is all about implementation of the March event content on 
	our test servers internally. Working out the kinks and balance issues as 
	well as just plain getting things to work the way they want them to. Just 
	looking at everything going in for the month, I would say folks are in for a 
	good time. From the looks of it there appears to be a little something for 
	everyone, as well as a few new surprises which I have been sworn not to tell 
	anyone about.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Wink" alt="" src="rekindling/wink.gif.html" border="0"><br>
	<br>
	Last but not least I want to out a little heads up/advanced warning to all 
	you movie makers out there. At some point this week I will be announcing all 
	of the details to a little Make a Movie contest featuring AC. This is your 
	chance to show off your crazy skills at making an Asheron’s Call movie. For 
	now the only other tidbit I will give out is the theme, The Colosseum. Stay 
	tuned for all the particulars later this week.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" alt="" src="rekindling/smile.gif.html" border="0"><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Well, that’s all for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	</b>Exploding Arrows in my post did not mean AoE, that's an entire other can 
	of worms. As of right now you might notice that all of our AoE spells 
	orriginate from the caster, at this time we don't have a way to make a 
	spell/skill effect originate from a target creature or location.<br>
	<br>
	About exploding arrows in my first post, here's a praticle example. When you 
	hit a creature a particle effect is emitted, one may think that it's the 
	weapon that causes this to happen, however the particle effect of being hit 
	is actually part of the creature that it knows to set off when it's hit. So 
	for a creature to look like it's been hit by an exploding arrow it would 
	need to have a particle effect that it knows to set off only when hit by a 
	certain type of arrow or bow. It's not all that trivial.</p>

	Frelorn</a>)</span><p>Hello there and welcome to the March 12th edition of 
	the Weekly Update! Let’s get right in to what is going on this week. <br>
	<br>
	So I know some of you are concerned over the key/chest issues with the 
	Colosseum, and we have not forgotten about you. At some point in the next 
	week or so, those people who have contacted us about the chest errors they 
	got from using the reward key for completing the Colosseum will be 
	contacted. The good news in all of this is that we are very optimistic that 
	we have found a fix for the issues surrounding the chest, and the fixes 
	needed should go live with the March event. In the meantime, we will 
	continue to ask that if you are using the chest please make sure to use 
	caution and to be courteous make sure you loot everything out of the chest 
	before closing it for the next person to use. <br>
	<br>
	We have made some other changes to the Colosseum. Here is a list of some of 
	those changes that we have made for the March event. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	• Replaced the second Carenzi fight with a Tukora Lugian fight <br>
	<br>
	• The Swarm Demons have had their AL lowered from 2000 to 1200<br>
	<br>
	• Balanced the Golem Crystal Lord so that it can be hit by 
	Melee/Magic/Missile<br>
	<br>
	• Rebalanced Golem Crystal Lord's resistances and AL, it should be less mage 
	friendly<br>
	<br>
	• The Regen rate on the Elite Guardians has been slightly reduced<br>
	<br>
	• The Ninja fight has been increased by 2 Ninjas<br>
	<br>
	• Ninjas now wield a number of elemental tachis instead of just frost<br>
	<br>
	• Wisps no longer drop treasure<br>
	<br>
	• Master Arbitrator returns your ticket if your fellowship already has 
	access to a Colosseum Branch.<br>
	<br>
	• Alarms in the Arenas now countdown in a more useful way. They inform 
	players each minute for the last 5 minutes how much time they have left.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	In recent weeks there have been many inquiries about when Crowley’s 
	Producer’s statement will be released. If all goes well it should be soon. 
	We are in the process of getting all of the final details worked out and 
	making sure that all the t’s are crossed and the i’s are dotted. I want to 
	get it published as bad as you all want to read it, trust me. <br>
	<br>
	As most of you may have heard by now, we will be having a Developer’s chat 
	this week with our friends over at Warcry. It will be on Thursday the 15th 
	at 8pm EDT. You can head over to http://ac.warcry.com/#69404 for all of the 
	details. Please join us if you can. It should be a fun evening. <br>
	<br>
	We have had a small delay in releasing the details of the upcoming make a 
	movie contest I had mentioned last week. Our legal team just wants to go 
	over everything to make sure all of the bases are covered. We should have 
	all the information on the upcoming contest very soon. <br>
	<br>
	Last but not least, we will be paying the maintenance on all housing for the 
	next couple of weeks in order to help out those people who are having issues 
	getting the game to run while using Windows Vista. This is only a temporary 
	thing and is not a substitution for a proper fix for those people having 
	problems. We however do feel that people having problems should not be 
	punished for upgrading their operating systems. We are hopeful we will be 
	able to find a solution in the meantime. We appreciate everyone’s patience 
	while we work though these issues. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Everyone have a great day and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>
