	<p>
    Ardry crouched in the wide stone hallway, trying to ignore the chill in his 
	bones. He’d found this portal, strangely unguarded and unwarded, in the 
	middle of the Singularity Caul after the Council of Sages had asked him to 
	investigate rumors of Elemental activity in the area.<br>
	<br>
	So far, all he’d seen in this complex had been Virindi and their Hollow 
	Minion servants. Hollow Minions were no trouble for him to avoid – their 
	clanking limbs made them easy to detect down these long, barren corridors. 
	The cloaked, floating Virindi were tougher to detect, but Ardry had spent 
	enough time intruding their lairs that he’d managed to develop a legitimate 
	“Virindi sense”. He always felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle up 
	if one of the sickle-wielding creatures was near.<br>
	<br>
	That’s why it was such a surprise to him when, without any warning from his 
	Virindi sense, he felt the cold touch of a blade against the back of his 
	neck. He froze for one second as he realized what kind of a position he was 
	in, then tensed to act. He knew he’d have to roll low to escape the 
	Virindi’s weapon swing, and come up ready to dodge a War spell or two…<br>
	<br>
	“Don’t move,” a voice whispered from behind him. “Otherwise, I’ll be forced 
	to cut you with this blade, and you won’t enjoy full-body paralysis. People 
	tend to soil their breeches.” It was a familiar voice, certainly not the 
	disembodied inner-ear echo that he was used to hearing when a Virindi felt 
	compelled to try and communicate with him. The dry humor behind the threat 
	was also familiar.<br>
	<br>
	“Adso?” he whispered.<br>
	<br>
	The blade retreated and he heard a familiar snort of amusement.<br>
	<br>
	“Ardy. I should have known it was you from the nervous shuffling steps near 
	the portal outside. I could even hear you muttering ‘Oh Pwyll, not again,’ 
	from a hundred yards behind.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry smiled wryly into the darkness, trying not to let his amusement show 
	to the ineffable and terrifyingly competent assassin behind him. “You got 
	me, oh silent one. I recognized you by the obsession with my soiled 
	breeches.”<br>
	<br>
	A strong hand grasped him and pulled him into the nearest room, which 
	contained the as-yet-undiscovered corpse of the last Hollow Minion that 
	Ardry had dispatched. He finally turned around to confront the young 
	assassin and grinned, trying to seem more confident than he felt. Adso 
	grinned back and gave him a friendly clap on the shoulder, but noticeably 
	did not sheathe the poisoned dagger he’d been holding at Ardry’s neck just a 
	moment earlier.<br>
	<br>
	“What are you doing here?” Adso demanded, and just like that his demeanor 
	was back to pure business.<br>
	<br>
	“I might ask the same of you.” Ardry crossed his arms truculently, but he 
	knew he wasn’t going to push this defiance much farther, not with horde of 
	Virindi and Hollow Minions nearby.<br>
	<br>
	Adso matched his bluff. “You tell me what you’re doing here first. It’s the 
	polite thing to do, after I spared you the paralysis and the laundering 
	expense. I must imagine that the washerwoman at the Smoking Axe is tired of 
	your business. I may even decide I want to cooperate with you.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded. “I was sent here by the Council of Sages to investigate 
	Elemental activity.” He was careful to avoid mentioning the rumor of a 
	Harbinger’s presence…<br>
	<br>
	Adso regarded him warily. “Strangely enough, I was sent here to investigate 
	Shadow activity.” The two of them stared into each other’s eyes, each 
	confused by the other’s news.<br>
	<br>
	“Then why…” Ardry began.<br>
	<br>
	“Are we fighting Virindi?” Adso finished. He nodded to Ardry, as if some 
	decision had been made. “Let’s find out together.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry blinked, unsure of how to proceed. He felt a certain kinship and 
	respect for Adso, but he knew Adso served an amoral Master whose final 
	loyalty was only to his own interests, who regarded the deaths of innocents 
	as an unfortunate but perfectly acceptable expedient. Still, he could not 
	deny how useful their assistance, freely offered, had been in the days when 
	the realm had been threatened by the Shadow-mantled demon Grael. Adso’s 
	master had forced a truce between two warring sects of assassins and helped 
	bring the realms that they served into a common cause to stop the demon…<br>
	<br>
	“Ardry, you’re dithering like you have a choice here. I’m making this offer 
	because it would inconvenience me to kill you and hide your corpse from the 
	Virindi. It would slow down my investigation. My way or the lifestone, 
	friend.” <br>
	<br>
	There was not a hint of cockiness in Adso’s voice, but a sure and certain 
	promise. Ardry knew the truth of his claim well enough. The best he could 
	hope for, if he resisted, would be to cause enough commotion to draw the 
	Virindi and their Hollow Minions, spoiling Adso’s own investigation. He 
	would almost certainly make an eternal enemy of this deadly man, who could 
	switch from humor and jokes to cold-blooded murder without warning.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, Ardry nodded. “All right. Let’s go.”<br>
	<br>
	Adso grinned, sincere delight evident in his expression. “Wonderful. I would 
	have regretted killing you. Allow me to take the point, friend.”<br>
	<br>
	With that, he winked stalked forward, leading the way into the long dark 
	corridor, poisoned dagger out in front of him. Ardry shook his head and 
	followed.<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">
	<p>In a mist-shrouded valley between the Obsidian Plains and the Inner Sea 
	of Dereth sat the ruins of an ancient graveyard. Shambling undead and 
	corruption-tainted rats lurked in the cold recesses of the crypts. Wisps and 
	ghosts glowing with malevolent energy hovered in the open spaces between 
	gravestones. Into this nightmarish patch of land came an even stranger 
	creature, scurrying nervously between hiding places to mask its presence 
	from the roving groups of undead.<br>
	<br>
	The figure dashed from one shadowed recess to another, seeking refuge behind 
	the walled crypt of a long-dead (or long-undead) Dericostian nobleman. As 
	the figure closed on its new hiding place, it tripped over an unseen rock 
	and stumbled the last few strides to safety. Reeling and off-balance, it 
	collided face-first with the back wall of the crypt and rebounded, falling 
	gracelessly and landing on a patch of rocky dirt.<br>
	<br>
	“Ouch!” cried Aliester the Loquacious as he hit the cold ground. A jagged 
	chunk of marble was digging into his back, just above his kidney. His 
	shoulder had landed on a broad and uneven slab of rock. His forehead was 
	scratched and bleeding from his face-first meeting with the stone wall. He 
	could feel his toe throbbing where he had stubbed it. All in all, it was the 
	most seriously he’d been injured in the last five years, since his nephew 
	Ardry had taken over all the field work.<br>
	<br>
	Drawing a deep breath to steady himself, the aged scholar scrambled to get 
	fully under the cover of the moldering wall. He rubbed a hand against his 
	forehead and winced at the sight of his own blood. Suddenly he remembered 
	his nephew’s advice to him before he’d undertaken this expedition…<br>
	<br>
	“Uncle, if you really are so impatient that you must explore the graveyard 
	before I’ve returned from the Singularity Caul, be careful to avoid the 
	patrols, and above all make no noise.”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester grimaced. He’d certainly made noise. Ardry had warned him about how 
	suddenly one could be swarmed over in this area. In the cold night air, 
	sweat began to bead on his brow. What had seemed like an irresistible bit of 
	adventure was starting to turn into a nightmarish reality. He could already 
	see the patrols moving past the hiding places he’d used to get to this spot, 
	well within the boundaries of the graveyard… He’d already realized that 
	getting out would likely involve the hurried use of a portal gem or a 
	painful trip to the lifestone that he’d visited just before coming here. He 
	could accept that, and he had the recall scroll to facilitate a quick 
	return…<br>
	<br>
	But now, if his clumsiness had alerted creatures to his presence, he might 
	not even be able to accomplish what he’d hoped before being forced to 
	retreat. If I achieve nothing else here, at least I got to talk to that 
	delightful merchant, Aliester thought to himself. Maybe I should have gone 
	to find that rat-catcher the scouts told me about first…<br>
	<br>
	Hoping that he had remained unheard, he crouched against the crypt wall and 
	peaked over the edge of the stone barrier. The first thing he saw was a 
	glowing humanoid outline, moving swiftly in his direction. As the spirit 
	drew closer, Aliester began to make out features: a vaguely female 
	silhouette, wrapped in rotting Dericostian finery, and a face like a skull 
	with glowing pale eyes… He beamed in recognition. <br>
	<br>
	“Lady Tairla!” he called out to the advancing specter. With his objective in 
	sight, he forgot all of Ardry’s warnings. He stood up to his full height and 
	waved to the ancient Lady of House Mhoire and attempted to engage her in 
	conversation. “You will not recognize me, but my nephew, Ardry, has paid 
	numerous fruitless visits to this graveyard to seek you out for parlay! You 
	have proven quite elusive for a noblewoman, my lady!” He laughed nervously 
	as he noticed that Lady Tairla seemed not to acknowledge his attempts to 
	speak with her. In fact, he could now sense the magical energy accumulating 
	in her glowing hands…<br>
	<br>
	“My lady!” he cried out, as a chilling blast of energy washed over him. He’d 
	just been rendered more vulnerable to frost magic, Lady Tairla’s weapon of 
	choice… He waved his hands in the air, desperately trying to signal his 
	peaceful intent.<br>
	<br>
	“My lady, I come in peace, to speak with you! I would ask you questions 
	about the fall of your House at the hands of the tyrant Geraine!”<br>
	<br>
	The advancing shade seemed to hiss in rage at the mention of Geraine’s name, 
	and a frost-bolt of terrible power slammed into him, knocking him to the 
	ground. Shuddering and shaking off ice crystals as he stood up, Aliester 
	gritted his teeth. “Well,” he muttered to himself, reaching for a 
	newly-purchased crystal in his belt pouch, “If a humble interlocutor seeking 
	your vast wisdom must first duel you into submission, my lady, so be it! 
	Mortal though I may be, I am not unschooled in the arcane arts!”<br>
	<br>
	He shook back the sleeves of his robes and raised his hands to the sky. In 
	his right hand he held his trusty wand. In his left, he crushed the crystal 
	he’d withdrawn from the belt pouch. Immediately he felt his body flood with 
	magical power. He felt giddy and aggressive as the mana within him seemed to 
	boil, almost begging for release as a barrage of war magic. Unable to 
	contain himself, Aliester grinned savagely and conjured a fireball more 
	powerful than he had ever been able to conjure before. He cackled with 
	unfamiliar glee as the fireball engulfed the lady’s shade and stopped her in 
	her tracks.<br>
	<br>
	The ghostly noblewoman’s light seemed to flicker momentarily, and she lifted 
	her hands into the air. In the back of his mind, Aliester was aware that she 
	was using some form of summoning magic, but he was too overwhelmed with the 
	joy of his war magic mastery to pay much heed.<br>
	<br>
	“I do not wish to harm you further, my lady, but I shall have no choice but 
	to blast you again with my newly mickle powers, should you persist in this 
	hostility! Can we not speak civilly, as fellow foes of the dread monarch 
	Geraine?”<br>
	<br>
	Lady Tairla hissed again and unleashed another frost bolt. To his own 
	surprise, Aliester managed to dodge out of the way of that blast. Sighing 
	regretfully, he began to channel his mana to power another fireball.<br>
	<br>
	Abruptly, he felt a brutal impact in the small of his back, and his entire 
	midsection went numb. He looked down and saw a ghostly fist protruding from 
	his midsection. Turning his head, he found himself looking into the 
	translucent, skull-like face of a hooded specter. One of Tairla’s 
	handmaidens, he thought to himself. The reports did say she had servants…<br>
	<br>
	The power he’d been marshalling for the fireball dissipated as he began to 
	shiver uncontrollably. He looked down again, feeling more and more distant 
	from himself, and saw the handmaiden’s glowing fist retract. A moment later 
	he felt another numbing shock go through him as the handmaiden struck him 
	with its other hand.<br>
	<br>
	The world started to go dark, and Aliester was only dimly aware of the third 
	of Lady Tairla’s ice bolts hitting him and knocking him off his feet. He was 
	on his back, looking up into the empty eye sockets of the handmaiden as it 
	raised its glowing fist to finish him off.<br>
	<br>
	“But I never even got to see the rat-catcher…” he murmured to the 
	handmaiden. There was not a hint of understanding in its face as its fist 
	came crashing down.</p>

	<font size="2" face="arial"><b>In Concept/Game Discussion</b><br>
	In months past we have has used this section to discuss things that are 
	either slated to go into the game, or things that we are thinking of putting 
	in the game. This time we are going to use it to solicit a little feedback 
	from you, the players.<br>
	<br>
	I know this has been asked before, but we are going to ask again. What 
	quests are on your top 10 list for the rewards needing an XP increase? In 
	this particular case we are looking for older quests, perhaps the ones that 
	have not seen some love in a long time. Remember all those quests you went 
	through as a new player, which may have not seen any attention for a long 
	time now? A member on the team has agreed to the task of upping some rewards 
	in some of the older content. Just so we are clear, the intent of this 
	project is not to redo any of the dungeons/quests themselves, but to just 
	increase the rewards associated with those quests.

	Click here to make your suggestions</a>.<br>
	<br>
	We would love to do a total revamp of a lot of those older quests, but we 
	have to manage our time very carefully. Changing the rewards is a much 
	easier, less time consuming task that will allow us to get more traffic into 
	some of those older, less frequently used areas. If you are interested in 
	helping the team determine what quests need some reward love, please feel 
	free to post

	your suggestions here</a>. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	September and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed 
	here, there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game 
	for the September event.<br>
