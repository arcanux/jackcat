	Warriors of Dereth, long have you had your way with the defenseless cows of

	for your demented amusement, and still they maintain peace.<br>
	But the cows have suffered long enough. There is one who has risen, one who

	And she stalks the hills east of Ayan Baqur.</font><p align="left">
	<font size="2">Marki Bardo of MT reports: &quot;On Morningthaw today at about 
	7:30pm EST we were attacked by a Very Mad Cow and his evil minions. It 
	resembled normal cows in that it carried parts of Dereth on it's sides but 
	sported a very nasty blood dripping mouth, red color (Probably the red bull 
	of Viamont), and a level of 1034. It was almost always a 1 hit kill for 
	anybody without a shield and had it's magic defense was almost impossible to 
	get past. Few spells were landed on the cow and that only because of the 
	sheer volume of spells cast. Eventually the cow was brought down with the 
	kill going to Darwich. It seems that this was only the beginning, we are 
	only safe 'For now.'&quot;<b> <br>

        Within 1 minute of engaging, Chiun Too was killed by 2 fast hits from 
        the cow. The first was for 214 pts of damage (a crit, got hit through 
        the doppleganger shield for huge amounts), and the second hit put Chiun 
        Too at the LS. There were two seconds between hits that put Too at the 
        LS.<br>
        <br>
        If the cow had her head towards me, I pretty much never connected. From 
        the side/rear, hit reliably for 2 pts at max speed...this with a 30 - 50

		were dead too, and a few more small golems appeared, followed by a Coral 
		Golem Viceroy immediately afterwards. It cooled down for a little and 
		people thought it was done, until what seemed like HUNDREDS of sapphire 
		golems appeared and started attacking anything and everything that 
		moved! There were people dying left and right, and maybe even forwards,

	</span>Hey Maggie, great site, I use it all the time. Anyway, there was a 
	live event on FF today (the 9th). Thought I'd tell you what iIknow. Well 
	first of all my name is &quot;The Returning Soul&quot;. So my patron Reilyn was 
	hanging in our hometown of FF and according to him he saw a dev run into the 
	meeting hall so he followed. Unfortunately for him, the devs spawned a live 
	event on him of about 50 level 135 rats with 6000 health. Naturally he died, 
	but shortly after there was a world wide message like there are rats in the 
	sewers under the Rithwic meeting hall who will save us.<br>
	<br>
	So the whole server rushed over. By the time I buffed up all but three rats 
	were dead inside. So I was talking to a lower level clan mate on the outside 
	of the hall and he got killed by the rats. SO I alerted everyone and we all 
	ran outside.<br>
	<br>
	There was a level 4 Viamontian in a guards robe with a crossbow. He was a 
	dev named like turbine Sypho or something like that. He kept spawning these 
	level 135 rats and then a few 115 rats, and finally about 15 Moarsmen. So 
	there were alot of spawns I didn't count.<br>
	<br>
	Most of critters dropped pretty fast so it wasn't that tough of a battle. My 
	personal contribution was I killed the brown cow in Dereth which made the 
	dev a little mad.<br>
	<br>
	Anyway after it was all over a few black marrow keys spawned and people 
	looted. The level 135 rats dropped 6 tier loot. Lots of high work stuff. 
	Then he chose three people from the crowd and offered them the title of 
	Sanitation engineer.<br>
	<br>
	Then a few other devs showed up and we chatted for a bit, and it was all 
	over. I have a few pics:<br>

    <p align="left"><b><a name="6"></a>Elemental Surge &amp; Galvanic Armor!<br>
    </b>Mustafah Ibn-Jubair of FF reports: &quot;There was a Live Event on Frostfell 
    that started near the Essence of Artifice. A global message came up talking 
    about an &quot;Elemental surge near the Essence of Artifice.&quot; When I got out 
    there, I found a monster called Crystallized Galvanic Mana which was 
    surrounded by lightning/frost elementals and golems ranging from Diamond 
    Golems to Diamond Golem Suzerains. There was also what seemed to be an Envoy 
    controlled Galvanic Knight trying to fend off us Isparians. Upon battling 
    these foes for some time we took the Crystallized Galvanic Mana down to 0 HP 
    where it then restored to full HP. We then turned on the Galvanic Knight and 
    by the time we took him to 0 HP twice he finally died for good. I managed to 
    receive looting rights and found a suit of armor to my surprise. <br>
    <br>
    The death of the Crystallized Galvanic Mana quickly followed.&quot;<br>

	about 8:30 or 9 central, we got a message saying there would be a live event 
	at AB in 10 minutes. They let us pick the monsters we wanted and spawned 
	them for us. There were quite a few TMs, crystal golem imperators, tukora 
	sentinals and commanders, wicked and nasty skeletons, mad cows, cows, 
	scarecrows, black breath, dark vapors, obliterators, and lots of other 
	stuff. We had a giant wall of cows standing on top of each other, and the 
	hillside was covered with pumpkins from the scarecrows. I collected 228 
	(15960 BU) pumpkins cleaning up the hillside. Replex was given a custom 
	title for killing a herd of mad cows: Mad Cow Slayer. Andante was given the 
	title of Snazzy Dresser. It lasted well over an hour, and was definitely 
	worth missing a few extra xp to go to.&quot;<br>
