	<br>
	Hi there and welcome to the January 22nd edition of the weekly update!<br>
	<br>
	Crowley has finally returned to us today, after his trip to the west coast. 
	He reports that things were fun and he enjoyed the chance to meet with folks 
	at the AC dinner. From all reports the dinner was a success and fun was had 
	by all. Thanks to everyone who attended and those who set things up. Next 
	time it will hopefully be our turn to get things set up. We are hopeful to 
	have more information about another ACPL in the coming weeks. <br>
	<br>
	Over the past week with Crowley out, there were not a lot of decisions made 
	about what was going into the game. We had a few discussions about the 
	direction we should go with the next story arc. A big part of those talks 
	were based directly off feedback we got from folks here on the forums and in 
	the game. <br>
	<br>
	Please remember that the scheduled Live Ops begin this week. Make sure you 
	are ready for it when it is time for your server. You can view the full 
	schedule here. Just as a friendly reminder, here are some tips to help your 
	live event experience go smoother. <br>
	<br>
	1. Make sure if you have any question about what your PC can handle, turn 
	down your graphics ahead of time. This will save you the hassle of doing it 
	in the middle of the event due to performance issues. <br>
	<br>
	2. Some sound cards can draw from system resources. If you are one of the 
	people who runs the game on a lower end machine, turning off the sounds of 
	the game can sometimes help increase overall performance. <br>
	<br>
	3. No matter what level you are please feel free to participate in the 
	event. If you do not know where to go when the event starts, do not be 
	afraid to ask for directions in general chat. The chat is there for a 
	reason. <br>
	<br>
	4. The person or persons running the events will be in character while the 
	event is going on. That means they will not be answering your question about 
	the variances on weapon damage. If you want to ask them about something 
	related to the event, please feel free.<br>
	<br>
	5. It is recommended that you do not send tells to the person running the 
	Live event. They may get the message, but you have a better chance of 
	getting an answer if you ask in local chat. <br>
	<br>
	Last but not least we are happy to let you know that we have some new pets 
	coming soon. Players have been asking for some time now, for pets to be more 
	useful. So coming soon will be some craft buffing pets. These pets will be 
	able to give you temporary buffs to your crafting skill while out. As of 
	right now these pets will buff only one skill per pet and they will buff the 
	four basic crafting skills of Alchemy, Cooking, Fletching, and Lockpick. <br>
	<br>
	We will of course have more information about these pets as we get closer to 
	their release in to the world. Right now we are aiming for them to be a part 
	of the February event, but as always this can change. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hello there and welcome to the February 5th edition of the weekly update. 
	Let’s get right into some of the news for this week coming up. <br>
	<br>
	Our billing folks have been hard at work trying to get new offers together 
	for our loyal customers of Asheron’s Call. We are pleased to announce that 
	Asheron’s Call is now offering multi-month purchasing options. These options 
	will give players a chance to make a one time purchase to pay for their 
	accounts at a discounted rate. This is the first of what we hope are many 
	exciting changes coming to Asheron's Call in the coming months. The 
	available plans are as follows: <br>
	<br>
	3 months -1 time charge of $35.75 ($3 savings)<br>
	6 months -1 time charge of $67.75 ($12 savings)<br>
	12 months -1 time charge of $119.75 ($36 savings)<br>
	<br>
	If you are interested in taking part in one of these great deals, please
	<a target="_blank" href="http://turbine.fuzeqna.com/asheronscall/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=1434">
	click here</a> for more details on how you can sign up today. <br>
	<br>
	As of right now we are still in the process of nailing down the launch date 
	of the February event, Rekindling the Light. As soon as we have the date for 
	the event set, I will make sure and post it.<br>
	<br>
	As pointed out earlier this week by Severlin
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?t=32993">
	here</a> it appears we have finally nailed down that pesky bug which caused 
	some creatures to teleport home. </p>

			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	<p>The scheduled live events have been wrapped up for the month. As far as I 
	have seen and read, most people had a great time, and are enjoying Bur. We 
	would like to thank everyone who participated in the events, and we look 
	forward to doing more of these in the future. <br>
	<br>
	That's about it for this week. Everyone have a great day and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>
	<br>
	<b>Update:</b> As it stands right now, the February event will go live on 
	February 20th. If there is any change to this date, we will let you know 
	here on the forums.<br>

	<p>The best I can do right now is tell you it is being worked on. We have 
	placed some items in our knowledge base that have helped some folks make the 
	game work running Vista. If you are putting a fresh install of the game on 
	your Vista machine the version from the disk will not work, but the install 
	from the download section of our website will get you around the issues 
	caused by the use of IE7.<br>
	<br>
	As far as we can tell the version of Vista that MS gave us to test on, was 
	not the same as the release version. So we have had to start the testing 
	process over again.<br>
	<br>
	We will be getting out a Vista friendly version of the game as soon as we 
	can, but right now I have no ETA for it.<br>

	<p>
	
    Hello there and welcome to the February 12th edition of the weekly update. 
	Let’s get into some of the things going on this week.<br>
	<br>
	In the interest of keeping everyone informed of what is going on, I wanted 
	to give an update on the unexpected downtime last week. After some 
	investigating it appears there was a problem with something on our network 
	where the servers are housed. It does not appear to be anything major, but 
	our Ops team is going to be watching things closely, to be sure. We hope the 
	downtime did not cause too many issues for anyone. <br>
	<br>
	Now on to the good stuff. <br>
	<br>
	This week we are going to focus on something coming in February, The 
	Colosseum. <br>
	This is pretty much what it sounds like. The Colosseum is a dungeon of sorts 
	with repeatable content. The premise is very simple. Players will enter the 
	Colusseum and fight their way through increasingly difficult stages. <br>
	<br>
	Players of any level will be able to participate, but The Colusseum is 
	geared towards fellowships. In order to go through, you must be part of a 
	fellowship. When players enter, they will be in a staging area which will be 
	used by everyone. This is a great place to get your fellowships together, or 
	to find a group to tag along with. Once in a fellowship, one person will 
	need to purchase a ticket at a reasonable cost from a nearby NPC. That 
	person will then give the ticket to the starter NPC who will lock the 
	fellowship and let them know they can enter The Colosseum. <br>
	<br>
	In the interest of full disclosure I will say the initial download time upon 
	entering is a bit longer than most places. The drop is not hot so players 
	are safe upon entrance and should only have to go through this download 
	once. Once you hand in your ticket, your fellowship will have 1 hour to 
	finish the Arena from the time that they start. After this time is up they 
	will all be teleported out of the arena and will be able to speak to the NPC 
	to get their reward. The rewards will depend on how far the fellowship has 
	made it in The Colosseum. If you die in the arena you will be able to 
	re-enter through the first door and then go through all the doors that you 
	have passed through, they will remain open and the creatures will remain 
	dead in previous stages as long as you are within the 1 hour time limit 
	allotted to your fellowship. If this time is up and you still have a corpse 
	in one of the rooms, the normal corpse timer applies. This means that you 
	may need to get some help to run back through for recoveries. Or you may 
	want to prepare ahead of time so that corpse loss will not be an issue. <br>
	<br>
	There will be 5 branches of The Colosseum so 5 fellowships full of players 
	may do The Colosseum every hour. Once a fellowship is inside a branch of The 
	Colosseum, that branch is locked from letting other players in. In the 
	coming months we have plans to further update The Colosseum with things such 
	as Boss fights, which can be unlocked by completing various stages in The 
	Colosseum. <br>
	<br>
	There will be an Authentication downtime on Tuesday February 13th from 7am 
	EST - 12pm EST. During this time, players will not be able to log in to the 
	game. <br>
	<br>
	Last but not least, the February event, <b><i>Rekindling the Light</i></b> 
	is still tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, February 20th.<br>
	<br>
	That's about it for this week. Everyone have a great day and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">anyone can participate, as there are no level

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a defined end, but no matter how far

	</blockquote>
	<p>Yes, there is a way for those higher level folks to skip the first few 
	levels if they so choose.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i>Also, is this an instance dungeon in that only one fellow per

	</blockquote>
	<p>Unfortunately our current tech will not support a queue system on an NPC 
	right now. /e looks over at Severlin. So for the time being it will be a 
	first come first serve type of thing when the notice goes out that a branch 
	of The Colosseum is coming open. </p>

	<p>Rares are allowed to be used. Everyone will however have to kill 
	everything in each section before moving on. There will be no running 
	through and skipping some critters in the room just because you feel like 
	it. Everything must be killed before you can access the next section. </p>

	<p>I could, but what fun would that be? <b>

	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The rewards are based on what level you are 
	and how far you made it through. So if a level 1 makes it all the way 
	through with a fellowship they will get a reward based on their level, not 
	on the level of everyone else.<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Further clearification on this: The &quot;starter&quot; 
	section of the Colosseum, the part that higher level players can elect to 
	skip, gives flat xp no matter the level. This is intended to be rewarding 
	for a lower level character who puts some time into doing this. After that 
	it's pxp.</p><hr width="65%">

	<br>
	At this point I'm wondering if you guys will be able to make it through the 
	Colosseum in its first incarnation. I'm thinking no. I'd love to be proven

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So after getting some feedback from various 
	sources we are making a key change to how The Colosseum works. One of the 
	fears that players brought up was about corpse recovery. Well after some 
	discussion and some magic from Severlin, players who die in The Colosseum 
	will not drop death items. We are hopeful that this will help increase the 
	overall enjoyment of this new area.<br>
