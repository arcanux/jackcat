	<p>
    Adso sat by his camp fire, writing down observations in his journal in a 
	neat and precise hand. Spread out on the ground beside him was a map he had 
	drawn of the Isle of Ruin in the Halaetans, thickly marked with annotations.<br>
	<br>
	He looked up, limbs tense and ears alert, when he heard the sounds of 
	footsteps nearby. He relaxed when he recognized the pattern of the 
	footfalls. The younger acolyte was approaching beneath the rocky ridge upon 
	which Adso had established his camp. He looked down onto the valley floor 
	beneath and saw her approaching. As she drew closer to the firelight, he saw 
	that her leather armor had been perforated and slashed in multiple 
	locations. He jumped to his feet, blade in one hand, signaling with the 
	other. He flashed a hand sign, asking if she was in trouble or being 
	followed.<br>
	<br>
	The acolyte returned the &quot;all okay&quot; signal, and Adso relaxed long enough for 
	her come up to the fire and stand directly in front of him. &quot;What news, 
	Sabithra?&quot; he asked her.<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra sighed wearily and dropped a heavy pack by the fire. &quot;Tough 
	hunting,&quot; she said, waving her hand dismissively as she sat down. &quot;I got 
	everything Master asked for, and more besides, though.&quot; She crossed her 
	legs, poured some water into a kettle, and began heating the kettle on the 
	fire. &quot;Tea?&quot; she asked him.<br>
	<br>
	He nodded cautiously, looking her over to see that she was properly 
	recovered from her recent fight. They were in dangerous territory, and if 
	she was slowed by her wounds in any way, they might both pay the price of 
	another trip to the lifestone.<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra's presence was the latest sign of his Master's growing trust in 
	him. He'd recently been given charge of the young acolyte's training, and 
	this trip through the most dangerous of the Halaetan Isles was their first 
	major hunting excursion together. He had dispatched her to collect a list of 
	creature trophies that their Master had requested, while he had gone around 
	to map out some new fortified camps in the Shattered Out-Lands. She was a 
	talented fighter, but he suspected the real reason Master had assigned her 
	to him was to test his own patience.<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra glanced at Adso's map and her eyes widened. &quot;So Master was right. 
	They have been moving around.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded. &quot;Yes, and it seems to me that they are going to start building 
	further fortifications soon. I do not know what it portends, but analysis is 
	not our task. We are merely here to observe and document their movements.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;And to collect monster guts, apparently,&quot; she said, grimacing in distaste 
	as she eyed her pack full of ichor-spattered body parts. &quot;Don't we have 
	better things to hunt? Like, say, people?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It is not for you to question Master's orders,&quot; Adso snapped. &quot;Trust me, if 
	I'd taken that tone with Master as a wet-behind-the-ears acolyte, I would be 
	lying in a patch of red snow right now.&quot; He locked eyes with her. She met 
	his gaze defiantly. He put the force of his will into his own eyes, as the 
	Master had taught him. He'd come to call it the &quot;blank stare of hate&quot; 
	whenever he found himself under the Master's own cold gaze of disapproval.<br>
	<br>
	After a time, Sabithra looked away. &quot;As you say, Elder Brother Adso.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso nodded in approval. &quot;Good. Now tell me of your hunting trip.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	By way of answering, she opened the pack and rooted through the pile of body 
	parts. &quot;The strangest thing occurred... I was attacked by a pair of masked 
	men. I defeated them, though they did cut me up pretty well. Each of them 
	had one of these ...&quot; She dug something out of her pack, dripping with gore. 
	She flicked off some of the fluids and held it up to the light. It was a 
	small, star-shaped piece of metal, but it glimmered in the firelight with 
	the sheen of gold.<br>
	<br>
	Adso's journal fell to the ground from nerveless fingers. His jaw dropped, 
	and he snatched the golden star out of her hand. He inspected it closely 
	against the firelight.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The men who attacked you... Each had one of these?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's just a shuriken, Adso. Not that different from the kind you can buy 
	from any weapon merchant in the Sho lands... What, didn't Master teach you 
	about them?&quot; She smirked sardonically at him.<br>
	<br>
	Adso stood, eyes alight with rage. The smirk vanished from Sabithra's face 
	when she saw how angry he was.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Foolish woman,&quot; he hissed. &quot;It's not just a shuriken.&quot; He quickly packed 
	his journal and map away and kicked dirt over the fire, some of which washed 
	over the teapot.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Hey! My teapot!&quot; Sabithra protested.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pack your things. We are leaving now. We are going to see Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;But what about the trip to Sanamar? I was really hoping to—&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso grabbed her wrist with iron-hard fingers and yanked her to her feet. 
	&quot;We are going to see Master. We will show him what you found, and you will 
	tell him everything about your hunting trip. And by Pwyll's bloody red 
	bones, if you smirk or make any smart comments, or whine about your orders, 
	I will bleed you myself and leave your corpse behind for the Eaters. If 
	that's not enough to make you shape up, Master will bleed you, and there 
	won't be any waking from that. Are we clear?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra straightened her posture, now fully obedient to her angry Elder 
	Brother. &quot;Yes, Elder Brother Adso, I understand.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Good. Now get your damn teapot and let's go.&quot;</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Ulgrim sat cross-legged in the shadow of the Smoking 
	Axe Tavern in Ayan Baqur, tracing strange patterns in the dirt. A shadow 
	appeared, looming over him and obscuring the patterns he was tracing. He 
	looked up and squinted in the harsh sunlight of the desert town.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Eh? Who goes there? You're blocking my light!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I apologize, Uncle,&quot; the stranger replied, shifting slightly to the side.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim blinked a few times, then stood up to embrace his nephew. &quot;Ardry, my 
	boy! Where have you been?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Will you remember if I tell you, Uncle?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim considered that for a moment. &quot;Probably not. So let's not waste time 
	talking about it! What brings you to my town?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ah, well, I wanted to consult with you about a strange artifact I found...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Of course, of course, my boy. There's no one who knows more about strange 
	artifacts than I do!&quot; Ulgrim rubbed his hands together. &quot;But first, be a 
	friend and get me a mug of stout, would you?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Okay, Uncle, I'll go get you some stout, but while I'm in there I want you 
	to examine this...&quot; Ardry pulled out a small velvet bag from his pack and 
	placed it in Ulgrim's hand. It was heavy for its size and felt like it had 
	an apple or a small fruit inside. &quot;Mind you keep it discreet, as it is... 
	very shiny.&quot; That said, he walked through the tavern's threshold and 
	disappeared within.<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim snorted at his nephew's concern and upended the bag, spilling its 
	contents into his palm. He let out a low whistle and immediately covered the 
	object between both hands. It was a huge red gem, a ruby most likely, that 
	seemed to possess a core of darkness. He turned his back so that the walls 
	of the tavern would obscure what he was doing, and examined its many 
	flawless facets. Ardry came back outside with two mugs of stout in his 
	hands.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Great galloping Golems, my boy! Where did you get this?&quot; He accepted one 
	mug from Ardry and quaffed half of it in one gulp, wiping his mouth on the 
	sleeve of his robe.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;From an undead lord, in a recently uncovered crypt. I was asked to find it 
	by a new and somewhat suspicious character who's taken up residence near 
	Zaikhal. I need to know if you can tell anything about it, before I give it 
	to him. I've been in situations like this before. I know what kind of havoc 
	can lurk in the center of a suspiciously colored gem. I don't want to 
	accidentally unleash the Hopeslayer, or anything like that.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim shook the gem while holding it to his ear. &quot;Well, on that account you 
	can rest easy. I don't think there's any Hopeslayer in here. It does look 
	very odd, though, doesn't it?&quot; He paused, then held it to his nose and took 
	a deep, rumbling snort. &quot;Nope, doesn't smell particularly Bael'Zharonish, 
	either, though that can be hard to tell. I say though, it does smell 
	strangely familiar, like some other rubies I've come across...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim slipped the gem back into its bag and handed the bag back to Ardry. 
	&quot;I'd recommend you take it to Aliester and see what he can make of it. He's 
	the gem expert.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry sighed. &quot;I know. I was hoping to avoid a journey all the way out 
	there, just to endure another hour-long lecture on the geomantic properties 
	of boiled river mud. I thought a nice mug of stout with my favorite uncle 
	would be preferable.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim gave his nephew a sly look. &quot;Oh, very sweet. A mug of stout with your 
	favorite uncle, eh? Why, if only your mother was around, so I could tell her 
	what a kind and dutiful boy she raised... But honestly now, you've got 
	something else on your mind, I can tell.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry sighed, a little embarrassed, and drew another velvet bag from his 
	pack. This one was slightly larger than the previous one. He handed the bag 
	to his uncle, who took it from him with a suspicious glare.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Now, before you open this, Uncle –&quot; Ardry began, but it was too late. 
	Ulgrim opened the bag and dropped the contents into his hand again. It was 
	an egg, and very obviously not a chicken egg. Ulgrim grinned and licked his 
	lips. &quot;How nice, you brought me a hard-boiled egg for lunch. You know, I was 
	just thinking of how hungry I was... Fetch me some salt and pepper, would 
	you?&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Before Ardry could protest, Ulgrim knocked the egg against his boot to crack 
	it. He was ready to start peeling off pieces of shell when it twitched and 
	squeaked. He shrieked, a high-pitched wail of terror, and dropped the egg.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry gave a wordless cry of dismay and dove for the egg. He hit the ground, 
	and it sounded like a few things in his pack broke as he did, but he managed 
	to catch the egg and save it from hitting the hard-packed desert dirt.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What kind of hard-boiled egg is that?!?&quot; Ulgrim yelled in shock.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Not a hard-boiled egg at all, Uncle.&quot; Both men watched in fascination as 
	the shell cracked all the way around, and bits and fragments of it cascaded 
	from Ardry's cupped hands. The baby animal that had been concealed within 
	the egg twisted and squeaked again. Once all the shell pieces had been 
	sloughed off, Ulgrim saw that it was a very small Armoredillo. It looked at 
	him with small, beady, but undeniably cute eyes.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I didn't bring you lunch, Uncle,&quot; Ardry sighed, still prone on the ground 
	with the baby Armoredillo cradled in his hands. &quot;I brought you a pet. Don't 
	feed it any stout.&quot;</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello there and welcome to the September Letter to the 
	Players!<br>
	<br>
	With Grael finally defeated the people of Dereth can now breathe a sigh of 
	relief. The sky has now returned to normal and the sun is once again a 
	bright spot crossing it. Now is a time for celebration as we approach Fall 
	and the Festival season. The celebrations this year should be grand, as the 
	people of Dereth have once again proven they can overcome any foe. <br>
	<br>
	Now let's see what's new and exciting this month in Asheron's Call!<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b><br>
	<br>
	With the Launch of Throne of Destiny, a tremendously dangerous area was 
	added on the Isle of Ruin in the Halatean Isles. This valley has generally 
	been avoided by most players, other than those who are traveling to dungeons 
	near this valley. In order to make this area more useful to players who 
	prefer outdoor hunting, we have begun making revisions to this area starting 
	this month. This is a work in progress and in the coming months we will 
	continue to work on improving this area. <br>
	<br>
	This month we are introducing Non Combat Pets into Dereth. These pets have 
	no combat features to start with, and are there solely to look cute. While 
	we would love to add combat pets into the game, at this stage we want to 
	make sure that any pets added fit into the overall balance of the game and 
	don't throw that balance out of whack. At the start you will have 4 pets to 
	choose from; an Armoredillo, Drudge, Thrugus, and of course the cute Ursuin. 
	Players will be able to have all four pets, but only one pet per player is 
	allowed out at a time. The Pets will not be killable, and they will not be 
	able to block doorways or entrances of any kind. <br>
	<br>
	Another new feature being added this month is Uninscription Stones. These 
	are just what they sound like. Players will be able to purchase the stones 
	from a vendor for a fee. Once they have the stone they can use it on any 
	loot generated non unique item to remove the inscription from that item. If 
	you have a player inscription on a quest item, the stone will not remove the 
	inscription. It will also not remove the inscription from items such as the 
	Pack Cow. <br>
	<br>
	NPC's will now recognize that the stack size of Pyreals has been increased 
	to 25000. Last month the NPC's did not get the memo about the increase in 
	the Pyreal stack size. This made the change less exciting for those who had 
	been asking for this change. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept<br>
	</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. With each 
	monthly event we will be discussing an in concept topic, in order to give 
	you as much information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	One of things we are looking at going forward is how we can improve 
	crafting. We know this is a kind of broad statement, but at this point we 
	are looking at the crafting system as a whole and trying to determine what 
	changes can be made to improve this already robust system. When we have more 
	specific details on this we will post more information on what direction we 
	want to go and what improvements will be made. <br>
	<br>
	We are also investigating the possibility of Buffing Pets. These are pets 
	that can cast simple buffs on the person who controls them. This of course 
	brings up balance questions, so we are taking things very slowly when it 
	comes to any pet skills we add to the game. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	September and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed 
	here, there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game 
	for the September event.</span></p>
