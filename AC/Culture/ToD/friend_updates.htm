	- Aug. 25, 2005</b></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear AC1 
	subscribers, <br>
	<br>
	After significant consideration, we have decided to move the AC1 live team 
	back to Massachusetts. This is the right decision to support AC1 going 
	forward, allowing us to better coordinate between the game and support 
	teams. <br>
	<br>
	During this transition, we plan to provide uniquely fun live events for 
	everyone to enjoy. <br>
	<br>
	Best regards, <br>

	A few comments, just to address some concerns I figure some of you may have.<br>
	<br>
	Q: Will this delay the next update?<br>
	A: It’s too early to tell as it depends on how smoothly the transition goes. 
	At this point though, I’d say it’s likely. We will hopefully start some of 
	the events next week though.<br>
	<br>
	Q: How does this effect the plans for CA Turbine Nation?<br>
	A: Unfortunately, since the AC1 team will be here in Massachusetts, we will 
	have to cancel the west coast event. Because of the timing of all of this 
	unfortunately TN got caught in the middle.<br>
	<br>
	Q: Does this impact your ability to handle server, billing, or customer 
	support?<br>
	A: No. Net Ops, billing, and customer support are already handled out of 
	Massachusetts.<br>

	Calandryll</a>)<b> - </b>Aug. 26, 2005</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The future of AC1</b><br>
	As I said in the previous post, we have no plans to shut down AC1 at this 
	time. It’s not something we want to do and it’s not something we are 
	planning to do. Nobody can predict the future of course, but right now we 
	intend to support AC1.<br>
	<br>
	<b>The move </b><br>
	People in CA just found out about this yesterday and most probably haven’t 
	made any decisions yet. While I fully expect that some folks will decide not 
	to make the move, I hope that many do. Once we know who is coming back to MA 
	and who is not that will give us a better idea as to the future of live 
	development. I know you guys want more specifics than that, but right now I 
	simply don’t have any. The moment I do, I will let you know.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live events</b><br>
	As most of you read, it is our plan to run live events during the transition 
	period for the CA staff. I’ve been asked to coordinate those events with 
	some folks here and I’d like your feedback as to the kinds of things you’d 
	like to see. I know live events aren’t exactly the same as new development, 
	but I am hoping we can create some fun stuff for people to do in the game. 
	Our plan is to start these events next week. We’ll probably start small and 
	then build up steam as we continue on. <br>
	<br>
	<b>About me</b><br>
	I know most of you don’t know me very well. I haven’t been on these boards 
	as much as I’d like. Actually I haven’t been on any of Turbine’s boards as 
	much as I’d like – goes with the territory of working on multiple projects I 
	guess. But I can tell you that my focus right now is on AC1, on getting the 
	live events running and communicating with all of you the most up to date 
	information that I have.<br>
	<br>
	I’m hoping this post puts some of your fears to rest. I totally understand 
	the anxiety that the announcements have caused and I’ll be here as much as I 
	can to help answer questions.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks everyone.<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I wanted to give everyone a quick update on 
	the status of a couple of issues.<br>
	<br>
	1. The September update. I met with the QA team and went over the current 
	bugs for the update this morning. We prioritized and assigned all of them. 
	I'll update you again once we have a better idea as to how quickly we can 
	get these fixed. We're still shooting to have an update in September, but 
	there are still a few factors that will impact whether we make it or not.<br>
	<br>
	2. Live events. I had a very productive meeting with the folks who will be 
	running the events. Right now we are focusing on documenting everything and 
	creating a schedule. We should be able to start running events late this 
	week or early next week. I'll keep you posted.<br>
	<br>
	That's the latest for now. Should anything change I'll let you know.<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As promised, I'll be writing these updates on 
	a daily basis. Sometimes there won't be a lot of news, other times there 
	will be. Today we have quite a bit to report.<br>
	<br>
	As most of you already know, Srand, Ibn, and Meanbeard have decided to leave 
	the AC team. Everyone at Turbine wishes them the best of luck in their 
	future endeavors. We’ll have a good idea as to how things will shake down 
	next week, so I ask that you please bare with us during this transition. <br>
	<br>
	I don’t have any new information on Dawnsong or the September update yet. 
	Those are both still very high on my radar though. Live events are still 
	scheduled to start next week...more info on that soon.<br>
	<br>
	Another update – the Decal folks have entered their first phase of Alpha. 
	You can read their press release here:<br>

	Some other interesting news. As some of you may know Turbine recently 
	attended the Penny Arcade Expo. We had game stations for DDO, LOTRO and 
	Asheron’s Call at the booth. The Asheron’s Call stations allowed players to 
	use their existing account or create a new one to try out the game. The 
	station got a lot of attention and people were playing the game for almost 
	the entire show. We also gave away a bunch of copies of ToD as door prizes 
	and other giveaways. I think AC was well represented at PAX.<br>

	http://x2.putfile.com/8/23914350456.jpg</a><br>
	<br>
	And last, but certainly not least...we’ve hired our new Asheron’s Call 
	Community Specialist! Some of you may already know him as Frelorn. Frelorn 
	has been an AC customer support representative for almost two years and has 
	helped moderate these forums from time to time. He’s also been an Asheron’s 
	Call player since the beginning and is extremely knowledgeable about the 
	game. Frelorn is going to be working on the live events for now, so I’ll 
	still be the main point of contact for all of you on the boards. Once the 
	events get into full swing, he’ll take a greater role on the boards. <br>
	<br>
	Please join me in welcoming Frelorn to the Community Relations team!<br>

	<p>Not a lot to report today, but I wanted to post anyway just to keep you 
	all in the loop.<br>
	<br>
	We've made some progress on the September update. That's obviously a good

	<p>Just a couple of updates today.<br>
	<br>
	Hurricane Katrina has devastated the lives of many people and for most, 
	logging into a game is the very last thing on their minds. In order to make 
	sure nobody loses their house, we will be refreshing housing maintenance 
	across all servers automatically for the foreseeable future. Frelorn will be 
	logging in and running the necessary command on all servers in order to make 
	sure the house maintenance is paid. In fact, he just ran the command on the 
	servers about an hour ago.<br>
	<br>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage all of you to donate 
	what you can to help the victims of this disaster. You can contribute to the 
	Red Cross at the following link:<br>
	http://store.yahoo.com/redcross-donate2/<br>
	<br>
	Even a little bit helps. Thank you.<br>

	<p>Hope everyone had a great Labor Day weekend. We had lots going on at the 
	office this past week and there is a lot of news to tell…<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update<br>
	</b>We are very excited about the progress we have made on Asheron’s Call in 
	the past week. We still have people working on the September update which 
	looks great. It is our goal to get this update out in September and I will 
	continue to update you on the progress. Of course, we expected to lose a 
	little time during the move back to Massachusetts, but we planned for that 
	and our goal is to get the update ready to go before the move. Once the live 
	team is here, we’ll evaluate the team structure; not everyone has decided to 
	make the move back, which we expected would be the case.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	Live events have begun!! The schedule is set, the planning is complete, and 
	Frelorn has already run a couple events! The plan right now calls for 3 to 4 
	events per week per server. They will run from around noon until late in the 
	evening, Monday through Saturday. Keep in mind that we are rotating the 
	event schedule so just because your server doesn’t have one today or has one 
	while you aren’t online doesn’t mean you won’t have a chance to participate 
	in another event at a different time and date. We’ll be running similar 
	events on each server each week to ensure as many people have a chance to 
	participate as possible. We also specifically chose a couple ideas from the 
	Live Event Idea thread and will be continuing to take ideas from all of you 
	as we progress. Keep an eye on the Asheron’s Call website for recaps and 
	screenshots of the events!<br>
	<br>
	That pretty much covers all of the news I have for today. Apologies for 
	posting this later in the day than usual. There was something I was waiting 
	for confirmation on before posting but it's not confirmed yet. Hopefully 
	tomorrow...and yes, it's good news.<br>
	<br>
	Again, I greatly appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding through 
	all of this. I plan on continuing to update all of you with information as I 
	have it. If you find these updates useful I’d like to continue doing them 
	indefinitely.<br>

    <p><b>hello (again) from Crowley - 9/7/05 </b>(</span><a target="_blank" href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=238775#post238775">by 
	Crowley</a>)</p>
	<p>Hey everyone,<br>
	<br>
	I just wanted to send a message out to those of you who are concerned about 
	the state of Asheron’s Call as it moves back to Boston. I’m Dave “Crowley” 
	Javier, and I am one of the team members who’ve been in the LA studio for 
	the last fifteen months or so. I was Lead Designer on Throne of Destiny, and 
	I also was a member of the first Live team when Asheron’s Call shipped in 
	1999. Since we wrapped work on Throne of Destiny, I’ve been working with the 
	rest of the Live team on our monthly events. I hope you enjoyed August, and 
	I am eager to continue work on further Asheron’s Call events. Fear not for 
	the status of the September event. Most of the work is already done. 
	Obviously the transition of the project and the team back to Boston has 
	caused some disruption, but people on both coasts are working hard to ship 
	September and to ensure that the ongoing content suffers minimal 
	interruption.<br>
	<br>
	I’d like to thank you all for playing our game, and I look forward moving 
	ahead with the game when I go back to Boston.<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>
	<br>
	Crowley<br>

    <p><b>My New Role at Turbine - 9/7/05 </b>(</span><a target="_blank" href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=238780#post238780">by 
	Scenario</a>)</p>
	<p>For over five years I have been, in one form or another, a part of this 
	community. Many of you have helped me on quests (whether you know it or 
	not). We’ve fought along side each other against the threats of Bael’zharon, 
	the Virindi, and Gaerlan. I was fortunate enough to have been part of the 
	team that has pitted you against the Olthoi, Burun, and Viamontians.<br>
	<br>
	Asheron’s Call brought my friends and me together through college and kept 
	us together afterwards. It brought me here to Turbine and gave me some 
	amazing opportunities to grow both creatively and professionally.<br>
	<br>
	After being a member of the Asheron’s Call Development team for two and a 
	half years, I am moving on to another project within Turbine. I am happy 
	knowing that I’ve left the team in good hands and that I have had the 
	opportunity to work with them and work for this great community. It only 
	took me two of those years to convince you all that I wasn’t Sean Huxter 
	(though I suspect that some of you still aren’t quite convinced). :P <br>
	<br>
	My decision to leave the Asheron’s Call Live Team came several weeks before 
	the announcement of the closure of the Santa Monica studio. I was in the 
	middle of a vacation when the announcement was released, moving from Santa 
	Monica back to the east coast, and had heard nothing of what had happened 
	until I stopped by the office to visit early last week. I’m going to miss 
	working on Asheron’s Call, and I am looking forward to returning to the 
	project that started my career here at Turbine as a member of the Lord of 
	the Rings World Building team.<br>
	<br>
	While the September event is my last Live Event, my presence will still be 
	felt over numerous following months. I’ve left the Live team with a lot of 
	brand new monster art that they will be filtering in over the coming months, 
	starting with September. I will also remain available to the Live Team to 
	answer their questions (and your questions), offer suggestions and lend them 
	a helping hand if need be.<br>
	<br>
	For September, those of you with an eye for dungeon exploration will get to 
	see the first appearance of the second place Make-A-Monster contest winner. 
	The Shallows Sharks, no longer content to look like their “land-lubbing” kin 
	will have a brand new set of textures, just for them! In addition to that, 
	we will also be introducing another brand new creature – the deep sea 
	dwelling Remoran (some of you may recognize this creature; it has been a 
	part of our data for years though it did receive a substantial facelift)! 
	Lastly, numerous NPCs throughout our September content will be previewing 
	some of the other new monster looks to come.<br>
	<br>
	I look forward to being a player again. I’ll see you in Dereth.<br>

	<p>Bunch of stuff today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	Not much new to report on the September update. Things are moving along well 
	though. We have a follow-up status meeting on Thursday. <br>
	<br>
	You probably saw Scenario’s post. While those of us on the AC team are sad 
	to loose him to another project, we’re very happy that he’s with Turbine and 
	he has been helping us (and me personally) a lot with the September update 
	and other AC issues. Dave “Crowley” Javier also posted a quick update on the 
	work he is doing on the September update as well.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Open Issues</b><br>
	I know you guys have a lot of questions about some open issues such as the 
	high-res textures, new artwork, Dawnsong, etc. I don’t want anyone to think 
	I am blowing off those concerns. I just don’t have an update for you on 
	them. Right now our focus is on the September Update, live events, the move, 
	and the day-to-day activity of keeping the service going. That’s not to say 
	there isn’t room for other suggestions or concerns, but I did want to be 
	upfront and let you know that right now our focus is on those things. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	The Live Events went well yesterday and participation was great! If you 
	missed yesterday’s events, don’t worry. We’ll be doing plenty more. We’ve 
	also posted an account of one of the events on the website along with 
	screenshots. <br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=391">
	http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=391</a><br>
	<br>
	We’ll be posting these about twice a week to give everyone a chance to see 
	what occurred during some of the events. I also want to start getting more 
	content on the site and this is the first step towards that. If you take 
	part in an event and want to submit your own account of what transpired 
	please feel free to e-mail it to us along with screenshots to ac1stories@turbine.com. 
	I’d really like to start getting your stories on the site as well as our 
	content. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Message Boards</b><br>
	I’ve lowered the post delay timer from 360 seconds to 90 seconds. We’ll 
	tweak that number depending on how things go, but 6 minutes seems a little 
	too high to me. If everything goes fine, I’ll keep it at 90 seconds.<br>

	<b>Last but not Least</b><br>
	I don’t have an update on that good news I mentioned yesterday yet. Just to 
	clarify though, the news doesn’t have anything to do with development. It 
	probably won’t affect most of you directly, but it’s something I think 
	people will be happy to hear we are doing. I am hoping we can announce it by 
	Friday.<br>

	<p>Quick update today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	Bug fixing is moving along well. We have our status meeting later today so 
	I'll have a better idea as to how close we are to releasing the September 
	update by tomorrow. Again, probably won't have a set date yet though.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	We ran a bunch of live events yesterday and some more today. I'm pretty 
	happy with how these are progressing so far. We're starting with some basic 
	monster spawn events and will continue to ramp them up over time. I had the 
	chance to watch over Frelorn's shoulder during one of the events and it 
	looked like the players were having a blast. I hope that over the coming 
	weeks you all get a chance to participate. We'll be posting another event 
	recap tomorrow.<br>
	<br>
	Hurrican Katrina and Billing<br>
	I can finally tell you all what that good news is that I mentioned earlier 
	in the week. <br>
	<br>
	Because most people affected by hurricane Katrina probably cannot access 
	their account or call our billing department, in addition to automatically 
	paying house maintenance we have also decided to stop billing for those 
	people in the affected states. This is effective immediately and will 
	continue for the foreseeable future. This required some work on our billing 
	system which is why we couldn't do it right away. I wanted to wait until the 
	work was completed and tested before announcing anything.<br>

	<p>Two quick things today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	We had out meeting to discuss the September Update. There are quite a few 
	bugs, but they are being addressed. We probably won’t be able to make a “go, 
	no go” decision until next week. The move is probably going to happen at the 
	end of the month, so we’d want to get the update out before that in case 
	anything needs to be addressed. We wouldn’t want to release the update while 
	people may be out of touch. As always, I’ll keep you posted.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	Another recap was posted today. Two actually! You can read about them
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=392">here</a>. So 
	far we’ve hit our schedule almost perfectly, so we’ll continue with the 3-4 
	events per server per week goal. <br>
	<br>
	Well, that’s it for today’s update. I hope everyone has a great weekend!<br>

	Calandryll</a>)</p>
	<p>Hope everyone had a great weekend. Most of mine was spent reading the 
	boards, doing some scheduling for AC, playing some poker, and watching my 
	Steelers trounce the Titans!
	<img class="inlineimg" title="smile" alt="" src="friend/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"> 
	Now onto the update…<br>
	<br>
	Just a reminder about what these daily updates are. I’ll include anything 
	that I have new information on and things that we are currently working on. 
	So if something doesn’t appear here, it doesn’t mean it has been forgotten, 
	it just means I don’t have new information about it today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	There are still a number of bugs that need to be fixed, but the team 
	continues to work hard to resolve them. Our goal is to have the bugs fixed 
	by Wednesday so we can do the last part of our test procedure and get the 
	update out the following week. So Wednesday is pretty much going to be the 
	key date for us. We’re already talking about coming in this weekend if we 
	need to and if it will make a difference. Again, I will continue to keep all 
	of you posted as new information develops.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	Events will continue this week. We had a pretty good first week and I am 
	looking forward to seeing even more.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Decal</b><br>
	The Decal developers posted an update regarding their Alpha status. You can 
	read it here:<br>

	<p>Not much to report today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	We prioritized a bunch of new bugs this morning. Most of them were pretty 
	minor so I don't expect the new bugs to have a major impact on our schedule. 
	We do have some others though that are a bit trickier and that we are still 
	resolving. How well those go will be the biggest factor going forward. Our 
	publish status meeting is tomorrow afternoon. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events<br>
	</b>These are going well although I've asked Frelorn to help our QA team a 
	little with the regression of some of the easier bugs, so he might have to 
	reorganize his event schedule a bit. We'll still be running plenty of events 
	though.<br>

	Calandryll</a>)</p>
	<p>Again not a lot to report today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Server Downtime</b><br>
	I gotta start with this since it is the most pressing issue at the moment. 
	We're still investigating the problem with the servers and our ops team is 
	diligently working to resolve the problem. Unfortunately we expect that this 
	downtime is going to last into the evening hours and that there will 
	probably be a rollback to the last backup at 6am EST this morning. As soon 
	as we know more we will let you know immediately. This issue pretty much has 
	everyone's attention right now.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update<br>
	</b>We found a major bug last night with the global chat system that turned 
	out not to be a bug. Don't ask. So things are still moving along and we have 
	our status meeting later today. Thursday's update should have some more 
	information for all of you. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	We posted an update about the recent live events. You can read about the 
	events here:<br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=393">
	http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=393</a><br>
	<br>
	Don't forget to send us your own write-ups for events you participate in to 
	ac1stories@turbine.com.<br>
	<br>
	That covers everything. Aside from the publish status meeting later today 
	right now I'm focusing on getting more information about this downtime. I'll 
	post as soon as I have more information.<br>

    <p><b>Daily Update - 9/15/05 </b>(</span><a target="_blank" href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=240933#post240933">by 
	Calandryll</a>)</p>
	<p>Lots of stuff today!<br>
	<br>
	<b>Server Downtime</b><br>
	First, I want to apologize again for the downtime last night. Our Ops team 
	was here until 1am making sure everything was stable even after the servers 
	came up, so I wanted to recognize their effots in this post as well.<br>
	<br>
	I also want to thank all of you for being so patient with us while we fixed 
	the problem. I’m not kidding when I say I am proud of how the AC community 
	handled this. It is that, more than anything, that makes me want to do 
	something to make it up to you all. More on that later in this update.<br>
	<br>
	<b>September Update</b><br>
	Yesterday’s status meeting went really well. Despite a few more bugs we’ve 
	gotten the publish to a state where we believe it will be ready by next 
	week. We’re targeting Wednesday, September 21st for the publish. The move is 
	the following week, so if we miss that date we miss September. Needless to 
	say we all REALLY want to get this done this month. So we’re pushing hard 
	and will be here on the weekend to cover all the bases. Assuming all goes 
	well, I’ll probably post a Letter to the Players on Monday. If something 
	goes wrong and we think we’re going to miss that date I will let you know. 
	But right now we’re feeling pretty good about it.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Double XP</b><br>
	Because of last night’s downtime, we’ll be turning on double-XP starting 
	today at around 6pm EDT and ending on Monday at approximately 6pm EDT. This 
	should give people who play on weekdays and weekends a chance to get some 
	extra XP. Some of you suggested we should do double-XP next Wednesday, but 
	I’d rather not do that on a publish day. Maybe we’ll do double-XP on another 
	Wednesday though. Just to be clear, double-XP does require ToD and we can’t 
	change that for now. We know some of you don’t have ToD yet and we’re going 
	to account for that as well with some live events.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	Next week we’re going to do some live events geared towards helping people 
	gain XP. This is to make up for the fact that some people can’t play during 
	the double-XP time and some people don’t have ToD. We’ll be posting a 
	schedule on Friday. Again, we understand that some people will miss out on 
	the events, but I think between double-XP and the events most of you should 
	get some benefit.<br>
	<br>
	That covers everything for today.<br>

	This is currently active. We also accidentally increased the majors drop 
	rate. We turned this back off though. We might do this at a later date, but 
	we didn't want this active this time.<br>

	Calandryll</a>) - 9-17-05</p>
	<p>It's amazing how many people on various projects are in the office on 
	Saturdays. It's really great to work at a company that has so many dedicated 
	people in it.<br>
	<br>
	Obviously I don't have much to report since yesterday, but I wanted to write 
	a Daily Update today just to let you know how hard to team is working on the 
	September Update. I'm currently writing the first draft of the Letter to the 
	Players (it's really long!) so we should have no problem posting it on 
	Monday.<br>
	<br>
	I hope everyone is enjoying the double-xp weekend and we look forward to 
	running the xp-oriented events next week. As always, I'll keep you updated 
	on the status of the September update, but so far everything still looks 
	good.<br>
