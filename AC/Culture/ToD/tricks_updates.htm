	<p>Hi there folks. I hope everyone is having a good day. <br>
	<br>
	Some things to update today. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Known issues with the October event: </b><br>
	The Splinter of Wood that you you can loot off of some scarecrows is tied to 
	the same quest flag as it was last year when we used it for the Ulgrims robe 
	last year. If you find you can not pick up the splinter, please contact 
	customer service and they will be able to resolve this for you.<br>
	<br>
	The spell Taste for Blood on the Mukkir Orb is overriding Major Weapon 
	tinkering,when the opposite should be occuring.<br>
	<br>
	It has also been brought to our attention that Ulgrim has been speaking of a 
	strange hatch. Please keep in mind that not everything Ulgrim says should be 
	taken seriously. He has been known to ramble a bit. <br>
	<br>
	We know that some of you are upset about the recent changes we have made to 
	the Gold spawns and we have commented on the changes
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?p=249038#post249038">
	here</a> and
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?p=249159#post249159">
	here</a>. <br>
	We will be continuing to read your feedback on the matter, not only here but 
	on other forums and in-game. <br>
	<br>
	Thats about it for now. I hope everyone has a great day!<br>

	<p>It has come to our attention that some people in game have been sending 
	other players links which can cause a virus to be installed if the person 
	goes to that link. Any player caught giving out malicious links will be 
	permanently banned.<br>
	<br>
	In the meantime we ask that you not click on any links given to you by any 
	players. This is the best way to prevent any harmful effects.<br>

    <p><b>PvP Improvements</b> -<b> 11/11/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=251201#post251201">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>We know that the PvP community has been feeling a bit left out as of 
	late, and we want to rectify this as soon as we can. Anything we add or 
	change that involves PvP requires a lot of testing to make sure that it can 
	be balanced. That being said, we wanted to come here and get your feedback 
	on a couple of the ideas that we had mind. Please understand that we have 
	not tested these ideas nor have we ironed out all the technical barriers to 
	implementation. But before we go ahead and attempt something like this we 
	want you, the players to let us know what you think. Now, I know what you 
	will say… What about the ideas we have already given to you? We still would 
	like to implement some of these ideas, but a lot of them require a great 
	amount of tech time and testing, and we do not want to rush into anything 
	that could make things worse instead of better.<br>
	<br>
	The first idea we have discussed is a way for players to add a moderate 
	bonus to any pre-existing Slayer effect on whatever weapon they are wielding 
	at the time. There of course would be limitations to this so that it could 
	not be exploited or abused.<br>
	<br>
	The second idea was along the same lines as the one listed above, except 
	this would be a way to add a moderate bonus to the attack mod of the weapon 
	you are wielding. The same rules would apply, meaning there would be some 
	limitations to this so that the ability would not be abused. Also note that 
	the bonus to the attack mod would be on top of any tinkering that may have 
	been done to the weapon.<br>
	<br>
	What we want from you the players is feedback on what you think about these 
	two ideas. I will again say that we have not even tested this yet and we are 
	not sure that the current tech will allow us to do these things. We felt it 
	was important to get your feedback on these things before we went forward 
	with attempting any of these ideas.<br>

	<p>As mentioned before, we pulled the respec timer out of November in order 
	to incorporate more of your feedback. Originally we thought we'd only make 
	small changes, but after going through the ideas, it turns out the design 
	for the respec timers was a little bit bigger of a change to the original 
	system than we first intended it to be.<br>
	<br>
	So instead of waiting until after November, we're posting it now to get your 
	feedback as early as possible. We think these changes make the system a lot 
	more useable and much cooler.<br>

	<p>Good afternoone everyone. I hope that you all had a great weekend. We 
	have a couple of things to update for you, so let's get right to it.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Katrina Billing</b><br>
	We have decided to extend the free billing period for players in the areas 
	affected by Hurricane Katrina until January 1st 2006. After this date all 
	subscriptions will return to their normal billing cycles. We will also 
	continue to pay in-game housing maintenance for all players until that same 
	date.<br>
	<br>
	Quick Addition: We are aware that a few players in the affected areas were 
	billed in early November. We are looking into this and will post an update 
	soon.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Account Migration</b><br>
	On December 7th 2005 we will be turning off the ability to migrate accounts 
	through our three point authentication system or through our billing 
	department. This change is being made due a necessary update to our billing 
	system. If you have any accounts that you have not migrated by this point 
	you will not have the ability to do so after December 6th 2005. <br>
	<br>
	We are also continuing to get your feedback on the spec/respec timers and 
	will be posting an updated version later today.<br>
	<br>
	Also a reminder that the November event Ashes and Dust will be going live 
	this upcoming Wednesday the 16th.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That’s it for now. Everyone have a good day.<br>

	Lupus Argenteus </a>)</p>
	<p>Well, we asked for feedback, and we certainly received it, with opinions 
	ranging all over the spectrum. To an extent, this was expected. To address a 
	few points:<br>
	<br>
	1.Why don't you use a 1 day/no timer? <br>
	<br>
	We would like template selections to mean something. We encourage you to 
	make new characters when you want to try a new template, rather than 
	respeccing each time. The ability to retrain is there, but we do not wish to 
	completely trivialize it.<br>
	<br>
	2.Why don't you leave the timers at 2 weeks?<br>
	<br>
	There is a significant part of the population who has been asking for some 
	change. We are attempting to implement something which will allow templates 
	broken by past games systems changes to be mended, while still assigning a 
	level of importance to early choices.<br>
	<br>
	3.Why don't you implement a cool-down timer?<br>
	<br>
	We believe that currently players are familiar enough with the current game 
	mechanics to be able to decide what sort of character they wish to play. In 
	the past, when we have made major changes to games systems (such as the 
	implementation of the Salvaging skill) we have given characters free 
	untrains of the skills affected - this is something we will continue to 
	consider when we make major gameplay changes. Between those two points, we 
	believe that there is no need for a cool-down timer on retrains.<br>
	<br>
	4.Why does it affect other players what I play?<br>
	<br>
	We must balance the gameplay of Asheron's Call against the entire community 
	of characters. In this sense, yes, what one player's choices are for their 
	character affects the game and the players around them. <br>
	<br>
	We have taken several of the comments into consideration. Here is the 
	revised retrain proposal:<br>
	<br>
	Untrain<br>
	1st-4th gems: Instant<br>
	5th-8th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	9th-16th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	17th and above: 3 week timer<br>
	<br>
	Specialization<br>
	1st-2nd gems: Instant<br>
	3rd-4th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	5th-8th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	9th and above: 3 week timer<br>

	<p>Hi there everyone. I hoe we are all having a good day. Let's get right to 
	our update today.<br>
	<br>
	A reminder that tomorrow is update day! That means all worlds will be down 
	from 9am to 2pm EST in order for us to bring the November event Ashes and 
	Dust live. Normally I would have these times up on the launcher and on the 
	State of the Network page already, but I am having some difficulty updating 
	the website today. We are looking into why I am having trouble, and 
	hopefully we can have this resolved by tomorrow.<br>
	<br>
	If this trouble continues into tomorrow then I will be posting the Rollout 
	Article and the Dev Notes here on the forums until we can get the troubles 
	fixed.<br>
	<br>
	Please remind those in your allegiance about the downtime tomorrow in case 
	we are not able to get the message up on the launcher.<br>
	<br>
	That's it for today. Everyone have a good night and see you all in Dereth!<br>
