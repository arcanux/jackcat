	<br>
	Hello there and welcome to the November 27th edition of the weekly update. I 
	hope everyone had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on things for the December event. They are 
	working out all of the details of the quests, working on some balance stuff 
	and overall just getting things ready for testing. <br>
	<br>
	We would now like to take this opportunity to answer a couple questions from 
	the forums over the last week. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Any chance that the Nuhmudira quest will be repeatable? </b><br>
	As of right now we have no plans to change how this quest works. If we do 
	decide to change anything on this quest we will be sure to let everyone 
	know. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Where is the non Subscriber section of the forums you promised a while 
	back?<br>
	</b>The reason is that right now we are having some issues making the 
	changes needed to our forum management system to allow it to recognize the 
	difference between the two user groups. It is something we are still working 
	on, but as of right now I do not have an ETA on when things will be ready.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Is there any chance we can get a mana check command?</b><br>
	As of right now this is not something in the plans, but I can bring it up to 
	the team.<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for today. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	We recently ran some tracking numbers on rares and drops and they are right 
	in line with where we wanted them to be. Remember, just because someone does 
	not go to a forum somewhere to announce they found a rare does not mean it 
	hasn't been found.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" alt="" src="remembering/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	There have a been a few high tier rares found that as far as I can tell have 
	not been reported to us or through any other programs. <br>
	<br>
	As far as the gallery goes, until the website gets redone I don't want to 
	put in a ton of work on something that will disappear soon after. To that 
	end, a member of the team has suggested an ingame form of the gallery. The 
	premise is you report what rare you found to us. If you are the first one to 
	report it, you name gets put on that rare and it gets displayed in museum 
	type place in the game. <br>
	<br>
	Of course this is just an idea and not anywhere near being set in stone at 
	this point.<br>

	<br>
	In another post I did actually say that the gallery was scrapped for now, 
	but we have some other ideas for displaying the rares that have been found. 
	I would also like to note that while this is not set in stone yet, we are 
	considering making some changes to the drop rate of rares. In particular we 
	may consider upping the drop rate a little so some of the less common rares 
	have a better chance of being found. Again, nothing is set in stone right 
	now. Currently we are just in the stage of having internal discussions about 
	rares and the drop rates. <br>
	<br>
	When we have more information on what we may be thinking of doing, we will 
	post it here for discussion.<br>

	We've got no plans to give full quest write-ups in any quest 
	finder/tracker/tool we do. Also, there's been internal discussion about not 
	putting in quests until the month following their introduction, in order to 
	give players the initial first rush of discovering new content.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, we are still in the very early stages of discussion on this,

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello there and welcome to the December 4th edition of 
	the weekly update! I hope everyone had a great weekend of AC playing and 
	relaxation. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on getting things prepared for the December 
	event. This includes testing for any final issues as well as making sure 
	that things are in line with where the team wanted them to be. The event is 
	set to go live on Tuesday December 19th and is titled Cold Tracks. <br>
	<br>
	We are very proud to say that the Asheron’s Call free trial has been a great 
	success thus far. Seeing not only new players but those returning to find 
	out what is new, is something we are very excited to see. One thing that has 
	stood out to me so far is all of the comments we have received from the new 
	and returning folks about how nice everyone has been to them. Helping 
	players get acquainted or re-acquainted with the game. Once again the 
	Asheron’s Call community proves why it is still one of the best gaming 
	communities in all of online gaming. Thank you all from us here on the team 
	as well as all of the people new or returning to the world of Dereth. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. I will have teaser images out to all of the 
	Fansites this week so make sure to stay tuned for those. Have a great week 
	and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	<p>I'm not convinced that the barkeep/rumor system works for everybody, 
	though. It worked for you, and for many people on the boards. However, I've 
	also heard anecdotally of stories of people who start to play our game, but 
	have no idea what to do once they emerge from the training academy, even 
	though there are pointers to the various quest NPCs for the first town.<br>
	<br>
	I'd be inclinced to say that rumors should probably get updated, too - after 
	all, usage of the quest list should be an optional tool. If we implement 
	tracking functionaliaty, I'd love to see about a toggleable setting that 
	switches between displaying all quests and only displaying those quests 
	which you are running/have run recently. That way, we give the power of 
	choice to the player to decide how much information they want to see.<br>
	<br>
	I think what makes this discussion seem less conservative is that normally 
	we don't come on here and talk about things like this before we hammer out 
	details. Right now, this system is still in the discussion phase, which 
	means we can change how we want to work it. Perhaps we'll decide to 
	incorporate barkeeps into the system in some way, or perhaps they'll remain 
	as a separate system - we don't know yet, and that's important to remember.</p>

	<p>Just wanted to step in here and second some of the other voices who have 
	spoken up about how this is a nice, civil, productive thread. I love this 
	thread. We may not do everything in this thread and we may choose different 
	directions than some of the opinions expressed in this thread (and at this 
	point I think we've enough opinions in here that, no mstter what, we'll end 
	up going in a different direction than some of them), but that's not simly a 
	dismissal of the opinions expressed. We're reading this thread, letting 
	things expressed here sink in, see if we agree or disagree, and such.<br>
	<br>
	I will say this much - I think that this thread has influenced some feeling 
	internally that not 100% of all quests should be visible on any list. One 
	idea we've been bouncing around is the idea of an Explorer set of quests, 
	which aren't listed but must instead be discovered. As part of this, we 
	could tailor them specifically for the sort of mindset who appreciates 
	striking out into the wilderness and finding the random buildings that no 
	one has seen before.<br>
	<br>
	When I have a longer moment, I'll address some of the other points raised 
	all through this thread. Just thought I'd come in and give this thread some 
	props.</p>

	<br>
	All characters, no matter the level, who are eligable for rares, have 
	exactly the same shot at finding a RTR when their timers is up. Timers for 
	all rare eligable characters are the same up to two month period.<br>
	<br>
	In some cases you may have to log in a mule that has not been played and 
	kill a rare eligable monster to set yourself up with the timer for the first 
	time.<br>
	<br>
	When the RTR system launched the frameworks had been in for over two months, 
	so players who had been around when the timer was last active in live were 
	already eligable for their first RTR. In the case of new characters and 
	characters who were not around durring that time period they would not be 
	eligable for a rare until they have logged on, killed something rare 
	eligable, then waited for their up to 2 months from that date RTR timer to 
	expire.<br>
	<br>
	Lower level characters have exactly the same chances of finding RTRs as any 
	other character as they do have exactly the same chances of finding a normal 
	rares. As always, rares are equally available to characters of all levels.</p>

	Due to some scheduling conflicts, patch day is going to be on the 19th 
	instead of the 12th. I have already made the change to my initial 
	announcement. <br>
	<br>
	Basically there is a whole bunch of things going on next week that could 
	potentially cause some problems, and conflict with our update. We decided it 
	was best to push things off for a week to ensure that everything went as 
	smooth as possible. Not to mention that since the November event came out 
	later than normal, it has not yet been a full month between updates.<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello and welcome to the late because I am sick 
	edition of the Weekly Update for the week of December 11, 2006! Based on 
	some recent feedback I am going to try a slightly different format for this 
	particular update.<br>
	<br>
	So this week I want to give you all some insight as to what we have been 
	discussing over the last few weeks in various meetings we have had. This 
	will be done of course, without going into too much detail. We don’t want to 
	give away everything in one little post, now do we?<br>
	<br>
	So, one thing that has been coming up a lot in our discussions recently has 
	been an Elder Game System. Everyone here is in total agreement this is some 
	type of Elder game needs to be done as soon as we can. One idea was to make 
	the system in some way tie in with allegiances and making them have an 
	important role in how this system works. As always, we will discuss things 
	more as we get closer to actually doing the work on this. The feedback we 
	get from the players will be a valuable tool we plan to use as much as 
	possible in designing something that is fun for everyone involved. I want to 
	be very clear that this subject is still in the very, very early stages of 
	discussion. <br>
	<br>
	We have also seen that a lot of folks were big fans of the Comic Style 
	teaser that was released for the Reign of Terror event. Right now art time 
	is a bit tight, but we are trying to find a way to possibly get something 
	like this done for the next big story arc. Along the lines of art we are 
	also in the process of trying to get some new art assets for the web. To be 
	used in things like online ads, and possibly a new website template or two. 
	If we do decide to go with the comic book teaser, I will let everyone know 
	ahead of time. Possibly with a teaser of the teaser! <br>
	<br>
	On a side note I have been very glad to see that the art of debating an 
	issue without insulting people is not dead. Case in point is this thread. 
	Who said the art of civil debate was dead? </span>
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Wink" alt="" src="remembering/wink.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><span lang="en-us"><br>
	<br>
	Well that’s about it for this week. Please remember all things discussed in 
	this update are by no means set in stone and plans could change at any time 
	based on our work load and direction. <br>
	<br>
	Have a great week and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	This is a &quot;They're undead, not ruschk, in Derethian terms, and if we left 
	them as the wrong creature type then we're going to fix it&quot; situation. It is 
	a bug if they are creature-type ruschk. Unfortunately, we don't bitmask 
	creature-types, so a creature has to be either undead or ruschk. Out of the 
	two, these guys lean far more toward the undead side than the ruschk side, 
	so that's what we wanted to have them be.</span></p>

	The newest portion of the Mi Krau Li's jitte is intended for characters 
	around the level of 60. This is one of, what we see as, the iconic quest 
	weapons of Asheron's Call (mostly upgradable quest items that have been 
	around for quite some time, and generally one for each attack type). Due to 
	this we may very well be upgrading it again in the future for higher level 
	ranges.</span></p>

	<br>
	Hello there and welcome to the Holiday edition of the Weekly update for 
	December 18, 2006.<br>
	<br>
	We were really happy to see all of the feedback from last weeks update. The 
	discussion has been handled very well so far and there has been several 
	great ideas given to us thus far. These kinds of discussions are exactly 
	what we are looking for when it comes to getting feedback from the players. 
	We are all very excited about the possibilities we have going forward. <br>
	<br>
	There will not be a weekly update next week. While the team will be keeping 
	an eye on things, I will be taking a little vacation over the holidays to 
	spend some time with family and friends. I will be checking in from time to 
	time, but for the most part these forums will be checked by the team and 
	some of the other OCR folks here at Turbine, such as Ramen and Saffron. 
	Please be nice to them if they do stop by. </span>

	As most of you know by now, this Tuesday December 19th is patch day. Please 
	remember that all worlds will be down from 8am EST – 3pm EST. <br>
	<br>
	In keeping with the theme of letting everyone in on what is going on in the 
	world of Asheron’s Call, I wanted to give everyone a peek into what is 
	coming soon to Asheron’s Call. Coming in the month of January we are 
	planning on running some scheduled live ops to further progress the 
	storyline we are currently in right now. We will be posting a schedule for 
	these ops when we get closer to the time they are going live. We are going 
	to look at several factors in determining when the best times to run these 
	and future events will be. Our goal is to get as many players as we can 
	involved in these events. <br>
	<br>
	I must admit that being a part of these events is one of the best perks of 
	working on Asheron’s Call. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Everyone have a happy and safe holiday 
	season, and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	Searching for that special holiday gift? Is there an allegiance member or 
	friend that you want to help out in a time of financial need? Give the gift 
	of game time! <br>
	<br>
	The Turbine Account Management Team has had numerous inquiries regarding the 
	proper way to pay for a friend’s account. Here’s how to pay for your 
	friend's game subscription the Turbine way!<br>
	<br>
	The account management team will be happy to assist you with what we call a 
	OTP (One-Time-Payment). This will allow you to pay for a family member, 
	friend, or allegiance member’s game subscription without changing the 
	ownership of the account. To make a OTP all you will need is to follow the 
	instructions given in the link below. When you give us a call a 
	representative will locate the account and you can pay for any amount of 
	time you would like! It’s that simple. At your request, our representatives 
	will also send a personalized email to your buddy letting them know about 
	your gift. <br>
	<br>
	Please see the following article for more information:

	*Please note: Paying for another players account by any other means then the 
	above method could be a violation of the Terms of Service.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you and Happy Holidays-<br>
