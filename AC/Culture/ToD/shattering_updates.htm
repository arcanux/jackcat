	Hello there everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend.<br>
	<br>
	This week we are busy getting everything ready for the Penny Arcade Expo, 
	which begins this upcoming Friday. For those of you who will be attending 
	the event, I wanted to let you know what will be going on. Aside from being 
	able to play a little AC at the event, people will also be able to win all 
	sorts of prize goodness from the many different contests we will have going. 
	We are also going to be having a bit of a party at the Red Lion Hotel on 
	Saturday night. At the party, which is being sponsored by Nvidia, we will be 
	giving away 3 Nvidia 7800 GTX video cards, along with other prizes. That is 
	on top of the drinks, giveaways, trivia, and more. It should be a great 
	night for everyone in attendance. On a personal note I am really looking 
	forward to meeting those of you who are able to make it. <br>
	<br>
	As a result of my being at PAX this year, next weeks update will be late. I 
	will be taking a redeye home on Monday night, so Tuesday is slated for me to 
	sleep a bit. I will of course have a full report and pictures from all the 
	events when I do finally get out of bed. <br>
	<br>
	The team is continuing to work on things for the September event, and things 
	are shaping up nicely so far. This is also the time of year when we begin 
	thinking of the festival season. This is personally one of my favorite 
	things in Asheron’s Call, when the leaves change colors and the costumes 
	come out.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" alt="" src="shattering/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. We will have updates from PAX as often as time 
	allows for posting so make sure to keep checking in for those updates.<br>
	<br>
	Have a great week and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	<p>I would like to thank everyone who was able to make it to PAX and to the 
	dinner that was held on Sunday night. I had a great time and got to meet 
	alot of great current and hopefully future players.

	<br>
	Alot of the stuff I mentioned there was in concept. The Texas Hold em type 
	game is my little pet project I would like to see in the game, but it is far 
	from done. The pets I was showing off were also still very much concept 
	pets. There is a very fine line that we do not want to cross with 
	interactive pets. If we step too far over that line, game balance will be 
	messed up bad. We are going to take things slowly and try to do things right 
	the first time. We would much rather take our time with this then rush into 
	things.<br>
	<br>
	I will have more on other things that were mentioned over the weekend 
	tomorrow when I get the weekly update out.<br>

	<p>I know it is already Thursday, but better late than never. <br>
	<br>
	First off PAX was a great time for everyone. It was great to get a chance to 
	meet alot of present and former Asheron’s Call players, as well as hopefully 
	some new ones. This was my first game related show, and it was definitely 
	not my last. Getting the chance to talk to that many people about the game 
	we all love was something I had been looking forward to for a long time. <br>
	<br>
	So let’s get on with how things went. We had two stations set up so people 
	could either log into some pre- created characters, or they could log into 
	their own accounts if they wanted to, since these stations were connected to 
	the live worlds. During the show there was almost never a time when these 
	stations were not being used by someone, which of course meant that I never 
	got to eat lunch during the two days the show floor was open. <br>
	<br>
	On Sunday after the show was over, I had the chance to sit down with about 
	30 or so people at the Seattle area AC Dinner. This was truly fun for me, 
	though I was a bit nervous. There is no tougher crowd than a room full of AC 
	players. This is where I started to loose my voice finally after 3 days of 
	talking to everyone who would listen to me about how great Asheron’s Call 
	is. While at the dinner I pretty much gave away everything that wasn’t 
	nailed down. Including shirts and some signed game boxes as well as a nice 
	little silver Lugian I found hanging out in the office. Everyone there made 
	sure he went to a good home. <br>
	<br>
	Alot of people have asked me to confirm what was said at the show and over 
	the weekend so I will no try to remember everything that was said.<br>
	<br>
	Of course the big feature of the weekend was the Pets demo that I was 
	showing off. The two particular pets being shown were the healing Penguin 
	and the dispelling Olthoi. Both of these pets were in there just to show 
	some of the things we might be able to do going forward with this new 
	ability. Right now the pets just cast randomly, but we are working on trying 
	to get things more controlled. We also announced the four pets that will be 
	available upon release: Drudge, Armoredillo, Thrungus, and of course the 
	Ursuin. Players will be able to own all 4 pets but they will only be able to 
	have one out at a time. These little pets will be non- combat, and they will 
	in no way be able to block doorways or other entrances. For now they will be 
	cute and cuddly companions for everyone to have if they so choose. But who 
	knows what else we might be able to do with them going forward. <br>
	<br>
	We also discussed something that can sometimes be a sensitive subject around 
	here, advertising. We announced that the premier issue of a new MMO 
	magazine, Massive Magazine, will feature Asheron’s Call on the back cover 
	with a special offer for new or returning players. We also announced that 
	the online ads will also be appearing soon to help continue to drive up the 
	population of Asheron’s Call, which has been steadily rising for the last 
	several months now. All of us here are very excited about what the future 
	has in store for Asheron’s Call. <br>
	<br>
	There were a couple of other smaller things I let out there, but I figured I 
	would save those for next week’s update since this one is coming out so 
	late. <br>
	<br>
	We will hopefully have some pictures of all the fun posted as soon as I sort 
	though all the photos that we took. All in all it was a great weekend for 
	everyone involved. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now, everyone have a great weekend and for those of you 
	in the US enjoy the long holiday weekend. I know I will.<br>
	<br>
	See you all in Dereth!<br>

	<p>Hello there everyone I hope you all had a great weekend. It was a nice 
	long weekend for most of us here, so we are all well rested.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" alt="" src="shattering/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	This week we are in the final stages of testing for the September event, 
	Come What Follows, which is scheduled to go live on Tuesday September 12th. 
	We are looking forward to getting everyone’s reactions to some of the new 
	features going into the game this month. <br>
	<br>
	One of the key things going in for the September event is Uninscription 
	Stones. For a fee players will be able to purchase these stones, which when 
	used on an item with an inscription, will clear that inscription off of that 
	item. These stones will only work with loot items. If you have a quest item 
	that was inscribed by another player, the stone will not be able to remove 
	the inscription. The stone also does not work on unique game inscribed items 
	such as Pack Cows and Ulgrim’s Gromnies. This is another item we thought was 
	previously not possible. Once again the team has gone above and beyond in 
	order to make things work that were previously thought impossible.<br>
	<br>
	We will also be revisiting a couple of older quest items that could use some 
	attention. I won’t say which ones, but we think alot of people will be happy 
	to see these particular items getting some love. <br>
	<br>
	I also wanted to take this opportunity to explain the mix up with some live 
	events this weekend. Basically for some strange reason the person who was 
	going to set off the events found himself unable to create the things needed 
	to start the events. We are still trying to figure out why the permissions 
	he needed were not there for him. As far as we can tell it was just a mix up 
	on what game accounts should be allowed to do what. We apologize to those 
	who saw the global announcements only to find no event. <br>
	<br>
	Before I forget to ask… In the next couple of months we are going to have 
	the opportunity to go back and do some “clean up” on some older quests, but 
	we need your help. If everyone could give us their top 10 quests they would 
	like to see us go back over, we will take all of the feedback and go check 
	those quests out again. So feel free to reply here with your top 10 quests 
	you would like to see us revisit. We can’t promise that every quest that 
	players list here will be redone, but we want to make sure that we are 
	hitting places that you the players want us to.<br>
	<br>
	One last note and this is to make sure everyone is paying attention. :P On 
	this upcoming Thursday September 7th, you may want to make sure you are in 
	game between the hours of 7pm EDT- 10pm EDT. I suspect it will be an 
	interesting night for everyone involved. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	<p>As you all know today is the 5th anniversary of a horrible day. Every 
	year since that day I have spent this day with family and friends, some of 
	who were/are Fire Fighters. This keeps me out of the office for most of the 
	day, which makes it tough to get an update together. <br>
	<br>
	I will have an update posted tomorrow along with the Developer's Notes and 
	Rollout Fiction. It will be a busy day for everyone.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" alt="" src="shattering/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	Just as a reminder tomorrow September 12, all worlds will be down from 8am 
	EDT - 3pm EDT for the September event, <b><i>Come What Follows</i></b>. <br>
	<br>
	Last but not least, on this day of mourning and remembrance please take the 
	time to let those close to you know just how much they mean to you. It may 
	not seem like much, but sometimes we take for granted being able to say we 
	care to those closest to us.<br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a good day.<br>
