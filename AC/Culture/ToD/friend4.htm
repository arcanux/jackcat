	- Sept. 5, 2005<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font size="2"><br>
	It was a calm day on the island of Marae Lassel. The sky was blue and 
	everything pointed to it being another beautiful day in Dereth. But this was 
	not going to be an ordinary day, as we would soon find out. The sentries 
	that patrol the many towns are used to running into danger, but they are 
	also used to long periods of time where they see nothing unusual. So when 
	one of them spotted what looked like a small army outside of Greenspire let 
	by a Scout Commander, he was surprised but prepared. The sentry quickly went 
	to sound the call for all warriors to come, but as he did there was a 
	sinking feeling in his gut. It was no secret that King Varicci II wanted to 
	expand his lands, but to be so bold as to approach one of the Queen's towns? 
	He wouldn't dare, would he? <br>
	<br>
	The sentry quickly ran to sound the alarm, but he was spotted by the 
	approaching enemy and he knew that there was not much time to warn the town 
	of the impending assault. The only warning the town would have of the 
	approaching danger was that alarm and the sentry knew he had to get the 
	warning out as fast as he could, no matter the cost. Before he reached the 
	alarm, the Viamontian Scout Commander quickly sent his brave soul to the 
	lifestone. <br>
	<br>
	The Sentry recovered as quickly as he could at the nearby lifestone and made 
	his way to the alarm. Even as he sounded the call he felt another stabbing 
	pain. He looked down to a Viamontian axe buried deep in his side. Even 
	through all of the pain, his only thought was the fear that he would be too 
	late to save anyone. <br>
	<br>
	The call finally went out in the early afternoon, a call that had not 
	sounded in quite some time. In fact, it had been so long since the call to 
	arms had been sounded that many were either not prepared or in disbelief 
	when they heard it. The shock quickly wore off as the brave warriors of 
	Dereth gathered up their armor and weapons and headed to the small town of 
	Greenspire, not knowing what was in store for them as they rushed into 
	battle. What foe had decided to once again try to take on the people of 
	Dereth? <br>
	<br>
	When the first warrior stepped out of portal space, he could not believe 
	what he saw. He barely had time to think about it as he was quickly struck 
	down by one of the many Viamontian Knights waiting there. Soon the warriors 
	of Dereth were arriving from all directions and the Viamontian Scout 
	Commander quickly realized this was not going to be a victorious day for his 
	King. <br>
	<br>
	Many of Dereth's finest warriors rushed into battle to stop this group of 
	Viamontian's before they advanced into the town. It was a long and bloody 
	battle that seemed to last forever. Just as it seemed that all hope was 
	lost, the people of Dereth stood strong in the face of danger. In the end, 
	the brave people of Dereth once again stopped the onslaught of an outside 
	force threatening their lands. Is this the last we will see of these 
	Viamontian scouting parties? Why are they here? What are their intentions?

	stampeded their way through Ayan Baqur last night. What started out as 
	laughter soon turned into screams of terror when the players realized these 
	cute little creatures meant business. <br>
	<br>
	Below is an excerpt from the chat log that were collected during this raid.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Endar Zael says, &quot;aww those little golems are so cute!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Small Golem says, &quot;Blood!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Realm of Darkness says, &quot;save me&quot;<br>

	Small Golem says, &quot;Blood!&quot;<br>

	Scathe says, &quot;DONT MOVE, YOU GOT ONE RIGHT ON YOUR SHOULDER&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Small Golem says, &quot;Blood!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Scathe says, &quot;DIE<br>
	<br>
	Small Golem says, &quot;Bloo-ACK!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	General Heredia says, &quot;that was hilarious&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Realm of Darkness says, &quot;lmao&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Realm of Darkness says, &quot;debuffing&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Realm of Darkness says, &quot;a tiny golem&quot;</i><br>
	<br>
	What started off as a group of Tiny Golems soon turned into an all out Golem 
	war!<br>
	<br>
	<i>Lodwicke says, &quot;MORE&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lodwicke says, &quot;ATTACK&quot;<br>
	<br>
	General Heredia says, &quot;AHHHHHH&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lodwicke says, &quot;hold the line&quot;</i><br>
	<br>
	The thunder of Small Magma Golem crushing Slims new guy is followed by the 
	deafening silence of death!<br>
	<br>
	Lodwicke suffers a frozen fate at the hands of Sapphire Golem!<br>
	<br>
	The thunder of Sapphire Golem crushing Big bug is followed by the deafening 
	silence of death!<br>
	<br>
	<i>Big bug says, &quot;got hit for 400+&quot;</i><br>
	<br>
	The Sapphire Golems were quickly dispatched however that was not the end of 
	it. <br>
	<br>
	Tiereal's body is shattered by Crystal Golem Imperator's attack!<br>
	<br>
	<i>Endar Zael says, &quot;respawn&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Arcainis says, &quot;holy smokes&quot;<br>
	</i><br>
	After calling for reinforcements the Defenders of Ayan were able to destroy 
	the Crystal Golem Imperator and saved the day!<br>
	<br>
	I believe Endar Zael said it best.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Endar Zael says, &quot;the bigger they are the harder they fall!&quot;</i><br>

        <p align="left">Without warning, the sewers in the meeting halls have 
		been backing up recently. This has been forcing the many creatures that 
		dwell in them to come out into the halls. What began as a rat or two has 
		become a full blown problem. The local sentries are in need of your help 
		in keeping the halls clear of these creatures and safe for all to use.
		<br>
		<br>
		The first time this happened, the brave &quot;Fit to Fight&quot; came in and 
		helped clear out this problem. He was rewarded with Dereth's first ever 
		title of &quot;Sanitation Engineer&quot;. He was also rewarded with a few items of 
		appreciation and of course, the Queen's gratitude. <br>
		<br>
		The cause of this problem has yet to be determined, but know that we are 
		currently investigating why this is happening and what we can do to stop 
		the creatures from coming into our meeting halls. <br>
		<br>
		We ask that all residents of Dereth please keep a watchful eye on the 
		many meeting halls in the towns to make sure they stay clear for all to 
		use and enjoy. <br>

	Players where surprised today to discover a small colony of penguins near 
	the Ayan Baqur lifestone. These innocent creatures surely must have lost 
	there way and somehow ended up in this desert town. <br>
	<br>
	Exhausted and dehydrated the colony of penguins wandered unknowingly into 
	Ayan. Local players were baffled by the arrival of penguins. What would 
	these creatures be doing all the way out here? Players pondered this notion 
	for a moment and then quickly dispatched the tiny birds. <br>
	<br>
	Some where sad to see them die while others thought it best to put them &quot;out 
	of their misery&quot;, and there were even a select few who laughed about killing 
	these creatures. <br>
	<br>
	Never fear dear reader for their deaths did not go unnoticed. <br>
	<br>
	No sooner did the last bird die when another larger colony of UBER Penguins 
	appeared over the horizon. The battle that followed was by far one of the 
	most intense Ayan as seen in years. Who would have thought penguins could be 
	so... Uber!?<br>

		Darktide players have been given a rare treat indeed. They finally get 
		to do something they have wanted to do for YEARS!<br>
		<br>
		Yes folk's players on Darktide will now be able to PK a member of the 
		Turbine Live Event Staff. At random times a member of the Live Event 
		Staff will log in and engage these fearsome PK players in battle. Who 
		will win? Who will rule the day? Who will reign supreme!? Only time will

		So with that said I leave you with these simple words &quot;Kill me if you

		Last night, players on Frostfell were given an opportunity to request 
		creature spawns. There was much shouting for &quot;BZ&quot; however once they 
		realized that he was not a realistic request they settled on others. 
		Soon things were in full swing as players cried out for all sorts of 
		things. <br>

	T</span>he brave warriors of Frostfell were met with an unexpected event 
	Thursday evening. Unpredictable voltaic energies erupted from the mountains 
	surrounding the ruins of the Essence of Artifice. As adventurers rushed to 
	investigate, they were met with a legion of Lightning Elementals, Diamond 
	Golem Suzerains, Avalanches and Blizzards. What caused this sudden welling 
	of energy? A massive chunk of Crystalized Galvanic Mana, crackling with 
	energy, was summoning powerful elemental minions. As adventurers rush in to 
	cap the flow of energy, a being the likes of which have never been seen 
	before in Dereth sparked to life before their very eyes – the Galvanic 
	Knight!<br>
