    <font size="2"><b><a name="1"></a>Live Op Announcement and Schedule</b></font><font size="2" face="arial"><br>
	In the June Event, &quot;From the Darkest Depths&quot;, we will be conducting a series 
	of Live Ops which will affect the fate of each individual world of Asheron's 
	Call. Since the Live Ops are radically different from previous Live Ops, and 
	since there are worldwide consequences for success or failure, we are giving 
	you some information about the structure of the Live Ops in advance so that 
	you may prepare and plan your strategy with other members of your faction.<br>
	<br>
	The Live Ops concern the conflict between the Whispering Blade and the Rossu 
	Morta. Both the Black Knight and Count Dardante are aware of several 
	crystals unearthed by the tumultuous awakening of Grael. Both sides are 
	unaware of the exact dungeon in which these crystals are located, however, 
	and are sending out scouts to find the crystal and take it for their own 
	side.<br>
	<br>
	There are some requirements to fully participate in these Live Ops. One must 
	be a full Player Killer (not a Player Killer Lite) in order to enter the 
	dungeon where the crystal is housed. One must also be a member of either the 
	Rossu Morta or the Whispering Blade to return the crystal to the appropriate 
	faction. If you are not both of these things, you will not be able to 
	directly affect the outcome of the Live Op (although you may be able to help 
	- see below).<br>
	<br>
	For your convenience, PK altars are now present in both Chapter Houses, and 
	will remain as permanent fixtures to more easily facilitate conflict between 
	either group. If you want to fully participate as a PK, you may also want to 
	ensure that you have equipped yourself appropriately for the conflict, 
	remembering that during PK, items may be looted from your corpse by your 
	killer. Bonded items are therefore especially valuable during PK, as is 
	possessing sufficient high-valued items to prevent yourself from dropping 
	your own armor and weapons in case of death. You may also wish to 
	familiarize yourself to the myriad changes that were made to Asheron's Call 
	in March of this year, if you have not participated in PK in a while.<br>
	<br>
	If you have aversions to participating as a PK, or have not officially 
	joined a faction, fear not - there are ways in which you may still 
	participate in the Live Op. Any character may choose to help search the 
	landscape, notifying your chosen faction if you happen to find a portal that 
	has changed to only allow PKs so that the attack group from your faction can 
	enter it to capture the crystal inside. Members of the Rossu Morta or 
	Whispering Blade also remain with either the Black Knight or Count Dardante, 
	in hopes that they will be able to volunteer further information that you 
	may disseminate to your faction.<br>
	People may also express some concern as to the schedule of events. For the 
	format we have chosen to use and the amount of manpower needed to run this 
	Live Op, it makes the most sense to only run a single occurrence of the Live 
	Op per world. Therefore, we are trying to schedule to accommodate the 
	location of the majority of our player base. </font><strike><font size="2">We believe that the 7 PM start 
	time will allow the greatest number of players to participate in the Live Op 
	for this one-time only event.</font></strike><font size="2" face="arial"> <b>
	We have rescheduled the event to occur at 8pm due to player feedback.</b><br>
	<br>
	Finally, please be aware that, with this Live Op, we are introducing a 
	limited amount of server divergence - depending on the performance of both 
	factions, either the Rossu Morta or Whispering Blade will receive a small 
	advantage on that server. Therefore, if you are or plan to be a member of 
	either faction, it is in your best interest to participate in some manner in 
	this Live Op. We encourage you to participate in determining the history of 
	your world!<br>

	Maggie, Just wanna let you know that Grael's shadow forces have attacked 
	some of the towns. I'm guessing that they are the Original Shadow Spire 
	towns. The baddies are all 100+ shades led by Grael's Shadow Leiutenant who 
	drops part of a ripped note. Also there are seemingly random portal spawns 
	by the craters. The notes can't be used on each other so I'm guessing 
	they're for use in where ever the portals take you.&quot;</p>

	Design dungeon (ToD needed) at 93.6N, 44.6W. <br>
	<br>
	At each of these areas/towns there are tons of mid to higher level shadows. 
	You will need to look for the Grael's Lieutenant Shadow (boss monster). Kill 
	him and loot his corpse. Each Grael Lieutenant in each of the 7 areas 
	mentioned above will drop a piece of a broken letter. There will be 7 pieces 
	in total. <br>
	<br>
	Combine all these 7 pieces (they only go together one way) to make an 
	Untranslated Letter. Take this to Cragstone to Bretself the Translator just 
	outside of Cragstone. Then take the translated letter finally to Wei Jhou 
	and take it to Sarkin Killcane and he will give you a title (Apprentice 
	Shadow Hunter) and a measily 2.4 million xp.<br>

	Hiya Maggie! <br>
	Scotty the Handy Man of LC here. You probably have and will receive more 
	intricate names and globals, but this is the basis of this quest.<br>
	<br>
	A global went up around 6ish, telling us to go to Bandit Castle. There we 
	met an NPC who directed us to a portal 5 clicks away that portalled us to 
	some island with a falatacot temple and tons of tendrils. On this temple 
	were North, West, and East Dungeons, with the Everlasting Slumber port on 
	the top. <br>
	<br>
	First, we were required to enter East, which was filled with Debuff All 
	traps at every ramp, and was, in itself, a giant maze. After taking all 
	lefts, one could reach the bottom. I think Zyz got there first. Once more 
	people arrived, we killed the Queen presider by the Eastern Vault door. She 
	dropped a key, which opened the vault door and some rubble rock things (3 of 
	them spawning every 15 seconds). <br>
	<br>
	We give that to the new NPC in Bandit Castle and that flags us for the West 
	portal. This one was pretty straight-forward. Basically, you go north at the 
	4 way (at drop point) and go to a ledge to a pit. This ledge also had a 
	dispel all, so watch out. The majority of this dungeon was levers and 
	buttons to open doors. Again, it's pretty straight-forward. Just keep 
	pulling stuff and eventually you'll get through. On one of the last doors to 
	open with a lever is a pressure plate in the empty room to the South. You'll 
	know it when you're there. Going all the way through this dungeon led to 
	another Queen presider, whom also dropped a key to the Western Vault. Inside 
	were more rubble rock things. <br>
	<br>
	After portalling back to Bandit castle and giving it to NPC once more, we go 
	to the North. This one was all lefts, and the monsters are grouped in like 
	2-4's in most areas. Again, very straight forward, but LONG tunnels. At the 
	end, guarded by the monotonous Tendrils (those things were such a pain. 
	Remember to bring weedkiller) is the portal to the Everlasting Slumber. 
	Inside was a jump down into a dispel all ledge overlooking a pit of acid 
	with translucent side stepping floors like in BM3, with a big ass Soul 
	Crystal hovering above it. Accidentally falling down into the acid, we 
	discovered that it was all an illusion and there was an invisible floor 
	above it. Killing the crystal was another story. It probably took about 
	30-45 minutes, and it kept casting &quot;Galvanic&quot; strikes, discs, bolts, etc. 
	that you could not protect against. It also dispelled weapon buffs. <br>
	<br>
	Upon killing that, about 50 or so shards spawned all around the pit, and 
	bringing these shards to the guy in Bandit Castle gives xp (I'm guessing 
	about 10% of level) and the helm. Oh yeah, the helm. Empowered Helm of Isin 
	Dule (attached pic and stats) Zyz got the global on our server.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for updating the site. Hope you haven’t gotten your baby addicted to 
	this yet. Wait until the age of 2 before you unleash late-night quest 
	sessions!<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">**********</font></font><font face="arial" size="2"></font><p>Hi Maggie,<br>
	Here some info I hope you find usefull for the new Helm of Isin Dule quest 
	with my notes at the bottom.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Thank you for coming. I 
	feared many would not be willing to hear me out.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Grael has awakened. My lord tried to stop 
	this, but it has come to pass. I fear the Black Spear's rage will consume 
	this world, if he is not stopped. To that end, my Lord has sent me to aid 
	you and all those who go with you.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;First, a little lesson in history...&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Long ago, Grael, the Black Spear of the 
	Kemeroi, chose to sleep. The place he chose to sleep was an isle north of 
	here, north of Vissidal Isle. His presence covered the island in Shadow, and 
	the isle soon came to be called the Dark Isle.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Those Falatacot who followed the Old One, 
	N'cthail took a chance and used ancient seals to sink the isle below the 
	waves. It was their hope that none would ever wake Grael and that this world 
	would be free of him forever. Now, however, that wish has been undone by 
	another.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;I have been shown the path to this temple. If 
	the ancient stories are true, there should be a crystal in this temple to 
	which the ancient seals are bound. The temple is heavily defended. There are 
	wards that block the use of the portals to the catacombs. I've located a 
	tablet that will allow me to enchant you to bypass the Eastern Temple 
	Catacomb's wards. Go into the Temple. There is a portal to the Temple opened 
	at 70.4N, 50.5E. Find the entrance to the Eastern Catacombs, bring back 
	anything you find that may aid us further.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Kiriel Shadowborn Eastern Temple Tablet.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Ahh, this should 
	help...&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Nightborn examines the tablet, muttering over the runes while tracing 
	them with a finger. A cold darkness slowly covers the runes.<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Beautiful. Not everything I need to gain you 
	access to the crystal, but it points to the remainder of the information. 
	There is a second tablet in the Western Catacombs. It contains the rest of 
	the enchantment I need to gain you access to the crystal. Enter the Western 
	Catacombs, find the tablet hidden there.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Kiriel Shadowborn intones softly and a cold chill 
	passes over you for a moment.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;There, now you can enter 
	the Western Catacombs. Good luck.&quot;<br>
	</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;The second tablet. Now 
	we're getting somewhere&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Now, I'll be able to complete the enchantment 
	gaining you access to the Northern Catacombs. At the bottom of the Northern 
	Catacombs, you should find the gate to the crystal we seek. Find it. Destroy 
	it. Bring me proof of its demise, and I will reward you.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;There, now you can enter the Northern 
	Catacombs. Good luck, and take care. The path only gets more difficult from 
	here.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Have you done it? I can 
	feel the power flowing around you. If you have proof of the crystal's 
	demise, please, hand it to me so that I may reward you.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Kiriel Shadowborn Crystal Shard.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;A shard of the partially 
	reformed Soul Crystal...&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;It is good that this crystal not be allowed to 
	fully reform. There is a chance, if the Falatacot and the crystal were left 
	alone for long enough, that they could re-sink the Dark Isle, cutting us off 
	from the opportunity we sought in its raising.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Tell Please, accept this humble reward for 
	your continued efforts to keep the Dark Isle above the waves.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You've earned 46,949,665 experience. <br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn gives you Helm of Isin Dule.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;My Lord thanks you for 
	your aid. It should be some time before the crystal can fully reform. If you 
	were to return in about a month, I'd be happy to reward you with another 
	helm. Providing, of course, that you bring me proof of the reforming 
	crystal's demise.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	Crystal of the Dark Isle is level 275 and weak to bludgeoning. It drops 
	10-12 Cyrstal Shards on death if I am not mistaken. All elements do the same 
	damage except lightning, was getting 0's with lightning. You will want to 
	use imperil and fester as it took 7 of us a while (15 - 20 minutes) to kill. 
	In the last dungeon (Vault of Eternal Slumber) you will have a group of 
	plants with a dispel trap that is on a ledge. Below is a lot of acid but 
	there is an invisible platform above all of the acid so you will not have to 
	worry about jumping down. I would recommend just killing the plants and 
	walking to the edge and buff then jump down just because of the dispel. We 
	had one person die and he was able to run to the portal to the temple and 
	then take the &quot;shortcut&quot; portal that is on top of the temple to the Vault of 
	Eternal Slumber. The whole quest took us a couple of hours. The first 
	dungeon is a maze with dispell, have fun. The 2nd dungeon is more of a 
	puzzle but nothing hard to figure out. It also had dispels The third dungeon 
	didn't have any dispels and had a couple easy trigger system (levers and 
	buttons). And the last duongeon I mentioned above, was very small. There are 
	parts where it gets a little laggy with A HUGE amount of plants. Our fellow 
	consisted of Mages, Melees, and an archer. We used fire mainly and wall 
	spells of fire to take out the big groups of plants. <br>
	<br>
	Like I said above, I hope this info is useful and thanks for the webs site, 
	I've been enjoying it for years.<br>

	Xyrd, Vici, Jiggi-watt, Kuni Xao-ping, and I.)<br>
	<br>
	Many met about an hour before it started to get the feel of PK or just to 
	get to know each other. And…kill each other (The Black Knight even observed, 
	“The people are not working together and need to be disciplined or something 
	to that effect). When the Black Knight did show at 8, I had all my ports and 
	portal gems ready and at hand. It took him a while to “summon the magics and 
	gather information” but he finally said Khayyaban. So we all rushed over to 
	Khayyaban. With GoArrow at hand, I searched the 2 closest dungeons, to find 
	they were not PK only. Another person of my fellow did happen to find it and 
	we all ran to the coords for Winthura's Garden and entered. Through this, 
	people were chasing down each other and killing, no matter what side. <br>
	<br>
	I found that we greatly outnumbered the Rossu Morta, and there were so few, 
	WB vs. WB didn’t seem too out of the ordinary. Upon entering, we found the 
	crystal in a lame spot- in the very front of the dungeon. What was even 
	weirder was there were only like 8 people in there. Once the crystal 
	encasement died, I happened to click at the right time and got the dropped 
	shard. Wow! A crystal…oh yes, to the chapterhouse. I clambered for the 
	recall orb, though no one was there to kill me. I traded with the knight and 
	he thanked me. Then we waited another 5 minutes to get everyone together and 
	the Knight said Baishi. So we went there, and a fellow member finally found 
	that dungeon 2 was Trialos. Scrambling, we got there, and had a little more 
	people there- I’d say about 15. When it died, I surprisingly got the 2nd 
	dropped shard. Though this time, people were chasing me while I looked for 
	my recall orb. Giving the shard to the Knight, he only thanked me again. Man 
	of few words, man of few yards. (He was so small, many thought he was 
	Borolean as a child.). <br>
	<br>
	The third town was Stonehold, so I summoned a portal for my fellow, and we 
	all got there (I got there conjoined to my fellow and I had to relog). 
	Eventually, our fellow found the third dungeon, The Pit, and jumping the 
	very bottom was that last crystal. At the very last second, one of my fellow 
	jumped on me, blocking my view from getting that last crystal. BUT Vici, 
	another of our fellow did get it, despite even more people. After he gave 
	the last shard to the Knight, the Knight was like “Yay” and put the full 
	level VII life buff crystal in the corner. Then mass interspersed killings 
	ensued. Though I much more preferred a title, the Knight generously 
	inscribed my Silveran Sword for me, likewise to Vici’s Silveran Wand. Adso 
	came and threatened everyone and both Admins left, nothing more. (Full 
	inscription: In commemoration of your skill and bravery, for retrieving two 
	of the three crystals we sought. May your actions always bring honor to the 
	Whispering Blade.)<br>
	<br>
	Sadly, I did not die once that day. I got all bonded armor and weapons and 
	packs-worth of DIs and didn’t die once. Oh well, I felt it challenged my own 
	ego and wit, and was proud to have supported the Whispering Blade. I think 
	the Rossu Morta need more people and teamwork for next time.<br>
	<br>
	I’m sorry, I always forget to take pics in the most pivotal moments. I have 
	3 non-descript ones. How’s the baby? Did the first words pertain to 
	Asheron’s Call? ;)</p>

	<br>
	It is completed by doing the same thing as the apprentice shadow hunter 
	quest, but by killing captains that are now in the towns.<br>
	<br>
	You get a shadow mote from each of them and they combine to make a shadow 
	shard which turns in to the same NPC Wai Jhou that was needed for the 
	apprentice title. You keep the shard at the end though, so maybe something

	<p align="left">Sweet Little Sister of Knights Reborn, HG reports: &quot;Just as 
	we were about to go on Flutterbye's Bobo run, a global went out. Grael's 
	forces were attacking towns. Rithwic, Holtburg and Shoushi all showed clear, 
	so we guessed at the towns where the Shadow Lieutenants had been. Sure 
	enough, we started seeing messages about Arwic being full of Shadows. Not 
	just Shadows, but Nightmare Shadows, Shadow Wraiths, Shadow Phantoms, Lesser 
	Penumbral Horrors, Void Lords and two specials: Grael's Shadow Captain, 
	who's just another spellsword, and the Shadow Storms overhead. Shadow Storms 
	are black clouds with little bits of fire showing and they chain-cast Bolt 
	VII and Streak VII at people. They sometimes disappear for a while, but 
	can't be killed.<br>
	<br>
	The specific locations change, as the Captains stray further from the spire 
	craters than the Lieutenants did, but the rest of the mechanics are the 
	same. One-time-only pickup of a Shadow Mote from each Captain corpse, a 
	particular sequence in which they're fitted together and xp and a title 
	(Shadow Hunter) from that Killcrane bod in Wei Jhou. One difference is that 
	we still have the Shadow Shards we assembled. XP is level-related.&quot;<br>

	<p align="left">Flippy of LC reports on the forum: &quot;</font></font><font face="Arial">I 
	wanted to get the warning out if your not already aware. <br>
	<br>
	The towns of Eastham, Arwic, Sawato, Tufa, Tuo-Tuo, and Khayaban now have 
	been invaded with Shadows. The Shadows range in levels of 110 to 135, led by 
	a Level 161 Grael's Captain shadow (boss monster). I was actually logged in 
	with a mule on Friday night when it started. Two seconds after everything 
	spawned in, I was staring at my lifestone. I then brought on my level 192 
	battlemage, which was logged out in the middle of town, thinking this was 
	going to be like last Friday. 30 seconds later looking at my lifestone, I 
	made the realization, that umm no this was going to be a bit harder than 
	last Friday.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to all of the shadows in town, black clouds spawn on/off over 
	town and cast all 4 different elemental magics for damage on any target that 
	is close. So if you have low level mules logged off in the middle of those 
	towns, you might want to wait until the shadows go away before logging in.<br>
	<br>
	As far as running the quest, it is almost the same as the one that was 
	posted on patch page from last Friday 6/16. The difference is when you kill 
	the boss, you get a shadow mote that you connect with the other 6 from the 
	other shadow captains in the other town (plus the one out by the Dark Design 
	dungeon). After you have all the pieces put together, take it to the shadow 
	hunter in Wei Jhou. The Shadow hunter will give you about 9 million xp and 
	the title &quot;shadow hunter&quot;. He does not know what to do with all of the motes 
	in their finished form and tells you to hold onto them; there might be a use 
	in the future. </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial">
	This one is a bit more difficult to do than the last one. The one from last 
	Friday an allegiance member and myself ran the quest separately and neither 
	one of us died. This one we ran together to increase our survival rate and 
	still managed die a total of 9 times (6 my team mate, and 3 myself). Even 
	though I died more than I'm used to, it was still fun. It was also fun to 
	find that I was not the only one dieing. There were a couple people in 
	general chat mentioning that even after getting the reward, it did not burn 
	off all of their 20% Vitae. Also at 11:30 pm PST there were still a number 
	of un-recovered bodies scattered through the towns.<br>
	<br>
	I hope this information helps out.&quot;<br>

	Love your site, use it everyday. Anyway. At 9pm a message went out saying 
	that Grael's Forces were attacking Wei Jou. I took my followers Kenshin the 
	Wanderer and Strawberry' with me and we set out running from ob rim. When we 
	made it close to Wei Jou, we could hear the 2 shadow hunters screaming for 
	help. The town was in chaos, members from 5 different guilds fought among 
	each other as vast amounts of high level shadows attacked everyone. The 
	Shadow Hunter Killcrane was trapped inside a shadow prison and a 
	particularly vicious monster called &quot;Makkar&quot; was next to him. After fighting 
	our way into the town cutting through shadows and Isparians, we made it to 
	Makkar just after he was killed and despite a lot of war spells aimed out 
	way, me and Kenshin managed to loot 2 of his claws. Regretfully, we lost 
	Strawberry' in the attack and she wasn't able to loot a claw. We turned in 
	the claws to Killcrane and received about 47 million xp as well as the title 
	&quot;Killcrane's Ally&quot; in return for helping save him.<br>

	<br>
	Always a pleasure reporting for you!! Today in the world of HG, the 
	Whispering Blades were triumphant over the RM. It was a great Live Event!! 
	It was made even better by the Leaders of both sides, they did awesome 
	jobs!! About 60+ people showed at the WB chapterhouse today for this event!! 
	It was massive!! Around 5pm pst, the Black Knight showed (attached are 
	pictures ). We were given clues as to where we were to be able to find the 
	PK only dungeons for the crystals. The first dungeon was located in Tufa, 
	the second was located in Nedysa Castle (sp), and the 3rd was located in 
	Blue Spire right at the drop. It was great fun and I definitely think we 
	should have more of these events!! The prize for winning the event was a 
	large crystal that casts all level 7 life buffs on you!! Thx again to all 
	who participated in this live event!! It wouldn't have been fun without 
	all!! Thx again Maggie for your website, I use it everyday!! <br>

	<p align="left">Hi Maggie! <br>
	Let me first start of by saying I love your site! lol <br>
	<br>
	Our first dungeon was located near Candeth Keep. I got the first crystal 
	after a nasty battle.... But, instead of taking it to Dardante, I kept it 
	and dropped it in my villa chest. <br>
	<br>
	2nd dungeon was some-what close to Qual. Oro got that crystal and turned it 
	in for the Whispering Blade team.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, the third crystal... It was out by Wai Jhou. Snore Azoroth got that 
	crystal for team Whispering Blade and turned it in....<br>
	<br>
	Finally, after the event... As I was going to turn NPK, Count Dardante used 
	his magic and froze me. Then began to question me as to why I would do such 
	a thing to Rossu. I began to explain to him I was in the event as a 
	mercenary. I was a hired man to get the crystal for Chef Wubbie. The Count 
	then killed me twice, and told me I would be the first the darkness would 
	come for....<br>
	<br>
	All in all, the event was amazing on TD. I got my crystal and sold it to 
	Wubbie. My job was a complete success.<br>

	<p><b><a name="10"></a>Chef Wubbie's Side of the Story!</b></p>
	<p>Chef Wubbie reports: What was Chef Wubbie Thinking?<br>
	<br>
	At first, I was against the idea of a PK only event; I joined in on the 
	bashing and said I wouldn't participate. The more I thought about it and 
	read about the event, I thought hey, why not steal the event. Myth hijacked 
	the Shard of the Herald event and made it last much longer than it was 
	expected to. I admit my knowledge of the recent story arc is sketchy, but 
	it's not captivated me, and from posts I was seeing not many other people. 
	So the 3rd Option started. I was hoping to make it clear that the players 
	who hadn't chosen a faction should have just as much chance to affect the 
	event as 2 small factions, and possibly gain a different outcome and have 
	real server divergence.<br>
	<br>
	I posted on the Turbine boards and told them up front I was out to get 
	control of the event :). I also offered to give up for Pack Cows, but there 
	was no attempt made to bribe me. There 'might' have been some controversy 
	and speculation as to my real motives. The Devs finally posted in a thread 
	announcing that they had considered what might happen if a 3rd party won the 
	event, and no one working for the 3rd Option would be banned as this was a 
	possible outcome of the event. The idea of a 3rd Option spread to other 
	worlds. I don't know their outcomes; I hope they fared better. I would 
	really like to see the changes made to the future of that world. </p>
	<p>The 3rd Option was unable to gain any of the 3 crystals directly, but a 
	4th mercenary faction was embedded in at least one of the factions and after 
	the event, I purchased the crystal they controlled. I was hoping that the 
	idea of getting something different would motivate people to try the 3rd 
	Option and see the different outcome. I had hoped that even having just 1 
	crystal would lead to new lore and quests to try to decipher its purpose and 
	powers. There has been a Dev statement that its useless now and just a nice 
	trinket to remember the event.</p>
	<p>The upside I think for the game is how many times I had to explain the 
	event to people and bring people up to speed that there was a 3rd Option. 
	People showed a lot of interest, but due to time restraints, they were 
	unable to attend. There was a lot of support and several people came forward 
	to back my offers of MMDs to gain the crystals. I think a lot of people went 
	from &quot;oh a PK event&quot; to &quot;hey its an event where I can do something.&quot; In the 
	end the WB won with 2 crystals, but history will have to record that there 
	was someone from MR who got the first crystal and then offered it at auction 
	to anyone willing to bid.<br>
	I guess a simple chef had more resources than the Count and the Black 
	Knight. :D</p>
	<p>There were many people who helped me and I wish I remembered all of their 
	names, but they all know that they have a chef's help when they need it.<br>
	<br>
	Attached please find the screenshot of my pretty green crystal. I hope 
	someday its made hookable. In the meantime if you'd like to see the crystal 
	in person, for the low low price of 5 MMDs you too can see the crystal in a 
	trade window! :) Hey I spent 2k MMDs... I need to recoup my investment :)<br>
	<br>
	Chef Wubbie - TD - I always said I was waiting for the patch where 
	tradeskills would save the world... :D<br>

	<p>Hiya Maggie, hope you and your family are doing well. Here is the chat 
	log from the Rossu Morta Said from Friday's Live Event that was held on 
	Solclaim on 06-30-2006 at 8PM EST. Of special humorus note is this:<br>
	<br>
	You say, &quot;Count on behalf of the Rossu Morta I present you with this Holy 
	Nanner Pie. May it strike down that joke of a Queen. Just don't eat it. =)<br>

	You say, &quot;I live to serve&quot;<br>
	<font color="#D6D2DD">You bow deeply.<br>
	</font><br>
	There was humor, discipline within our ranks, emotes by the count, and just 
	in general a good time was had by all. Crowley, who played as Count Dardante, 
	did an excellent job staying in character and we had a lot of fun with this 
	event. Crowley even mentioned the Nanner Pie I gave him on the official 
	forums here:<br>

	<br>
	Been around since Dec 1999 but have taken several breaks in between ... just 
	got back to AC couple months ago :) Yesterday I was in Arwic, alone, 
	wondering how fast this twisted shadow would send me to the LS when all of a 
	sudden a group of 25 or so came in and started clearing everything. I joined 
	them and made it through 5 of the 7 towns (only missing Tufa and Sawato 
	which I have no idea how I'm going to get now) - anyway along the journey I 
	took several pics and got some awesome views I thought I would share with 
	you. Hope you find them useful.<br>

	<p>Endrin the Mercenary reports: &quot;Hi Maggie, When the live event started, me 
	and my follower Kenshin the Wanderer recalled to the whispering blade house. 
	There were a lot of people there. We made 3 fellowships and the Black Knight 
	told us to first search near Stonehold. I found the dungeon first; it was 
	Muck Warrens. It took a long time to locate the crystal inside. Just as the 
	crystal was destroyed, the Rossu Morta showed up and attacked. Someone in 
	the WB managed to take the crystal and get back to the chapterhouse, 
	although I'm not sure who. <br>
	<br>
	The Black Knight informed us the second crystal was near Sawato and joked 
	about what a nice town it was. Me and Sly Xaojin made it to the dungeon at 
	about the same time. It was a temple of some kind, I don't recall which one. 
	We made it to the crystal and killed it before the Rossu Morta even got to 
	the dungeon. I took the crystal back to the Black Knight and got a nifty 
	inscription on my shield. </p><font face="arial" size="2">

	<p>The third crystal was in the Renegade Incursion dungeon by Teth. I was 
	the third or forth person there. I died at the crystal in the ensuing chaos 
	as the Rossu Morta and Whispering Blade made it there at about the same 
	time. The Rossu Morta took the crystal, but it never made it into the hands 
	of Count Dardante as reports say he was killed by members of the Rossu Morta 
	in his own chapterhouse. Many spies and traitors also attempted to kill the 
	Black Knight during the battle for the crystals. Rob the Hand killed many 
	members of the Whispering Blade inside the chapterhouse with ravens fury. 
	Kenshin the Wanderer valiantly defended the Black Knight against multiple 
	foes. After the crystals, Adso showed up to talk to the Black Knight. As 
	Adso attempted to depart, however, he was killed by Circa Survive. All in 
	all, it was a very long, hard and confusing battle, but the Whispering Blade 
	prevailed on Darktide!&quot;</p>

	Jin Saotome of MT reports: &quot;</font>Heya Maggie! The live event in Arwic hit! 
	The Shadow Breach appeared, some sort of portal in the middle of Arwic's 
	crater surrounded by vicious Murkkir and a Makkar. We killed them and they 
	dropped &quot;Necklaces of dark rage&quot;. Nobody could get into the portal, however! 
	I figured it out; you equip the necklace and then use the portal, like your 
	Whispering Blade/Rossu ring to enter a chapterhouse. I was all alone, 
	dropped into a bunch of Void Knights and Wretcheds till I told the rest of 
	my team how I got in, heh. We all traveled down to the bottom where a level 
	999 Shadow Vortex was waiting. It does MASSIVE Bludgeoning damage and shoots 
	spells at you. Some people got 1-hit by its physical attack. It did over 
	200+ to me and I had to back up, thank god it doesn't go anywhere. Once 
	defeated, a gateway opened up that led back to the Arwic Crater. We were 
	victorious! Here's some pics!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He adds: &quot;Maggie, me again! Turn in your inactive device to Rordian 
	Nightbane and show him an amulet. he gives you Grael's Claw! Show the amulet 
	to Sarkin and get the new Knight of the Golden Flame title and tiered XP!&quot;</p>

	<p>HG reports: &quot;This is ongoing right now as acclient.exe just encountered a 
	problem and needed to close. *whimper*<br>
	<br>
	The Vortex got hammered down well enough, although it's got a Tentacle-style 
	melee attack that took out a few people who went into the Pit. Its death 
	spawned the teaser pic and a new type of those ugly black things, from whose 
	corpses can be looted an amulet. You have to wear that amulet to go through 
	the new portal. You can take it off again once inside. We're not sure what, 
	if any difference that makes.&quot;<br>
