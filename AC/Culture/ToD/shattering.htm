	August 14, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">It was the darkest time of night in Ayan Baqur, with 
	dawn still over an hour away. A woman in scholar's robes sat at a table in 
	the Smoking Axe tavern, reading through a thick pile of papers by 
	candlelight. She seemed to be the only person in the building. Old Berkholt, 
	the barkeep, had gone for the night, and even Ulgrim was asleep, softly 
	snoring by the side of the building.<br>
	<br>
	A man appeared at the entryway to the tavern. His black leather armor 
	blended against the darkness outside, and it took a moment for the seated 
	scholar to make him out through the light of the candles inside. He stepped 
	into the tavern, eyes darting alertly around the room, and sneered when his 
	eyes met the scholar's.<br>
	<br>
	There was an audible click from the second story of the tavern, and another 
	figure in dark leather armor moved into sight. In the dim recesses of the 
	second level, she'd blended perfectly against the shadowed bulk of a couch. 
	Now she moved enough into the light that both the seated scholar and the 
	newcomer could see, perfectly well, the crossbow in her hand, pointed at the 
	man in the doorway.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No further, assassin,&quot; she hissed from her vantage point. &quot;You are not the 
	Whispering Blade we expected.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The man in the doorway had his hand on his dagger and it looked like he was 
	ready to fight. A second figure appeared behind him – another woman dressed 
	in robes. She put her hand on the fighter's shoulder and turned to address 
	the woman at the table.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I am the one you expected, Lamorda. My associate is merely taking the same 
	precautions with my security that your own Rossu Morta dog seems to have 
	done,&quot; she said.<br>
	<br>
	Lamorda smiled from her seat at the table. &quot;Let us both accept that we are 
	sensible and cautious people, Soju, and be done with this posturing. I'll 
	order my friend to stand down if you will do likewise.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So be it,&quot; Soju said, patting her armed associate again on the shoulder. He 
	relaxed his stance and released his dagger. Lamorda made a hand gesture to 
	the assassin in the second level, who pointed her crossbow back up at the 
	ceiling.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Of course, there are limits to accommodation,&quot; Soju said, as she motioned 
	her companion to an alcove on the second level opposite the Rossu Morta 
	assassin's perch. He took station by an end table, with a crossbow of his 
	own at the ready.<br>
	<br>
	Lamorda rolled her eyes. &quot;If you must.&quot; Soju came forward, producing her own 
	pile of papers. She sat at the table across from Lamorda, shuffling her 
	papers and attempting to sort them into some kind of order. After a few 
	wordless moments, she smirked at her counterpart across the table.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It seemed only wise to bring my own security, since you Rossu Morta 
	butchers seem to take the call of the shadows far too seriously. Tell me, 
	how fares your former Grand Master? Still devouring souls as he trots in the 
	heels of the demon? That is, if he is indeed your former Grand Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lamorda bristled at Soju's needling. &quot;Dardante is attainted and no longer 
	one of us.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Soju lifted her hands in a placating gesture. &quot;Yes, of course, we have all 
	heard about how the Rossu Morta declared him anathema, once they discovered 
	just what a bad man they had issuing directives to their spies, assassins, 
	and torturers... About how your mad king finally got wise to the shadowy 
	viper in his house and cast him out, just a few months too late to --&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No more about Dardante or the King,&quot; the Rossu Morta assassin interrupted. 
	She leveled her crossbow at Soju, which prompted the Whispering Blade 
	assassin to point his own crossbow at Lamorda.<br>
	<br>
	Lamorda sighed heavily. &quot;Stand down, both of you,&quot; she barked. <br>
	<br>
	The Whispering Blade assassin laughed in response and kept his crossbow 
	poised. &quot;I don't take orders from Dardante's twisted dogs. You may claim he 
	is not one of you, but it seems to me that this truce you're peddling is 
	just a prelude to further treachery.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Enough!&quot; This time it was Soju yelling a command. She looked over her 
	shoulder at her own companion. &quot;Put up your weapon,&quot; she said wearily. &quot;And 
	no more comments from you unless there is a legitimate threat.&quot; She turned 
	to Lamorda. &quot;I apologize unreservedly for my remarks about your former Grand 
	Master.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Slowly, and with many suspicious glances at Lamorda and her companion, the 
	Whispering Blade assassin pointed his crossbow back at the ceiling. After a 
	heartbeat's hesitation and a dirty look from Lamorda, his Rossu Morta 
	counterpart did the same.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Lamorda said brightly. &quot;Now no one has any crossbows pointed at 
	them. Did you bring your papers on the geomantic studies your people have 
	done? I need to examine them to see if they will work with our own 
	research...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I did not bring those papers,&quot; Soju said. &quot;I am prepared to answer specific 
	questions, but I cannot share it all with you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;That is foolish, Soju,&quot; said Lamorda. &quot;Withholding that information is a 
	sign of bad faith.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It is a sign of no faith, Lamorda,&quot; Soju responded. &quot;We'll work with you, 
	but we cannot trust you. Tell me, did you bring the full treatise on the 
	principles of ritualized sympathetic magic?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, no, but only parts of that treatise are at all useful to –&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I rest my case,&quot; Soju snapped, clearly annoyed.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;How predictable,&quot; said a voice from the tavern's entryway. In a flash, two 
	crossbows were leveled at the intruder. A man stood silhouetted just outside 
	the threshold of the tavern. His scale armor looked black in the darkness. 
	There was a flurry of movement, and a pair of blades flashed from his hands. 
	The crossbows wielded by the assassins on the second floor went flying from 
	their hands, daggers embedded in their stocks.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You children play nice together and share all your toys. Or none of you 
	gets out of here alive.&quot; Oswald stepped into the light, another brace of 
	daggers clutched in his hand. &quot;Do not think to test me on this. I've been 
	uncharacteristically restrained recently, and I am so very eager to work out 
	my frustrations on someone.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Soju and Lamorda looked at each other as their companions cursed softly. 
	Finally, the two scholars nodded to each other, and then to Oswald.<br>
	<br>
	Oswald smiled. &quot;Well done. I knew you two had it in you to work together, at 
	least when threatened with a painful and messy demise. And after you two 
	have put your heads together, you'll come back here to work with one of my 
	own people. And you'll dress more prudently. Armored. No robes. There's no 
	telling what strange and terrible things lurk in the dark around here.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He smiled toothily, sheathed his daggers, and came to the table.</span></p>

	August 17, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">Ranarre stood outside the door to the King's private 
	study, breathing deeply to steady his nerves. He closed his eyes, took one 
	last breath, and knocked on the door. There was a pause of a few heartbeats, 
	and then he heard the King's voice come through the door: &quot;Enter.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He opened the door and stepped through. The only illumination in the room 
	was a guttering candle on the King's desk. King Varicci II, monarch of the 
	domain of New Viamont, sat at the desk, his face lit luridly by the 
	flickering light of the candle. The overall effect to Ranarre's eyes was 
	that his King sat suspended in a tenuous bubble of light in the darkness of 
	the room.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Come forward, where I can see your face. Your name is Ranarre, yes?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes, Your Majesty.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ranarre stepped into the light and looked at his King. Varicci's eyes were 
	bloodshot, his hair was unkempt, his face unshaven, and he smelled like 
	hadn't bathed in a few days. Ranarre then risked a glance at the papers on 
	the desk. He saw a complicated diagram with precisely rendered drawings of a 
	Ruschk, a Mukkir, and a shadowy humanoid form that he'd come to recognize as 
	the &quot;Shadows&quot; that so intrigued his former master, the disgraced Count 
	Dardante. The sides of the pages were covered with scrolling sigils in an 
	arcane language that Ranarre had spent the last several months studying.<br>
	<br>
	Varicci noted this and smiled ever so faintly. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, answering 
	Ranarre's unasked question, &quot;this is the result of the cooperation for which 
	you argued so convincingly. I believe we have solved the mystery of Grael. 
	Your ideas were the seed of our solution.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;That is good news, Your Majesty,&quot; Ranarre murmured.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You should be rewarded for your vision and perseverance. Even when Dardante 
	threatened you, a mere field researcher, for questioning his intentions, you 
	did not back down.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I am grateful that you think well of my efforts, Your Majesty. It was only 
	my duty.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes... duty. Let us now speak of the future of your organization.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As you wish, Your Majesty.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci grimaced. &quot;I made a mistake with Dardante.&quot; He looked searchingly 
	into Ranarre's eyes. Ranarre tried to keep his expression as neutral as 
	possible. Finally, Varicci continued. &quot;I was so desperate to find a weapon 
	that I could use to crush the Bloodless Queen, I failed to see that Dardante 
	had gone out of my control. I then compounded my mistake by putting him in 
	charge of the Rossu Morta. It accelerated his own fall into madness, and his 
	agenda corrupted the organization. Do you agree with my assessment?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ranarre took another deep, steadying breath, then looked directly into his 
	King's cold eyes and nodded. &quot;I do, Your Majesty. Dardante began working for 
	his own ends and was given too much latitude to do so.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci nodded. It was a quick movement, the barest twitch of his head, but 
	Ranarre caught it. &quot;The mistakes I made have caused me to reconsider my 
	actions. There are forces at work in this world, I finally have realized, 
	that are... dangerous to treat with.&quot; He sighed heavily and rubbed his 
	temples. Ranarre was mildly shocked. He had never seen the King this tired 
	or uncertain of himself. He finally felt compelled to prompt the King with a 
	question.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What will you do, Your Majesty?&quot; Varicci stared off into space, and Ranarre 
	began to think the King was just ignoring him. Finally, he looked back at 
	Ranarre and spoke.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I will not disband the Rossu Morta. They can still be a potent tool, 
	because we are not done with the Bloodless Queen. I still need their 
	services. But they are worse than useless if I cannot trust them.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I will help you in any way I can, Your Majesty. But I must warn you, it 
	will not be easy to root out the corrupt elements.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I know, Ranarre. It seems to me that many of my advisors in recent days 
	have been foolish or corrupt. You are one of the few who has been willing to 
	speak the truth to me. Several high-ranking officers of the Rossu Morta 
	stood in this room, in the very spot where you stand now, and assured me 
	that every bloody-handed assassin and soul-devouring mage in the 
	organization was loyal. Each of those liars has been tossed to the Eaters.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ranarre swallowed nervously and lowered his eyes. Varicci measured his 
	silence and went on. &quot;I have a mind to put you in charge of the Rossu Morta, 
	Ranarre. You had the courage to confront Dardante and the honesty to speak 
	unpleasant truths to me. You have proven yourself to have a keen analytical 
	mind. Your work in the field has shown you to be adaptable and versatile. 
	You are the one I would trust to reshape the Rossu Morta into a focused, 
	effective, and loyal organization.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ranarre sank to his knees. &quot;I am not worthy of this honor, Your Majesty. I 
	am just a researcher, not a soul-binder or a fighter.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci chuckled. &quot;And you are so thoroughly unambitious, I would not worry 
	about you usurping the Rossu Morta's loyalties from underneath me. Would you 
	deny my request?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I would not, Your Majesty. I am yours to command.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Good, then. Rise, Count Ranarre, new Grand Master of the Ordina Rossu 
	Morta. May your tenure be longer and less turbulent than your 
	predecessor's.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Knees shaking, Ranarre stood. &quot;I suggest you find some trustworthy 
	lieutenants and bodyguards. Your task will be dangerous. I will give you 
	what aid I can – but I think it is critical that you master the organization 
	without relying on me. You must prove yourself to those you would lead. Move 
	cautiously, but surely. You must find a proper balance between prudence and 
	boldness. And if there is anyone who gives you reason to doubt their 
	loyalties... You must kill them, quickly and mercilessly.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As you say, Your Grace.&quot; Ranarre nodded, though sweat was already beading 
	on his forehead, and his thoughts were taking an increasingly panicked tone.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Now... I'd like to take advantage of your expertise on another matter,&quot; 
	Varicci said. He opened a desk drawer, withdrew a small figure, and set it 
	on the desk. It was like a children's doll, but black, batwinged, and 
	crafted in the shape of the demon, Grael.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Our agents obtained this from a newcomer in Sanamar who proclaimed himself 
	to be an emissary of Ulgrim, that old drunk in Ayan Baqur. What in the name 
	of Karlun's glowing bones is it for?&quot;</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello there and welcome to the August edition of the 
	Letter to the Players. <br>
	<br>
	During this past month we have seen Grael wreak havoc on several towns 
	throughout Dereth. The trail of death and destruction was hard to miss as 
	Grael and his minions tore across the land. Is there anyway to stop Grael in 
	time to save Dereth?<br>
	<br>
	Before we get into all of the new and updated things in the August event we 
	would like to announce that we are now offering a special discount on the 
	purchase of Asheron's Call: Throne of Destiny. When you purchase AC: ToD 
	from the Turbine store, simply enter the code ACSTORE10 in to the box marked 
	promo code on the purchase page. This will give you $10 off of the retail 
	price of $19.99. That means for a limited time everyone can purchase Throne 
	of Destiny for $9.99. This is just one of the many steps we are taking to 
	keep new and returning players coming in to Dereth. Please feel free to 
	share this code with your friends and family, so they can take advantage of 
	this great offer and join us in Dereth. This code is a limited time offer 
	and will expire September 30th 2006.<br>
	<br>
	Now let's see what is new and exciting this month in Asheron's Call this 
	month!<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b><br>
	Several weeks ago we had some unfortunate issues with our Authentication 
	servers which caused many of our loyal players to be unable to enter the 
	game worlds. We understand this was troubling for many, and we want the 
	opportunity to show our appreciation for everyone remaining patient with us 
	while we worked through the issue. To that end, when players log into the 
	game after the August event goes live they will be able to head to one of 
	Ulgrim's Emissaries located in several of the towns around Dereth and 
	receive a special pack doll. This is no ordinary pack doll though. Players 
	who so choose can turn the pack doll back in to the Emissary for a free 
	level. Everyone who is able to log in to the game during the August event, 
	with the exception of newly created characters, will be eligible for this 
	reward. The pack dolls will be tradable but you may only turn in one for a 
	free level. After that you will be able to take any others you have and hook 
	them in your home, or save them for a special occasion. You will only be 
	able to turn in the pack doll for a free level during the August event. Once 
	the August event is over, Ulgrim's Emissaries will be gone and so with them 
	the ability to get a free level from the Pack Doll. We once again would like 
	to thank all our players for their understanding while we resolved the 
	issues. <br>
	<br>
	In our continuing efforts to help our new players along in Dereth, we have 
	adjusted the amount of Pyreals that new players get upon entering the world. 
	In the past when a new character was created they would start with 500 
	Pyreals. After the August event goes live. New characters will enter the 
	world with 10,000 Pyreals. This is another of many improvements we want to 
	make to help our newer players enjoy their early days in Dereth. <br>
	<br>
	Due to popular demand by players we have increased the stack size of Pyreals 
	from 10,000 to 25,000. Based on feedback we may increase the stack size 
	further in the coming months. <br>
	<br>
	Several changes have been made to the Harbinger quest. We have lowered the 
	difficulty of the mid level version to be more in line with what we had 
	originally wanted. Please be aware when going through this quest that there 
	were several small changes made as well, though the overall experience 
	should remain close the same.<br>
	<br>
	Shadow Eddy's have been toned down some in order to stop them from killing 
	anything that moves. They will still be difficult, but players should not be 
	as easily killed by them now. <br>
	<br>
	Based on player feedback we have made the final part of the Raising Grael's 
	Island quest repeatable. If you have already done this quest and no longer 
	have access to the dungeon, just speak to the starter NPC again and you will 
	then be able to enter the dungeon again and help others get through their 
	task.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. With each 
	monthly event we will be discussing an in concept topic, in order to give 
	you as much information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Non- Combat Pets</b><br>
	One thing that we have found over the years of working on this game is never 
	say never when it comes to what can and cannot be done with this game. This 
	is just another example of that. Not long ago it was asked in one form or 
	another if Asheron's Call would ever have pets. The answer given at the time 
	was not likely given our current tech. Well times have changed and we are 
	proud to say that we have found a way to make pets work. The first examples 
	of pets will be introduced as Non-Combat pets. They will be critters who 
	will follow you around wherever you go that they can follow. In the coming 
	months if the first versions of pets are a success, we may see other more 
	useful versions of pets. The kind of pets that may be able to do more than 
	just look cute and follow you around. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	August and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	August event.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you again for your loyalty, and don't forget to invite your family and 
	friends to join us here in Dereth.<br>
