	</b>Hi Maggie<br>
	<br>
	I had gotten a pitiful tree from the frosthaven quest. A bunch of us were 
	gathered at the mansion talking about the rewards and Trinstar came up with 
	the idea to try to put a blue blanket around it just like in the charlie 
	brown christmas cartoon. Multani placed the blanket on it and sure enough! 
	This message popped up... Multani says, 'You wrap the blue blanket around 
	the base of the little tree. It's not such a bad little tree really.' The 
	lights twinkle on it just like the holiday lights.<br>
	<br>
	Both tree screen shots are included.<br>

	Hi Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	Great site :) Running through the dires I came across some banderling 
	aggressors. After hitting a few a Dire Champion Banderling spawned. On it, 
	it had a Dire Champion Token. I gave this to Aun Javhalrea, the Game Warden 
	in Ayan and he awarded me with 5 Million XP and the title of Banderling 
	Bully. Not sure if it's new or not but couldn't find on your site! Please 
	see attached pics :)<br>

	Sanddh of WE sends this summary: &quot;Eyas Maggie, After running around the 
	Dires killing almost anything on my way, I found in total 8 sort of Dire 
	Champions. Since after the 8th different Champion I got a new title (see 
	screenies) for tracking these 8, I guess this is it.<br>
	<br>
	Usually, I had to wait for the spawn to fully develop. However, I didn't 
	need to finish the spawn completely before the champion spawned. Single 
	creatures of the same species never gave me a champ. <br>
	<br>
	Since even after killing 5 or more fully developed spawns of the following 
	critters, I guess they don't give champions (yet): grievvers, shrets, 
	tummies, sclavii, mossies, dillos, olthoi, guruk &amp; burun, undead (tried the 
	mu'miyads and the phantasm/darkmaster ones), moarsmen, and the critters that 
	usually spawn alone, such as wisps, zefirs and crystals.<br>
	<br>
	My list :)<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Bandie<br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a bandie-only spawn of Agressors and such<br>
	Title: Banderling Bully<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Virindi <br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a mixed spawn of virindi, hollows and tuskers<br>
	Title: Xenophobic<br>
	(Utterly btw, as an archer I hated this one, did very little damage, and 
	took ages to kill because of his armor and his heal and drain spells)<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Drudge <br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a drudge-only spawn of Bloodletters, Peerless &amp; 
	Cabalists<br>
	Title: Dire Drudge Decapitator<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Lugie h)<br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a lugie only spawn of Titans and Juggernauts<br>
	Title: Renegade Hunter <br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Shadow <br>
	Found: near Dires coast between AB and CK, close to withered tummie area<br>
	Spawned after killing a shadow-only spawn of Abyssal, Sinister, Tenebrous<br>
	Title: Shadow Sunderer <br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Golem <br>
	Found: near Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a golem only spawn of Gold Golems<br>
	Title: Gold Farmer<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Skellie <br>
	Found: coast east of Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a skellie only spawn of armored skellies and skeletal 
	heroes (I guess the Dark Myrmidon was a coincidence ;) )<br>
	Title: Antropologist<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Monouga<br>
	Found: northeast of Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a monouga-only spawn of Bloodthirsty, Pugnacious and

	15:41:41 Town Crier tells you, &quot;Asheron has asked for our help. Speak to the 
	Elemental in his tower off the coast of Eastham.&quot;<br>
	So I headed to Eastham (17.9N 64.3E and used asheron's island portal.) Then 
	used Asheron's Castle portal.
	Then once inside asheron's sanctum I talked to Asheron. He then gave me 3 
	tasks to perform. So I headed off to Fort Teth.
	After talking to the NPC, he sent me to the Cathedreal of ves isles. <br>
	<br>
	I used the Ithnaec Quiddity seed and it portaled me.
	After fighting the Thief of Dreams for about 10 minutes, he self buffs and 
	has nice magicD, I got an Avoren skull which I gave to the shade of Dule.
	He summoned a gateway to a dungeon of buttons, bile grievers, and penumbral 
	soldiers. After a lengthy fight with him I looted the claw of hopeslayer.
	I returned to for teth and gave the Aun my claw, got an empowered 
	thaumatergic pauldoron, quiddity ingot, 139 mil, and the title Hope of the 
	Past.<br>
	<br>
	Next I headed to stonehold for the Knorr section. I gave the lugian my MMD 
	to get a knorr portal gem and went in looking for the Planar Collegium.
	I entered the Planar Collegium portal, After working my way through the 
	place by first using a torch, then a series of levers I made my way through 
	the dungeon.<br>
	I found a Journeyman portal, used it. Then went into the Planar lecture 
	halls, then headmaster room where I finally found another quiddity seed.<br>
	Asheron then spawned after I used the quidd seed, and started casting 
	something. I saw a virindi portal but could not enter. Asheron was casting a 
	spell that was protecting his people he said, but weakening him.
	you must kill the virindi portals before Ash dies. Then take the reward to 
	him in the real life.<br>
	I went back to his castle and gave him the spherule. This time I got a 
	breastplate, quid ingot, title Protector of the Past, and 200 mil.<br>
	<br>
	I have yet to finish the 3rd part, but this will get you 2/3 done. :)</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Kalazar of SC continuation 
	of the first writeup. I finally found the 3rd quid. seed in the BDC (Black 
	Death Catacombs) It was right beside the paradox portal. It's unactivated at 
	the moment though. (Need to find NPC or possibly a live event to actiavate 
	it)<br>
	<br>
	Thanks Maggie :)</font></span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Asheron 
	tells you, &quot;Welcome, I'm glad you've come.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;From my observations and from reports I've received from 
	your Queen I believe that Aerbax is attempting something quite unheard of.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;It would seem our enemy has been tampering with the 
	collective memories of three critical events in the past. He has built three 
	dream structures using Quiddity Seeds to allow him to attack these memories 
	and change our perspective in the present.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;The first Quiddity Seed is in Knorr where I first 
	summoned the portals that sent my people into portal space.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;The second Quiddity Seed's location still alludes me. I 
	believe that the Aun Tumeroks may have more experience in locating these 
	dream structures. Visit Fort Tethana where an emissary of the Tumerokds has 
	been sent to meet you.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;The third and final Quiddity Seed was not found by my 
	divinations. I only have a vague idea of what memory may be at risk. Seek 
	out an apparition in the Northern Desert who I have been told will help 
	you.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;Do not take these tasks likely. Our memories form the 
	way we see the world around us. Change our memories and change reality. This 
	is a very real threat.&quot;<br>
	Asheron tells you, &quot;If Aerbax succeeds we may not even remember we were 
	trying to stop him.&quot;</font></span></p>

	have to clean it and polish it and maybe refacet it again, but at least I

	Blind Snowman tells you, &quot;Thank you, thank you. Here you deserve a reward 
	for all of your help. Let's see... well not see per se... one second.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FFCC">The Blind Snowman scoops up a pile of snow and casts a

	if alive.<br>
	Blind Snowman gives you Neydisa Snowglobe.</font><br>

	Blind Snowman tells you, &quot;May your bottom stay cold and your eyes stay put. 
	Soon I'll be able to see the snow again!&quot;</font><br>
