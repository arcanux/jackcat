	<p>
    Adso stalked through the swamp under cover of night, moving from bush to 
	bush in a hunched crawl that was a compromise between his need for stealth 
	and his desire to keep his nose out of the fetid marsh water. The water in 
	this area smelled particularly foul. It reeked of all the familiar swamp 
	gases that he’d come to know and loathe in his past excursions into 
	Blackmire, but it also carried with it a new and less familiar odor. It was 
	a sharp, cloying odor, redolent of ozone. He stopped for a moment, trying to 
	place the scent, trying to remember where he’d last encountered this odor…<br>
	<br>
	“Scent can be an important tool,” Master had told him once, at the start of 
	their training. “Often times, moving through forest or jungle, the smell of 
	your prey will alert you to their presence before you can see or hear them. 
	Especially if you are hunting Mosswarts or Banderlings. Conversely, your 
	smell will almost certainly betray your presence if you’re stalking any kind 
	of animal, and certain well-trained humans as well.” Master had smiled 
	sharply at this, always amused by his own jokes. “Always try and approach 
	from downwind, my apprentice. Or, failing that, try rolling around in some 
	muck and dirt if you’re stalking prey out in the wilds, and maybe your 
	milk-drinking man-stink won’t give you away.”<br>
	<br>
	Adso reflected on that advice as he hunkered in the muck of the swamp. He 
	was already covered toe to neck in the effluvium of the Blackmire, and the 
	reek was starting to interfere with his own sense of smell. He dared not 
	dunk his head in, to block his nose and mouth with the stink.<br>
	<br>
	He shook his head, breaking himself out of his reverie, and bent his mind 
	back to the task at hand. He could see lights ahead, just a stone’s throw 
	away. A few minutes later, after very careful and stealthy progress, he 
	spotted the source of activity through a gap in the undergrowth. Somehow the 
	Tanada had constructed a Sho tower in the swamp! He could see a few human 
	forms, silhouetted by firelight, moving back and forth in front of the 
	tower’s opening. There also appeared to be some kind of earthworks in the 
	vicinity, a pile of earth excavated from the festering ground and piled near 
	the tower.<br>
	<br>
	Adso found a good ambush spot in the lee of a banyan tree and watched for 
	patrols. As he waited, he checked on the state of his enchantments, making 
	sure that the armoring spells set on his well-worn leather armor were still 
	strong. He’d fought the Tanada enough times to appreciate the help of a good 
	armor enchantment.<br>
	<br>
	Satisfied with the state of his armor, he watched as a sentry walked out 
	near his position from the tower. Grinning in anticipation of a clean and 
	satisfying kill, he readied his knife, also blessed with powerful 
	enchantments, and allowed the prey to come to him.<br>
	<br>
	The Tanada moved stealthily and warily, showing an admirable sense of 
	discipline as he patrolled the outer perimeter of this godforsaken outpost. 
	He moved as if expecting attack at any moment, but he did not seem to show 
	any awareness that Adso was there. <br>
	<br>
	Adso’s own skill proved to be superior to the Tanada’s. In the hazy night of 
	the swamp, where moonlight filtered unevenly through the trees and swamp 
	gases flickered in the distance, Adso’s strike could not have been more 
	perfect. He was a silent shadow, flitting out briefly from the shelter of 
	the banyan to grab the patrolling assassin. In one swift movement, he 
	wrapped one arm around the Tanada’s throat and mouth, plunging his 
	thick-bladed knife into the back of the Tanada’s neck, cleanly severing the 
	spinal column even as he closed in on his foe. An efficient, nearly 
	bloodless kill, so that his enemies would not even be alerted by the smell 
	of blood.<br>
	<br>
	The Tanada collapsed without a sound, and Adso laid the corpse neatly down 
	in the shadow of the banyan tree where he’d been hiding. The body disposed 
	of, he stalked out into the swamp once more, moving slowly towards the tower 
	again. He could see two more guards. If he was lucky, he could get to the 
	tower and the dig site without alerting any of them. He still hadn’t decided 
	which one to investigate first. He was under no illusions that he’d long 
	remain undiscovered as soon as he breached the threshold of either 
	structure.<br>
	<br>
	Barely a minute after his clean and perfect kill, he noticed a stirring from 
	the earthworks. He could see half a dozen Tanada, clad in scaly dark armor 
	that looked black in the dim light, streaming swiftly from the opening in 
	the ground. They were all coming towards his position. They all had blades 
	out. They made not a sound as they swarmed towards him.<br>
	<br>
	This shouldn’t have been possible. How could they know where he was? It was 
	almost as if they were in instant communication with each other…<br>
	<br>
	There was a splash behind him. One of the Tanada had dropped out of the 
	branches of the very tree where he’d stashed the first murdered assassin. 
	This one bore no weapons, but his fingers were bunched and pointed in a 
	position that Adso had among the most advanced practitioners of the Sho 
	fighting arts. He had no time to defend himself. The assassin’s hand jabbed 
	forward, almost too fast to track, and he felt an explosion of pain in his 
	ribs.<br>
	<br>
	“Nonsense,” he said, as he felt the too-keen bite of an iron-hard hand. 
	“Armor spell… failed…” He hadn’t felt a punch that hard since he’d tangled 
	with that nest of Hollow Minions…<br>
	<br>
	All of a sudden it made sense. The responsiveness of the Tanada guards, the 
	sharp tang of otherworldly corruption in the air, the assassin’s fist that 
	blasted through his magical protection like a dagger through cheap linen…<br>
	<br>
	The world went light, and he blacked out before the other Tanada arrived to 
	finish him off.</p>

	<p>Borelean, prince of New Aluvia and leader of the Whispering Blade, turned 
	back to view the tactical map which had caused such consternation of late.<br>
	<br>
	A map of the island of Dereth had been unrolled upon the table, depicting 
	the land from the rain forests of the Vesayens to the cold Viamontian 
	strongholds of Marae Lassel and the Halaetans, and from the tainted 
	wildernesses of Vissidalthe Dark Isle to the strange formation known as the 
	Singularity Caul. Borelean pointed at markers that had been placed at 
	various points upon the map.<br>
	<br>
	“Cragstone… the Vesayens… the Direlands… Tusker Island… and the Olthoi 
	infestation in the northeast. What in the name of all that is good is the 
	connection?” he asked the room at large, frustration in his voice. <br>
	<br>
	“I do not know, but perhaps the more compelling question is how our enemy 
	has the resources and power to undertake actions in all of these different 
	places,” responded a slender, black-haired young Sho woman clad in white 
	robes. <br>
	<br>
	Borelean ran his hand through his sandy brown hair. While it was held back 
	by a circlet, his hair’s natural inclination was to flop forward towards his 
	eyes, further irritating him. Still, he had learned enough about leadership 
	to refrain from unleashing his impatience and impetuosity upon those who sat 
	in attendance to advise him.<br>
	<br>
	The first of his companions was Hoshino Kei, whom he knew primarily from 
	studying with Harlune and from the subsequent creation of the portal to Bur. 
	Kei’s eyes were careful to obscure any emotions she felt about the 
	situation, and her motions guarded. Borelean had asked her to be present as 
	a second opinion should higher magics be involved… and because he did not 
	wish to involve any of his mother Queen Elysa’s own magical advisors.<br>
	<br>
	The second was his colleague and occasional rival, Adso. HWhile he was never 
	certain that he could fully trust this shadowy blondfair-haired man with the 
	shadowy reputation, knowing precisely who his master was. However, he also 
	respected Adso’s insight, and he could not see a way that their master would 
	benefit from this new enemy gaining influence over Dereth. Adso had seen 
	much of the activity within Dereth, and he could be trusted to be discreet.<br>
	<br>
	The last was a pessimistic scout by the name of Ardry the Dubious. It was 
	said that he ended up at his lifestone more often than one normally should, 
	and yet still managed to be as well-informed as anyone about the goings-on 
	in Dereth. While normally reports came through Aliester the Loquacious, in 
	this case Borelean desired a personal appearance by the one who had seemed 
	to suffer so much in the name of New Aluvia. Ardry and Adso had exchanged 
	pointed looks, and Borelean could sense the rivalry in the air, but he had 
	no time for such foolishness at this meeting. <br>
	<br>
	“You’re right, Kei,” Borelean acknowledged, allowing a small amount of 
	praise to overcome his grudging acceptance of her superior analysis. In the 
	time they had spent studying together, the prince had grown to admire the 
	sorceress’s ability to assess a situation and efficiently work towards a 
	solution. Borelean glanced toward Adso and Ardry and continued, “Tell me 
	more about the resources and power of our enemy.”<br>
	<br>
	“Those whom I’ve encountered have proven more organized and more 
	strategically savvy than before,” Ardry contributed, “It’s as if the 
	traditionally disorganized monsters of the land all decided that they would 
	be more effective unifying under strong leaders…well, all but the 
	Banderlings. The leaders are exhibiting increased intelligence and skill 
	beyond their previously known capabilities. The sorts of modification 
	alteration exhibited so far, and the experimental logs that have been 
	retrieved, resemble what the Virindi have done in the past.”<br>
	<br>
	Adso coolly nodded, then added, “My encounter with the Tanada also implies 
	Virindi involvement. I think that the answer may lie in portal space.”<br>
	<br>
	“Portal space?” Ardry asked, “That’s an awfully large place to look.”<br>
	<br>
	Borelean tapped his finger pensively upon the map. The others in the room 
	remained silent for a moment, awaiting the prince’s forthcoming comment. 
	Finally, Borelean spoke in a quiet, assured tone. <br>
	<br>
	“The opening of the portal to Bur taught me something about the intricacies 
	of portal space. It is a difficult place to understand – its spatial 
	presence does not work in the same way as the world we know. It cannot be 
	navigated easily, except in certain very stable pocketss, generally created 
	by the Virindi or some other powerful portal mage. I wouldn’t know how to 
	find anything without some clear anchor to start from,” Borelean quietly 
	said, sounding defeated.<br>
	<br>
	“We may have an anchor,” Hoshino Kei answered, “Do you recall the reports 
	about the Monougas being held in the cavern in the Direlands?”<br>
	<br>
	“Yes, but I do not see how you mean it.”<br>
	<br>
	“I do, Borelean,” Adso commented, “The Monougas in that cavern are not 
	always there. They are portalled in from some other location.”<br>
	<br>
	Comprehension dawned in Borelean’s eyes. “So, then, you ask if I can trace 
	this portal back? I can try,” he said, punctuating his statement with an 
	emphatic gesture towards the Direlands on the map. He looked at the three 
	gathered with him in the room.<br>
	<br>
	“What is your command, your Highness?” Ardry asked. Adso smirked at the 
	formal address, while Kei looked at Borelean with expectation… and perhaps a 
	touch of admiration.<br>
	<br>
	“I don’t command…I ask. Will you help me?” Borelean spoke in a quiet voice. 
	He placed his hand, palm up, on the map table.<br>
	<br>
	Hoshino Kei was first. She placed her delicate hand upon his, and nodded 
	imperceptibly. “Yes, your Highness,” she said.<br>
	<br>
	Adso followed suit. “I’m not doing anything this afternoon… why not raid a 
	cavern of murderous Drudges?” he slyly quipped.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry murmured thoughtfully, “And perhaps with some skilled companions by my 
	side, I’ll actually not visit my lifestone today.” He placed his hand upon 
	the others’ and nodded.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean allowed himself to smile slightly. “Then it’s settled. Let’s 
	prepare our gear.”</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=539">Turbine Site</a>, 
	July 24, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the Release Note for the July event, 
	Intelligent Designs! The strange activities around Dereth continue as the 
	citizens try to figure out the reasons why this behavior is becoming more 
	and more directed. From reports of more Olthoi activity in the north, to the 
	mysteries surrounding the Monouga and why they have been more active lately. 
	There have also been reports of some new activity surrounding the Tanada 
	clan, though nobody is sure if it is related to the other happenings around 
	Dereth. One thing is for sure, some answers need to found soon before it 
	becomes too late to change what is happening. <br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>A change has been made to the servers which should reduce the number 
		of players being booted for Code of Conduct violations. We believe the 
		issue now is being caused by how our servers load balance and how 
		messages can be backlogged and then sent out in a large bunch once that 
		load balancing is complete. The change that was made will basically let 
		the server know that a person is either in portal space or in the 
		process of load balancing and not count those messages against the 
		players message queue. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A new Live Events vendor has been added to the game. When a player 
		participates in a live event, the person running the event will now give 
		out live op tokens that can be given to the new vendor in exchange for 
		the reward of their choosing. These tokens have a pick up timer of 1 per 
		day. We feel that this not only helps to ensure that everyone 
		participating will get a reward, but it also gives the player the choice 
		of what item they want as a reward. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Journal found while running the Following Asheron’s Trail quest 
		is now attuned and bonded and can no longer be given to other players.
		<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Lunnum’s quests are now all separate. This should eliminate any 
		timing issues and will allow player to run the portion of the quest that 
		they desire. Players will still need to complete this series of quests 
		in order the first time. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>All portals in the Colosseum are now unable to be 
		tied/recalled/summoned. This does not include the portal to actually 
		enter the Colosseum staging area. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>An issue with paintings not sorting well when dropped on the floor 
		of a house has been fixed. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>We had received many reports that the Ninja were more difficult to 
		kill as a melee or an archer. Some adjustments were made and they should 
		now be easier to kill for these characters. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A small bug was fixed that was causing any NPC’s with the same setup 
		as the Golems on Asheron’s Island not to turn towards the player 
		interacting with them. They will now turn and face players who try to 
		interact with them. Currently this should only affect the Collector 
		Golem on Bur. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A change has been made to how the Colosseum chests work. The chests 
		will now lock immediately after they are closed. </li>
	</ul>

	Game Discussion/In Concept<br>
	</b><br>
	As a game progresses there comes a time when things that were once deemed as 
	not going to happen, suddenly become the next logical step in the 
	development process. To that end, the team is in the process of exploring 
	several features for Asheron’s Call that follow the natural progression of 
	the game. In the coming months we will begin discussing these ideas with you 
	the players in order to not only let you know what is going on, but to also 
	gather feedback and opinions as we move forward. <br>
	<br>
	The first of these ideas that we have begun the task of exploring is the 
	idea of Armor Set type items appearing in a new tier of loot that can be 
	found within the lines of quests and other timed/limited repeatability 
	content. These items would be used in the same way other sets that are 
	already in the game. As you collect the pieces of your armor set, the 
	bonuses you can receive from the set will increase. The main difference in 
	this case will be that players will be the ability to mix and match things 
	based on what players find from regular questing and repeating some content. 
	As of right now this idea is only in the earliest of stages and still has 
	some time before/and if it actually hits the game.<br>
	<br>
	As we move forward these and other features will be discussed in more 
	detail. We will also have more exciting features to discuss as we move along 
	our planned development and growth of Dereth. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	July and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	July event.</p>
