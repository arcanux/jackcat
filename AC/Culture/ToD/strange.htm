    Ardry opened the front door of his Uncle Aliester's cottage. The smell of 
	brewing tea greeted him as he stepped inside. Sighing in satisfaction, he 
	grabbed a seat by his uncle's desk and set down a pack full of oddities and 
	trinkets he'd acquired in his last scouting expedition. Moments later, 
	Aliester the Loquacious, pre-eminent sage of Dereth, shuffled into the study 
	bearing a tray with two steaming mugs of green tea.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ardry, my boy! Just in time! Come, have a cup of this fine tea that Ben Ten 
	sent me, and we can discuss your latest trove. Big things are afoot in the 
	realm, I can smell it in the air.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry snorted and pulled a sheaf of musty cloth from his pack. &quot;You must be 
	smelling this, Uncle.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The old man's bushy eyebrows shot upward and his eyes widened when he saw 
	the scraps. He took them from Ardry and wrinkled his nose. &quot;Yes, I can see 
	what you mean about the smell... Though it is a familiar smell. Reminds me 
	of my more adventuresome days, when I used to accompany you on your forays 
	into the Sho lands...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;That's the smell of Drudges, Uncle. Cragstone is swarming with the beasts 
	and some of them were carrying these bits of cloth. Eventually I collected 
	enough of them to realize they were all parts of the same larger picture. I 
	think I have a complete set here. I had to kill a lot of Drudges to get 
	them.&quot; He paused and looked his uncle in the eye. &quot;I mean a lot of Drudges.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Aliester let out a high-pitched noise of excitement that sounded 
	suspiciously to Ardry like a girlish squeal of delight. Before he could 
	comment on it, his uncle shoved the pile of cloth back at him. &quot;Drudges are 
	assaulting Cragstone? We must waste no more time, then, my boy! Please, 
	assemble the pieces into their proper order!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry looked over the clutter that packed every available inch of Aliester's 
	desk, and decided to assemble the pieces on the floor. He got up from the 
	chair and sat on the floor, arranging the scraps until he'd re-assembled the 
	whole picture. It was a crudely drawn, brightly colored rendition of Drudges 
	creating havoc around a human settlement, and the depiction of a flaming 
	windmill identified the town as Cragstone.<br>
	<br>
	Hitching up the bottom of his robe, Aliester got up from his own chair and 
	squatted on the floor in front of the picture. He sipped his tea while his 
	eyes roved over the entire piece, tracing significant parts of the image 
	with the index finger of his free hand. Ardry spent more time watching his 
	uncle's eyes, bright with excitement and intrigue, than he did looking at 
	the picture that he'd already examined several times.<br>
	<br>
	When he was done with his inspection, Aliester sat back on his haunches and 
	looked at Ardry. &quot;Well, what do you make of this?&quot; He sipped at his tea as 
	he waited for his nephew's reply.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry shrugged. &quot;Not very useful. It clearly spells out a plan to raid 
	Cragstone. Aside from an unusual degree of coordination and planning among 
	Drudges, I'm not sure what this tells us. They've been the pawns of bigger 
	and smarter creatures for as long as we've known them, so I don't see how 
	this –&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ah, but there is something different here, my boy!&quot; A little tea sloshed 
	out of Aliester's cup as he gesticulated wildly, and it spilled onto Ardry's 
	lap. Ignoring the spill, he pointed at one part of the image.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Look here, Ardry, in the upper left corner. See the lines of purple light 
	coming off this Drudge here? He's clearly some kind of leader among their 
	kind. The purple light must denote some kind of magical power. There is no 
	suggestion of the normal Banderling or Virindi overlords who are usually 
	behind Drudge agitation. A powerful, magic-wielding warlord has risen among 
	the Drudges, it seems.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry shuddered. Drudges were not the most powerful of the humanoid 
	creatures that plagued Dereth, but they were remarkably hard to stamp out 
	and were capable of mustering great numbers when sufficiently motivated. If 
	some warlord was uniting the Drudges of Osteth, they could be a major 
	nuisance to the Aluvian capital city. At the very least, an infestation of 
	Drudges could steal everything that wasn't nailed down, and they'd probably 
	be able to make off with a lot of things that were nailed down, too.<br>
	<br>
	As he considered the possibilities, his uncle spoke again. &quot;It was well you 
	brought this to me when you did, Ardry. You see, the council of sages has 
	recently received reports of unrest among Mosswarts and Banderlings too, in 
	other parts of the realm...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Let me guess. You need me to check it out because all the other scouts are 
	too busy.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;In fact, they are. A great number of them are cooperating to investigate 
	new activity at this graveyard in the Direlands.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So I'm the only one left to get my skull pounded in by Banderling and 
	Mosswart warlords. Got it.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;My dear nephew, your work is a noble service to the realm! And even if 
	other scouts were available, I would have asked you anyway. Who else would 
	have been conscientious enough to gather all the extant pieces of their map? 
	Only you, Ardry, first among the council's scouts. This is why you get the 
	most difficult and unpleasant assignments. Because you are the one we can 
	trust to do the job right!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry could see his uncle's smile was innocent and guileless and that his 
	praise was sincere. He sighed and stood up. &quot;That's a comfort, I suppose. 
	Very well, Uncle, just tell me where the Banderlings and Mosswarts are, and 
	I'll do what you ask.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Aliester clapped his hands together in satisfaction. &quot;Ardry, your dedication 
	should be a lesson to us all.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry snorted. &quot;Yeah, and that lesson is that no good deed goes unpunished.&quot;</p>

	<p>Captain Tharnoch crouched over the shattered corpse of an undead 
	sorcerer, picking through the skeletal remains for anything noteworthy or 
	useful. It was night in Dereth, but moonlight provided enough illumination 
	for an experienced guerilla like Tharnoch to make his way through this 
	ancient and recently re-surfaced graveyard.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Who were you people and why have you awakened from your long sleep?&quot; 
	Tharnoch muttered to the corpse as he rifled its belongings. It was 
	obviously a futile question, as the corpse had been unlikely to answer even 
	when it was still animated. But Tharnoch had gotten into the habit of 
	talking, to himself or to anything else, in the years in the wilderness when 
	he and his small band of Aluvian soldiers had been living on the run from 
	King Varicci's monstrous army. The sound of a human voice was a small 
	defense against the madness that had threatened to engulf them all during 
	those long, bleak years.<br>
	<br>
	The question also came of frustration. He'd spent three days and three 
	nights scouting the graveyard, killing as many of the wandering undead as he 
	dared, searching for some clue that would explain what had brought this 
	graveyard and its buried souls to the surface after thousands of years under 
	the shifting sands of the Direlands. <br>
	<br>
	Just as much of a mystery was the identity of the graveyard's denizens. 
	Earlier scouts had discovered pages from an ancient journal, recollections 
	that named the undead of this area as victims of some great campaign by Lord 
	Rytheran, one of the most powerful of the Dericostian undead who still 
	lingered in Dereth millennia after the crumbling of their empire. These 
	unfortunate souls had once been the nobles and retainers of a house that 
	fled the court of Dericost in the earliest days of the court's undead 
	corruption. Rytheran had hunted down the disloyal house and subjected them 
	to the very perversion of undeath that they had tried to escape.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's a terrible thing, to take away the prospect of a good death,&quot; Tharnoch 
	mused to himself, reflecting again on the strange lifestone-bound undeath 
	that was common to all denizens of Dereth. &quot;I hope this isn't me in a few 
	thousand years...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Finally, under a pile of tattered cloth and leather, Tharnoch's keen eyes 
	detected a glint of metal. Pushing aside the scraps, he turned up a small, 
	charred metal disc. As he brushed away the grave dust, the features of the 
	disc became more evident. It looked like some kind of coin, bearing a mark 
	unfamiliar to his eyes. It put him in mind of other insignia he'd seen in 
	texts about the ancient noble houses of the vanished Empyrean kingdoms. 
	Pleased with his find, and certain that it would help the Council unravel 
	the mystery of the graveyard, he put the coin in his belt pouch.<br>
	<br>
	He intended, at that point, to return to the Council and show them the coin. 
	He got as far as reaching into another belt pouch to withdraw the proper 
	portal gem when he stopped. He felt a chill creeping over him, and the 
	intuition he'd come to rely on during his time as a guerilla leader served 
	him well. He glanced behind him and saw five ghostly figures drifting among 
	the gravestones, headed in his direction. He turned to face them, keeping to 
	a low crouching stance, and readied his sword and shield. They didn't seem 
	to have noticed him yet, but they would if they moved much closer, and he 
	was sure they'd notice him if he tried to run for it.<br>
	<br>
	As Tharnoch waited for the inevitable confrontation, he took the time to 
	study these five ghosts. The figure in the center looked like the leader. It 
	was taller and dressed in a finer cut of robes than its companions. Its 
	ravaged face was too withered to reveal anything about its identity or even 
	its gender, but somehow he formed the impression that it was a female. He 
	tried to memorize as many details as he could, in case he was defeated in 
	this fight and had to give a report without being able to inspect the 
	remains.<br>
	<br>
	The ghosts finally came close enough to take notice of him. As one, five 
	wraithlike heads turned to face him, and the air somehow grew colder. The 
	leader stood back and waved her arms. The other four advanced, hissing, with 
	fell magic crackling from their spectral hands. Tharnoch straightened up, 
	spat on the ground, and braced himself for the fight. &quot;Come on, then!&quot; he 
	growled, waving his sword. &quot;See if you fare any better against me than you 
	did against Rytheran!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	At the mention of that name, the leader of the ghosts fixed her empty eyes 
	on him and let out a shriek of pure, keening rage. Tharnoch roared a war cry 
	and charged forward into the ghostly gauntlet.</p>

	Strange Sightings. This is the first of our new style of Release Notes for 
	the monthly updates. This month we are hoping to get some answers about the 
	strange disappearances happening all over Dereth. Who is behind them and 
	why? <br>
	<br>
	Below we will list some of the new things and improvements to the game for 
	the month of April. Please note that not all of the new content going in to 
	the game will be listed on this page. <br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Graveyard in the Direlands has had some new

		One of these things is Alternate Vendor Currency. This tech allows 
		certain vendors to sell their wares using something other than the 
		traditional currency in game. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Some members of the Council are getting 
		suspicious of Lord Kresovus. You may want to speak to an agent for the 
		council in Cragstone. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">It appears that there are some Banderling 
		troubles near Ayan Baqur. A royal guard stationed there is seeking out 
		some answers. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The rest of the baby creatures have shown up on 
		the landscape. This marks the official beginning of the spring season in 
		Dereth.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Decorative Repugnant Staff presently counts 
		against the number of hookable casting items in the home. It should not 
		do so, as it is not a hookable caster. This has been fixed for the April 
		event. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The rate at which Mushrooms spawn in the Bur

		collect these little fungi.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">An issue with Ulgrim's Drinking Contest, which 
		could cause some players to not get their reward, has been fixed. If for 
		some reason you do not get your reward, simply beating Ulgrim once more 
		will allow you to get the rewards. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The quest Digging in the Shadows (given by 
		Melaverre in Sanamar to Viamontian loyalists) had an issue which would 
		not allow players to repeat the quest. This has been fixed and players

&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">On the Tanada House of Water quest there was an

	<p><span lang="en-us"><b>Game Discussion</b><br>
	During this month we wanted to take the opportunity to speak on some of the 
	recent changes that have gone in to the game. More specifically, this month 
	we are going to look at the decision making behind Asheron's recent armor 
	changes courtesy of Kintani, who was one of the driving forces behind 
	Asheron's new look. Think of this as a sneak peek into the development 
	process that many have never seen. <br>
	<br>
	From the words of Kintani,<br>
	<br>
	<b>Rebuilding Asheron:</b><br>
	<br>
	When it came time to reintroduce Asheron into the world, we decided he 
	needed to show some of the changes that came from his time missing from 
	Dereth. After many discussions, we decided the best way to do this was up 
	update his appearance. What would a being of Asheron's power do, if he went 
	through such an ordeal? Would he feel safe anymore, if he now knew there 
	were forces in the world that could capture and contain him for so long?<br>
	<br>
	We figured some changes were in order, so we looked at several options, and 
	brought in some outside help. First off, we had to decide what direction we 
	wanted to go in. Asheron had been captured by forces known to him, but 
	clearly underestimated if they could hold him for so long. Given that 
	situation, it made logical sense that he would move to increase his own 
	defenses after being freed. Among those changes, creating and wearing armor 
	is a great place to start.<br>
	<br>
	Given Asheron's lineage, it made sense that he would draw on the resources 
	of his late father, Lord Atlan, in designing armor to protect himself. We 
	wanted to keep Asheron looking like Asheron, however, so we decided to 
	create a suit of armor that also suited Asheron's previous choices in 
	appearance. This led to the basic idea of the armored robe. It maintained 
	Asheron's style, while adding in defenses well suited to his present 
	desires. Now that we had a path and an idea, we needed to come up with what 
	it looked like. <br>
	<br>
	To design Asheron's new armored robe, we contracted a very talented artist 
	by the name of Claire Hummel, or &quot;Shoomlah&quot; to those people familiar with 
	her work. She created a robe for Asheron that was a blend of his original 
	robe, and armor pieces styled off of several existing Empyrean armor sets, 
	including the Thaumaturgic Plate and the Auroric Plate armors. With the 
	design set, we set to work rebuilding Asheron for the game world.<br>
	<br>
	Claire created all of the textures used in the present model of Asheron, 
	while I created the 3D objects to use those textures. After a good bit of 
	collaboration and tweaking, the Asheron you now see in home was born.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Producer's Letter</b><br>
	<br>
	Last but certainly not least we are proud to present you with the 2007 
	edition of the Producer's Letter courtesy of our very own beloved Producer 
	Dave &quot;Crowley&quot; Javier. </span></p>
    <hr width="65%">
    <p><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="lttp"></a>2007 Producer's Letter</b> - <font face="Arial" size="1">from the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=527">Turbine Site</a>, 
	April 17, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello from Turbine! It's been a good year for Asheron's Call™, and we're 
	looking forward to more good things in the upcoming year. <br>
	<br>
	Before I discuss our plans for the future, I'd like to review our 
	accomplishments in the last year.<br>
	<br>
	One of the first things we did last year was to fulfill a promise to the PvP 
	community. We rebalanced the damage and mechanics of PvP combat to make 
	fights faster, more lethal, and more exciting. We based our changes on 
	feedback and discussion with PvP players on our boards, and we are pleased 
	with the way things turned out. Now that we feel good about the way PvP 
	combat works, it's time to focus on another way to improve PvP: giving 
	people something to fight over. I'll get back to this issue when I discuss 
	future plans.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to the PvP rebalance, we added a lot of new in-game features 
	over the year, including cast-on-strike weapons, equipment sets, the title 
	panel and expanded powers for monarchs to appoint officers and manage their 
	allegiances. And of course, we completed the massive Throne of Destiny story 
	arc, which started with the Viamontian invasion of Dereth and culminated in 
	the unified efforts of two monarchs, King Varicci II and Queen Elysa, to 
	defeat the threat of the ancient demon Grael. We recently completed a 
	&quot;mini-arc&quot; that sent players to the world of Bur to investigate Asheron's 
	mysterious disappearance from Dereth.<br>
	<br>
	With all the great things that went into the game in the last year, perhaps 
	the most important development happened outside the game. Near the beginning 
	of last year, we made the Asheron's Call client available for download 
	online, through the Turbine store and through arrangements with online file 
	hosts. Now, people who are interested in the game but unable to find copies 
	at their local game store can buy a digital version of the game online. In 
	2007 we plan to even further expand our digital distribution partnerships 
	for Asheron's Call™.<br>
	<br>
	We followed the online distribution of the client with new marketing and 
	advertising initiatives over the course of the year, capping with the launch 
	of a free trial program in the late summer and fall that has infused the 
	game's population with new and returning players. In addition, we recently 
	announced bulk subscription plans, where players can contact Turbine 
	customer service to pre-pay their monthly subscriptions in convenient 
	three-month, six-month, and one-year packages. Watch for our continued 
	marketing initiatives, featuring impressive new artwork, in print and online 
	media.<br>
	<br>
	Obviously it's not just the AC Live team that's been responsible for all of 
	these great initiatives. The marketing, billing, and customer service folks 
	at Turbine have gone above and beyond the call of duty to support Asheron's 
	Call.<br>
	<br>
	So with all that great stuff under our collective belt in the last year, 
	what is the AC team planning to do with the next year? We will, of course, 
	continue to put out compelling content updates and an evolving storyline, 
	but there are three major initiatives we'd like to focus on this year. 
	Please keep in mind that these are our goals, and we cannot make guarantees 
	or set timelines about when you can expect to see them in the game:<br>
	<br>
	<b>Quest Experience</b><br>
	One of the issues nearest and dearest to the hearts of many in our community 
	is frustration with grinding in high-level dungeons or hunting grounds for 
	character advancement. After a lot of impassioned internal discussion and 
	with copious feedback from players, we've decided to increase the amount of 
	experience that players achieve through quest completion. This should allow 
	players to advance at a healthy rate through questing, so that you won't 
	feel like you need to grind Olthoi just to keep competitive. Starting with 
	this year's first content updates, we've increased the amount of experience 
	each quest grants as a reward. For now, this increase affects new content 
	only. As time permits, we will start retrofitting old content to be 
	commensurate with our new standards.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Quest Tracker</b><br>
	A key feature of current MMO's is the quest panel, which allows you to keep 
	track of quest objectives and locations with a single UI panel. We'd like to 
	bring this functionality to Asheron's Call. However, we have over seven 
	years of quests, major and minor, to be updated. Much like the new quest 
	experience guidelines, the quest tracker will only apply to new content at 
	first, and then will gradually be retrofitted onto older content over time.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Elder Game</b><br>
	This is the biggest and potentially the most challenging of our initiatives 
	for the year, but I wanted to announce our intention to start development on 
	an alternate &quot;elder game&quot; mechanic. I may be doing it a disservice by 
	calling it an &quot;elder game&quot; because we do not intend it to be solely for 
	high-level players. Our goal is simply to provide an alternate method for 
	players to compete and have fun, beyond the well-loved traditional 
	activities of questing and hunting. The starting point for our design will 
	be the land control system we had in the works as part of Throne of Destiny, 
	but it will likely change a lot as we develop and refine the system. We 
	don't intend for it to be solely PvP-based, but there will certainly be a 
	PvP component to it. We intend to have a great amount of discussion with 
	you, our players, so that we can tailor our work with community input. <br>
	<br>
	That sounds like a pretty ambitious list, right? We're looking forward to 
	the challenge and we think there's still a lot of great work ahead of us.<br>
	<br>
	So in closing, I'd like to thank all our players, whether you've been with 
	us for seven years or you're in your first month. We cherish the opportunity 
	we have to work on this game and keep providing content for you to enjoy.<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>
