	<b>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 2/15/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=268592#post268592">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hello there everyone. I hope we all had a great weekend. I 
	know it was nice for those of us who still enjoy a good snowstorm, though it 
	did make getting to work on Monday a bit interesting. Let’s get on with this 
	week’s update. <br>
	<br>
	The February event A Change in Tactics is going live this week. As always, 
	we are very excited about this event, and we hope you are as well. All 
	worlds will be down today, Wednesday the 15th, from 9am EST to 3pm EST. That 
	downtime will be a bit longer for the Darktide server so that we can get the 
	promised Hardwar upgrade done for them. Darktide will be down until 5pm EST. 
	We may not need it to be down for that long, but we want to be sure of 
	things before we bring the world back up.<br>
	<br>
	I wanted to take this opportunity to address the recent concerns with 
	language and other CoC violations that have been brought up a lot recently. 
	We have heard you, and we share your concern with the situation. We will be 
	working together with customer service in the coming weeks and months to 
	help improve the way some situations are handled. One of the things we are 
	working on that is related to this is a language filter. This is the first 
	step to help our players as well as helping our support staff with the 
	amount of language calls we receive. The language filter will help in making 
	it so that players who don’t want to read the language, won’t have to. The 
	language filter is not a replacement for enforcement, but it will help allow 
	players who don’t want to be exposed to bad language in the interim. We 
	still want to stop the offending players, and will continue to try and do 
	so, but in the meantime the language filter will certainly help. As always 
	we will be continuing to enforce the CoC and trying to remove those players 
	who feel they are above the rules of the game.<br>
	<br>
	The last thing I will talk about in this post is what we are doing this 
	week, other than shoveling snow. During this week, the final version of the 
	February event is given the ok to be pushed out. QA and Crowley give the OK, 
	and the event is sent to our Ops team so they can prepare the event to get 
	out to everyone. Along with this work, the team is already heavily into the 
	content for March. Finishing up designs and ideas, as well as making sure 
	that the goals we have set for ourselves are met. <br>
	<br>
	That is it for this update. We hope you all have a great week.<br>

	new system will help us answer your questions faster and more efficiently. 
	Your questions can be answered more quickly and you won’t have to wait in a

	we’re very excited to bring this to our players. It’s also much easier to

	<p>Hi there everyone. <br>
	<br>
	I wanted to start off this week’s update with a heart felt thank you. We 
	know that this week has been one that a lot of us would like to just forget, 
	and that many of you feel very strongly that we are not handling the recent 
	downtimes in a correct manner. All I can say is that we are doing all that 
	we can to keep the downtimes to a minimum. When dealing with billing systems 
	that contain as much valuable information as ours does, you need to be 
	extremely careful. If that means having to bring things down several times 
	to make sure things are kept safe, then it is something we will not hesitate 
	to do. We would rather be sure that all the information is safe, than taking 
	a risk just to keep things up a bit longer. I know that some people are 
	asking for the exact details of what has been done that would require us to 
	have things up and down like this, and to be totally honest, most of it is 
	way over my head. What I do know is that everything that was and is being 
	done is to improve not only the performance of the billing and 
	authentication system, but to also make things easier for you, our customers 
	and our own billing staff. So once again thank you for being patient with us 
	while we work through these changes to the billing system. <br>
	<br>
	Moving forward we have some exciting things going in for the March event. I 
	won’t give out too much information right now, but what I will say is that 
	the world of PvP is in for some rather interesting changes. While not 
	getting into the numbers on the changes, I will say that not only are there 
	going to be some damage increases on Weeping Weapons, there will be more 
	improvements on Phantom and Hollow weapons. Not to mention the continued 
	changes that will be made to help loot weapons become more viable in PvP. 
	All the changes we are making are based on the feedback we got from you, the 
	PvP community. The feedback that we have gotten so far has been great, and 
	we hope to be able to continue that dialog going forward. As we get closer 
	to the March event, we will post more on these changes. <br>
	<br>
	This week is implementation and testing for March. This is when the team 
	gets all of the quests into the game and begin the testing process. We will 
	play through the quests, looking for any errors or oddities that nay cause a 
	problem. This is also the time we look at the balance of these quests to 
	make sure they are in line with our goals. <br>
	<br>
	Thank you all very much and have a great day.<br>

	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hello there everyone. I do hope we all had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	Not too long ago we made some changes to the Temples of Enlightenment and 
	Forgetfulness. While we feel that these changes were a step in the right 
	direction, there was room to make some changes. Coming in the March update 
	we have made some tweaks to this system. When you log in after the March 
	update, all players will have their temple timers reset. This means that 
	once again you will be able to make those changes that some of you could not 
	complete before. The first change that has been made is the splitting of the 
	attribute timers. After the first round of changes were made you could pick 
	up 18 attribute tokens, either attributes up or down. This system caused 
	some confusion among some of the players, and some people picked up 18 
	tokens of raise or lower attributes, thinking they could pick up 18 more of 
	the opposite tokens. For the March event, we have separated the timers on 
	the attribute tokens, so that players will now be able to only pick up 9 of 
	each type of attribute token. <br>
	<br>
	Another change that is being made is the ability to correct mistakes once 
	inside the temples. I can remember from my days in customer service, players 
	putting in calls saying they had accidentally picked up the wrong gems. In 
	the March event this will no longer be a problem. If for whatever reason a 
	player picks up the wrong token, they can simply turn that token in to an 
	NPC, and they will then be able to pick up another. This way, those mistakes 
	will no longer be an issue. We have also made sure that the books in the 
	temples have been updated to reflect all of the changes to the system. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team will continue to check out the things going in for the 
	March event. This includes any bugfixes or content revision that may have 
	been suggested after testing. This is one of those weeks where a little bit 
	of everything is being done in preparation for the March event. <br>
	<br>
	I would also like to put out a warning/reminder that with the official 
	launch of DDO this week, we may experience some slowness on the forums. 
	There are a lot of people trying to access our websites and other resources 
	this week, and while we do not foresee any issues with this, we will be 
	monitoring the site for anything that may arise.<br>
	<br>
	That’s it for this week. Everyone have a great day, and good hunting.<br>

    <p><b>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 3/6/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?t=28557">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hi there everyone. I hope that everybody had a great weekend. <br>
	<br>
	Let’s get right into this week’s update.<br>
	<br>
	This week we are doing the final run-throughs for the March update. We are 
	making sure quest difficulties are where we want them and fixing any issues 
	that may have come up in testing. We also have begun the process of ramping 
	up the content for the April event. Doing quest write-ups, making sure the 
	mechanics of the game allow us to do what we want to, throwing ideas back 
	and forth and brainstorming the things we want to do. This tends to be some 
	of the most fun we have. Throwing ideas at each other, which sometimes leads 
	to some of the silliest ideas you might ever hear. I won’t get into details 
	about some of these ideas, but let’s just say you would all be glad they end 
	at being ideas, and don’t actually make it into the game. <br>
	<br>
	Normally in these updates I would be giving you some information about what 
	is coming in the next update, which in case you were wondering is on 
	Wednesday March 15th, and is named Down Twisting Paths. Instead of giving 
	you more information about what is coming in the March event, I thought we 
	could do something different. I want to know what the one thing in AC stands 
	out the most to you as a player. What is that one quest, that one piece of 
	content that makes you sit back and think what a great idea this was? <br>
	<br>
	I have 2 motives for this question, the first being that we can take the 
	feedback from this and use it to help us make things you all feel are more 
	fun. The other motive for this question is to help break up a lot of the 
	negativity that has been floating in the air lately. What better way to do 
	that than to list your favorite thing about Asheron’s Call. When you think 
	of all the fun you have had playing, what is the first thing that stands out 
	in your mind? I know for me it has to be doing the Sword of Lost Light quest 
	for the first time. I can remember my future wife yelling at me to go to bed 
	as it was well past 1am on a weekday, and I had to be to work at 6am. If I 
	recall right, I didn’t actually make it to bed that night, though I did get 
	my sword. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it. The LttP is going to be out on this upcoming Friday, the 
	10th. We will as always keep you informed if there are any changes to this 
	schedule. Everyone have a great day!<br>

    <p><b>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 3/13/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?t=28668">by 
	Frelorn</a>)</p>
	<p>Hi there. Welcome to this weeks update. Let’s get right into it, as this 
	is going to be a busy week.<br>
	<br>
	In case anyone forgot, this is event week. The March event, Down Twisting 
	Paths will be going live on Wednesday, and we are excited about all of the 
	new things going on in Dereth. As with all of our events, we are looking 
	forward to player feedback on the things we have been able to implement this 
	month. <br>
	<br>
	This week I have decided to answer a couple of the bigger questions that 
	have been asked here on the forums.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Will there ever be characters classes who are “tinkerers” or “mule” type 
	characters that can be made special from creation?</b><br>
	As of right now no, however in Dereth we never say never. The tech for 
	making special mule characters is not really in place at the moment. Though 
	it would be nice for something like this, it is not on the radar at the 
	moment, as the team is more focused on more in-game things. <br>
	<br>
	<b>You keep telling us that CD keys will be available soon. When is soon?</b><br>
	Unfortunately as of right now I cannot give you a solid date, I wish I could 
	but there are several factors that come into play when getting this done. 
	The first issue is compatibility. In order to do this one of the first 
	things we needed to do was make a new installer. This new game installer 
	will allow everyone to download the latest version of the game. This will 
	include users of the new Windows OS. Now in order to make sure that these 
	systems all work we need to test the installer several times under many 
	different circumstances. This takes some time to complete. <br>
	<br>
	The next thing we have to do is generate the CD keys themselves and make 
	sure they work with our billing system. After that is done the system for 
	distributing the keys must be tested and retested to make sure that 
	everything is working correctly. After that is done then the secure page for 
	these transactions must be made. After all of that is completed, we test 
	everything again, just to be sure. Then we will be able to release the keys 
	for everyone to purchase and use. This is not a process we are going to rush 
	into without taking the needed steps to make sure everything is secure and 
	working correctly. <br>
	<br>
	That all being said, we are very close to having all of this completed, and 
	as soon as I have a concrete date for when the sales will begin, I will make 
	sure to have announcements everywhere we can put them. On a side note about 
	this, as many have posted, the Turbine store recently ran out of stock of 
	ToD. An order has been placed recently and more copies will be in stock 
	within a week or so. Once the stock has been refilled, all orders will be 
	sent out. <br>
	<br>
	<b>When will we see more live events? </b><br>
	Soon. We have some live events ideas in the works right now. I would like to 
	add that based on feedback from previous events, we will be doing these 
	events 2 ways. One will be a set of scheduled events. The schedule for these 
	events will be posted for everyone to see so players can plan to 
	participate. We will also be running these same types of events randomly, 
	for those who want more of a surprise feel. The decision to do things this 
	way was solely based on the feedback we got from you, the players. This new 
	way of doing things will hopefully allow everyone who wants to participate, 
	the ability to do so. We are looking forward to these events, and as we get 
	closer to them, we will post the schedule. <br>
	<br>
	<b>What’s going on this week?</b><br>
	This week the team has shifted its focus from the March event, and has moved 
	on to April. We have just about completed the testing for March, though QA 
	will still be checking things out until the event goes live. This is the 
	time the team concentrates on getting everything they want to do for April 
	documented and ready to be placed in our internal test world. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. We are all excited about the upcoming event, 
	and we look forward to your feedback. Everyone have a great day, and see you 
	in Dereth!<br>
