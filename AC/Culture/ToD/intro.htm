	<p>
    <span lang="en-us">The air was heavy with smoke and the stench of burned 
	flesh. The smell of slaughter lingered on every blood- and ichor-spattered 
	surface in the underground cavern. A man dressed in gore-encrusted leather 
	armor walked across the cavern floor, which was littered with corpses. A few 
	of the corpses were human, dressed in robes, now sodden with blood and 
	filled with puncture wounds. Most of the corpses were spectacularly inhuman: 
	great tentacled beasts and finned horrors from another realm…<br>
	<br>
	Stepping around one particularly large, tentacled carcass that still stunk 
	of the dark magic that once animated it, the master assassin Oswald found 
	several of his acolytes gathered together around something in a back corner 
	of the cavern. As he grew closer, he could hear a sibilant whispering noise. 
	It seemed his acolytes had managed to capture one alive, after all. He 
	smiled slightly, even as the crowd of acolytes noticed him and parted 
	quickly to reveal their prisoner.<br>
	<br>
	The captive was humanoid in shape, a two-legged, two-armed shambler that 
	walked mostly upright. But its skin was scaly and fouled with slime, and its 
	head was crested with a sharp finned ridge. Goggle-shaped eyes glowered 
	balefully at him, and its wide, fish-like mouth flapped and hissed with pain 
	and rage. Its limbs had been pinned to the ground by the simple expedient of 
	four heavy dirks driven through its flesh and between its major bones. By 
	the creature’s head, one of his acolytes stood by with a blade, ready to 
	dispatch the creature at his command.<br>
	<br>
	Oswald looked up and met the eyes of one of the other acolytes assembled 
	here, a young woman whose cockiness was evident in the set of her arms as 
	she watched her Master approach. “Sabithra,” Oswald said to her, “report 
	now.”<br>
	<br>
	The woman grinned and bowed with exaggerated deference. “We managed to bring 
	this one down alive, Master. As you told us, it is different from the other 
	Moarsmen that we’re most familiar with, but it does seem, in its powers and 
	its inclinations and its… smell… to be similar to the new colonies of these 
	creatures that have appeared on shores around Dereth. First near Ayan Baqur, 
	then Tou-Tou, and – “<br>
	<br>
	Oswald held up a hand. “Enough. I’ve reviewed the scouts’ reports. I know 
	where these things have crawled ashore.” He paused to listen to the noises 
	the creature was making. “Have any of you been able to understand what it’s 
	been saying? Have you been able to divine which of the Matriarchs this one 
	serves?”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra shook her head. “Unintelligible to all of us, Master. It doesn’t 
	seem to recognize any of the Matriarch names you taught us. At least, it 
	didn’t seem particularly reverent or respectful of any of them. Just seemed 
	to get more and more angry when we repeated those names.”<br>
	<br>
	Oswald nodded. “As I expected. Give me some room.” He made a gesture, and 
	the acolytes all took a step back as their Master approached to squat near 
	the creature. They watched in fascination as their Master looked into the 
	creature’s eyes and muttered something harsh and guttural.<br>
	<br>
	The creature’s eyes, which were beginning to dim from pain and blood loss, 
	snapped back open, alight with surprise and anger. A torrent of gibberish 
	spilled forth from the creature’s mouth, and more blood and ichor spattered 
	on their Master’s armor. A gob of slime hit their master in the face, which 
	he wiped away with calm dignity. He continued to speak to the creature in 
	its own language, and the beast grew even more animated. The acolytes all 
	watched in dumb incomprehension.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, Oswald seemed to ask the creature a question. The creature’s 
	response was a croak of what seemed like malevolent laughter, and a word 
	that sounded like “T’thuun” seemed to issue from its lips several times as 
	it responded to the question.<br>
	<br>
	Sighing, Oswald drew a handkerchief from within his armor and wiped off his 
	hands and face. He stood up and looked back over the rest of the cavern, 
	where more of his acolytes were dutifully dripping lamp oil over the rest of 
	the corpses. He nodded to the acolyte standing ready with the sword, then 
	stepped back. The acolyte nodded and brought the sword down in a smooth arc 
	that severed the creature’s bulbous head from its body. Blood and gore 
	fountained from the neck-hole and showered the sword-wielding acolyte and 
	Sabithra with more pungent ichor. Sabithra cursed and stepped back, flicking 
	pieces of viscera from her armor.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Oswald indulged himself with a small smile at Sabithra’s displeasure before 
	he tossed the handkerchief to her. “Clean your hands off,” he said to her. 
	“Now, are you carrying parchment and a pen like I asked you to?”<br>
	<br>
	Gritting her teeth, Sabithra nodded. “I am, Master.”<br>
	<br>
	Oswald nodded and smiled at her. “Very good. Now, retrieve them from your 
	pack and get ready to take dictation.”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra almost dropped the handkerchief. “Dictation, Master? I don’t 
	understand.”<br>
	<br>
	“Dictation, my quick-learning acolyte, means I will speak out loud, and you 
	will write my words down on paper. Then, we will roll up the paper, and send 
	it to someone as a letter. Make sure you write neatly. These hoary old 
	nobles do value good penmanship. More to the point, I’m sure that they’re 
	going to want to hear all about recent developments among the Falatacot. 
	Perhaps that old fool will even be able to tell me why these creatures have 
	found something to worship in place of the old Matriarchs. It’s the least he 
	can do, with all the time I’ve spent cleaning up his mess.”<br>
	<br>
	“I…” Sabithra looked into Oswald’s eyes and decided not to push her Master’s 
	patience. “As you say, Master.” She finished wiping her hands off, then 
	retrieved a sheaf of parchment and a quill from her pack. She sat near 
	Oswald, braced the paper on top of her pack, wet the pen in a small bottle 
	of ink, and made ready to take dictation.<br>
	<br>
	“Wonderful,” Oswald said approvingly. “I’ll start the dictation now. ‘To 
	Lord Rytheran of Menilesh…’”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra tried to contain her own look of surprise as she began to write.</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Rytheran sat in his 
	most recently constructed sanctum, his journal open before him to a blank 
	page. The proud Lord of Menilesh, once the most favored noble of the Eternal 
	Court of Dericost, slouched in a most undignified fashion in his hard stone 
	throne. All around him, his servants silently carried on their tasks, 
	engaged in research and minor magical experiments, while he himself brooded 
	over the empty journal, staring at the white parchment with empty eyes. He 
	thought about mistakes and miscalculations that dated back millennia – to 
	memories that seemed more like dreams to him now, perhaps stories that he 
	had once been told. He thought about the very real problems those mistakes 
	had created for him now, in an age he could never have foreseen and in a 
	situation he never wanted to be a part of.<br>
	<br>
	His thoughts were interrupted by his Steward, who entered the room, dodged 
	past a few scurrying acolytes, and took up a position just to his side, 
	obviously waiting to be acknowledged and unwilling to speak or touch his 
	master in order to receive such acknowledgement.<br>
	<br>
	Rytheran let him stand there for a few moments before he turned to look at 
	the Steward. He then noticed the rolled-up parchment in the Steward’s hand, 
	and asked him with a flat voice, “What news do you bring?”<br>
	<br>
	The Steward bowed deeply, almost abjectly, and presented the letter. “A 
	thousand pardons for interrupting your, ah, contemplation, my lord. This 
	missive was brought by… a mortal. An Isparian.”<br>
	<br>
	Rytheran’s interest piqued, as much from interest as irritation. It bothered 
	his ancient pride to even have to treat with the lesser races that had 
	stumbled into a land his people once claimed for their own. Still…<br>
	<br>
	“What sort of Isparian?” he asked. “One of the little slave-queen’s 
	servants? The witch’s? The assassin’s? Some other pawn of the Yalain?”<br>
	<br>
	“From the messenger’s dress and… methods of ingress, I believe this missive 
	comes from the assassin. The seal would seem to indicate that as well.”<br>
	<br>
	Rytheran took the letter and looked at the seal. The deep red wax indeed 
	bore a familiar sigil. He straightened up in his seat and raised his head to 
	look around the room and announced, “I will be alone now.” With little delay 
	and in almost total silence, the room full of servants and acolytes set down 
	what they were doing and shuffled dutifully from the chamber, shepherded out 
	by the ever-servile Steward. The Steward himself was the last to leave, and 
	closed the door softly behind him.<br>
	<br>
	Sighing with all the weariness of a hundred dusty centuries, Rytheran broke 
	the seal and looked at the letter. He sneered to see that the text was in 
	the primitive characters of the Isparian alphabet, and knew this to be a 
	deliberate insult. He held the parchment in his right hand while 
	absent-mindedly tapping an ancient, half-forgotten song with the fingers of 
	his left hand. Gradually, his fingers stopped tapping, and clenched into a 
	fist. When he got to the end of the letter and the sign-off from his 
	correspondent, he raised his fist and slammed it down onto the granite 
	surface of his desktop. <br>
	<br>
	The whole table shuddered from the force of the blow. Cracks spread out from 
	his fist in a spiderweb pattern. A nearby candlestick swayed, and an ancient 
	vase fell from its mount and shattered on the stone floor. Rytheran stood up 
	from his throne, balled up the letter, and threw it into a corner of the 
	room.<br>
	<br>
	There was the sound of running footsteps from outside. The door opened 
	slowly as the Steward hesitantly poked his head back into the room, 
	expecting to have to duck a magical bolt, or at least a thrown lamp. He was 
	relieved to find his master merely pacing the room in agitation. “Is all 
	well, my lord? Is there something you would have of me?”<br>
	<br>
	Rytheran stopped pacing and turned to address his Steward with a calm voice. 
	“Open the pathway to Bur. Bring me a scribe and a messenger. An expendable 
	messenger. When they see what I have to say, when they find out what has 
	happened to their followers on this world, those treacherous old crones will 
	undoubtedly want to sacrifice someone.”</font></span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello there and welcome to the May 2008 Release notes! 
	Lets see what is new and exciting in Dereth this month. <br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b><br>
	As a way of saying thank you to our players for their understanding while we 
	worked through our server issues a couple months back, we will be offering 
	each player a choice of reward items. When players log in to the game after 
	the May event goes live, they will be able to speak to an NPC who will give 
	them a token they can use to choose one of several special items. The items 
	players can choose from are:<br>
	<br>
	1. One free level. If a player who is level 275 accidentally chooses this 
	reward, the will get their token back to choose another item. <br>
	<br>
	2. Aerbax Pack Doll<br>
	<br>
	3. One 25 use key to golden chest at one of the three casinos. For this 
	event we have slightly increased the luck on the Casino chests. <br>
	<br>
	4. One foolproof bag of one of the following salvage types</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Aquamarine</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Black Garnet</span></li>

		<li><span lang="en-us">Zircon</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">5. 20 Enhanced Health Elixirs (200 
	health) There is a 5 minute cooldown on the use of each potion. <br>
	<br>
	6. 20 Enhanced Mana Elixir (200 mana) There is a 5 minute cooldown on the 
	use of each potion.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Locked fellowships will now transfer leadership to the next in line when the 
	leader drops so that the leader can be re-invited. There will only be a 15 
	minute window in which this option is viable. So if after 15 minutes, the 
	leader has not returned, they will not be able to be re-invited to the 
	fellowship. This fix also resolves the issue of players not being able to 
	rejoin a fellowship after being dropped more than once. <br>
	<br>
	Hoshino Kei is no longer in two places at once. <br>
	<br>
	Based on player feedback, we have gone through current spells in the game to 
	ensure that spells are not overwriting each other improperly. <br>
	<br>
	The reward NPC for the Burun Kings quests and the Deep no longer give out 
	title tokens. They will now just give players the title, rather than the 
	token. <br>
	<br>
	Due to technical reasons, any Dark scarabs that players have when the worlds 
	come down for the May event, will be gone when the worlds come back up. We 
	apologize for any inconvenience this may cause players. <br>
	<br>
	The invoker quest and the Burun Kings quest have both had their XP rewards 
	updated to higher amounts. <br>
	<br>
	Items with Cooldown timers now have a visible countdown on their icon. This 
	should allow players to more easily tell when an item is ready to be used 
	again. <br>
	<br>
	Graveyard Wisps now show their correct level to better reflect the 
	difficulty of fighting them. <br>
	<br>
	Some strange new forts have appeared in the waters around Dereth. Players 
	may want to investigate these strange structures. </span>
