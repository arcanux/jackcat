    <p><b><a name="2"></a>Weekly Update 1/8/07 - January 8, 2006 </b>(<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=327115#post327115">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<br>
	<br>
	Hello there and welcome to the January 8th edition of the weekly update!<br>
	<br>
	I know it has been a couple of weeks since the last update was posted, so I 
	am going to try and cram as much information as I can in to this weeks 
	update. <br>
	<br>
	During the last week I have been busy trying to catch up on all the things I 
	missed over the Holiday vacation. One thing we did discuss on my return was 
	gathering more feedback from players here on the forums and in-game. A fine 
	example of this feedback in action is the thread on returning the Caul to 
	its previous XP yield. Just so we are clear, for the time being we are just 
	talking about the creatures in the area known as Caulcano. Creatures outside 
	of this area were not touched when the XP amounts were lowered. <br>
	<br>
	The January event <i><b>Bridging the Vast Divide</b></i> is tentatively 
	scheduled to go live on Tuesday January 16th. As always the date can change 
	if there are any unforeseen issues. We will of course give as much notice as 
	possible if that were to be the case. <br>
	<br>
	In the past, players have stated that they would like schedules of our 
	story-related live-ops. To this end, we wanted to let you know that we do 
	have a story live-op in the works for our January update. We will be posting 
	a schedule of the live-ops in conjunction with the Letter to the Players. We 
	hope that you will be attend, and look forward to seeing you in Dereth!<br>
	<br>
	As some of you may have noticed, we have fixed the errors on the launcher 
	that became evident to those using IE7. The actual issue was that some 
	different coding had to be done when everyone was using IE6 in order to make 
	things look right. This code was actually throwing me off a bit because; for 
	the most part it did look correct. After several posts on the issue I made 
	some quick changes to the old page, which as far as I can tell has fixed the 
	problems people were having. We are still going to have a new page made at 
	some point in the future.<br>
	<br>
	A reminder that on January 19th our beloved Producer, Crowley will be 
	attending a special dinner in the beautiful Pacific Northwest! The will be 
	fun and prizes, as well as the chance to meet and hang with the man behind 
	the scenes of Asheron’s Call. If you are going to be in the Bellevue 
	Washington area and you would like to attend make sure to RSVP
	<a href="mailto:john@dilley.com">john@dilley.com</a>. Having had the 
	opportunity to attend one of these dinners myself, I can say they are really 
	a lot of fun. Make sure you go if you have the chance. <br>
	<br>
	Based on some recent feedback and wanting to keep things going in the right 
	direction as we go forward. We would like to take the opportunity once again 
	to solicit some feedback from you, the players about the last story arc 
	involving Grael. What about the Arc did you like? What about the Arc did you 
	not like? Please keep all responses constructive in nature. Just telling us 
	you did not like it, is not what we are looking for. We want to know exactly 
	what aspects of the event you did like as well what you may not have liked. 
	The more information we can gather, the better. We want to make sure that 
	moving ahead we make the events as strong as we can. Your feedback is an 
	important part of that process.<br>
	<br>
	Some of you have already noticed but, AC along with a few other games has 
	been featured in this month’s Massive Magazine. That goes along with another 
	back cover advertisement. Make sure to check it out if you get the chance.
	<br>
	<br>
	Well that’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

    <p><b><a name="20"></a>Weekly Update 1/15/07 - January 15, 2006 </b>(<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?t=32811">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hello there and welcome to the January 15th edition of the 
	weekly update!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	As most of you know by now, Tuesday January 16th is patch day. So remember 
	that all worlds will be down from 8am EST – 3pm EST for the update. <br>
	<br>
	Crowley, who has been on vacation, sort of, will be attending an Asheron’s 
	Call dinner for all those located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest on the 
	19th of this month. If you can go, make sure you harass him as much as 
	possible.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="Wink" alt="" src="cold/wink.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	During the last week, we have been having a lot of discussions about 
	storylines and what we want to happen in the coming months. The feedback we 
	have gotten from last week’s update has been great to read. We would like to 
	thank everyone who has taken the time to give us that feedback. Our goal is 
	as always to provide our players with the best content and stories that we 
	possibly can. Getting the feedback we have so far is going to be a good way 
	for us to make sure we deliver on that goal. So, thanks again for the great 
	feedback. <br>
	<br>
	With the January event being all set to go this week, the team has shifted 
	gears to getting things done for the February event. This means getting 
	things documented, implemented on our internal servers and getting into 
	balancing things. I know it’s still early, but from what I have seen so far, 
	February is already looking like it is going to be a fun month. <br>
	<br>
	At this point there is not much else going on right now, so I will take this 
	opportunity to answer a couple of questions that are looking at us from the 
	front page of the forums. <br>
	<br>
	Is it possible to change my characters to another server?<br>
	At this time it is not possible. Not too long ago we had a very serious 
	internal discussion about being able to do this as a service to our 
	customers. After some research we found that without a lot of back end work 
	on the game code and how information is stored of the server, this process 
	would be very difficult to do on a large scale. Hopefully with some of the 
	changes we would like to make over the coming year, this will become a 
	possibility, but as of right now, this is something we just cannot do. <br>
	<br>
	New sounds?<br>
	We would love to add some new sounds to the game. Right now the team has 
	other priorities as far as what is getting done, but I would not rule out 
	some new sounds at some point. As far as the weather stuff that came along 
	with this question, we can certainly inquire about putting it back in with a 
	toggle of some sort. Though I know that Severlin already has a ton on his 
	plate right now, but what’s one more thing? <br>
	<br>
	Rares<br>
	As someone in the thread on this topic already said, they are called Rares 
	for a reason. The higher tier rares were never meant to be found by 
	everyone, while the lower tiers were meant to be a bit more common. With 
	that in mind we have been discussing the system as a whole and the 
	possibility of turning up some of the rates on the different tiers of rares. 
	When we have more information about what, if any changes we are going make 
	to the system, we will make sure to let everyone know. <br>
	<br>
	Well that’s about it for now. Everyone have a great week and see you in 
	Dereth! <br>
	<br>
	Oh yea, one more thing before we forget… <br>
	<br>
	GO PATS!!! (Sorry had to do it.)<br>
