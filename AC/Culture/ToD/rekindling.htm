	<p>
    Change had once more arrived in the settlement of Kor-Gursha, borne through 
	the currents of portal space. As Tmauruk sauntered into his home village, he 
	absorbed the new sights and sounds of these warriors, these 'Derethians'. 
	Tmauruk enjoyed watching the new folk - he had always embraced change more 
	readily than his fellows. That was one reason, perhaps, that he'd fallen in 
	with the brothers Morgluuk and Torgluuk in the first place. Certainly, 
	becoming part of their movement had inspired more change in the Ruuk than 
	anything else in Tmauruk's life. <br>
	<br>
	He regretted not passing through the portal to the new world that had been 
	found two years ago, as had Morgluuk, Torgluuk, and many of this tribe. He 
	had remained behind to help the less-experienced tribesfolk in case the 
	Kukuur attacked, and ever since he had felt trapped - not just in the 
	literal sense that this cavern complex was isolated from the surface after a 
	recent earthquake, but also in the figurative sense that he felt too 
	responsible for the well-being of the younger Burun, especially the other 
	scouts who looked up to him for advice and leadership. Solitary by nature, 
	Tmauruk seized every opportunity to go off alone and scout for some new 
	cavern, or perhaps a way to the surface.<br>
	<br>
	As he walked into a high-arched natural vault, one of the most central 
	caverns of the settlement, Tmauruk raised his webbed hand in greeting to 
	Rheegur. The green-skinned Ruuk's mucor-induced powers of recall were second 
	only to Torgluuk's, and he was so well respected that he had been titled 
	'The Memory of Kor-Gursha. &quot;Jurukka, friend!&quot; Tmauruk called to his mystic 
	associate, his boisterous greeting belying his subtle bearing, &quot;What is this 
	all this bustle?&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Rheegur grinned broadly at the black-skinned Ruuk. &quot;Many changes, friend. 
	More humans like Dobblar have come from that far-away world. They seek the 
	one called Asheron,&quot; the Memory of Kor-Gursha replied. Almost as an 
	afterthought, Rheegur added, &quot;Go find Gruuk'lar and Drogur. They have a 
	mission for you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk nodded in assent. He raised his hand in farewell to Rheegur and 
	began to follow the faintly-glowing corridor toward the large cavern from 
	which Gruuk'lar and his fellow guardians and hunters most often kept watch 
	over the townsfolk. Tmauruk's thoughts, however, were not on the squirming 
	mushroom in his hand, but rather on the past... on change.<br>
	<br>
	Before this new wave of Derethians, the last great wave of change had been 
	when Torgluuk had returned in the company of one named Asheron – tall and of 
	the same aspect as the Fiazhat gods, yet not allied with them at all, not 
	possessed of the same cruel nature. He and a 'follower' named Dobblar 
	(although, by Tmauruk's estimation, Dobblar had little to do with Asheron) 
	had come to seek a solution to the strife between the Burun and the varied 
	inhabitants of the land beyond the portal, a land known as Dereth. However, 
	Asheron and Torgluuk had decided to seek out the veins of the world... what 
	Asheron called a 'ley line'. They never returned from that expedition, and 
	even Tmauruk had not been able to track them.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk entered the hunters' cavern and strode toward Gruuk'lar, who was 
	just finishing a conversation with one of the Derethians. &quot;Jurukka, 
	Gruuk'lar. You have something for me?&quot; he asked the village guardian.<br>
	<br>
	Gruuk'lar nodded in assent. &quot;I have been in communication with one of these 
	Derethians, a tracker named Hasin Lin,&quot; he replied, &quot;Lin, in turn works for 
	someone else that he would not name, but Lin was able to give important 
	information about the notes and medallions that the other Derethians are 
	finding for us. Lin knew a small ritual which, when combined with our 
	knowledge of the area, helped us find Torgluuk's location. Drogur and I have 
	agreed that you are the one who is best suited to explore the place Torgluuk 
	is imprisoned. Will you do this?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I will do this.&quot; answered Tmauruk simply, although inside his mind boiled 
	over with the impetuous thoughts of one who embraces change and enjoys a 
	challenge.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Jukuur grau, Tmauruk. We shall see you afterward,&quot; Gruuk'lar intoned 
	ritualistically, handing Tmauruk a small skin with some information written 
	upon it.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk simply nodded his head and hurried away to prepare for his new 
	mission. He already had in mind how he was going to approach this place. He 
	knew of a dangerous path through the underground labyrinth of caverns around 
	Kor-Gursha to the hidden entrance referenced in the note – dangerous, but 
	certainly approachable. However, to sneak past those terrible, powerful 
	beings that the Fiazhat had called gods...<br>
	<br>
	... he just hoped that this latest wave of change didn't kill him<br>

	February 20, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>It had taken Tmauruk all of his skill to sneak as far as he had into the 
	lair of the Fiazhat gods. While the dark ones were inattentive once the 
	canny Ruuk had penetrated their outer perimeter, the sheer number of 
	Falatacot, Sclavus, and even Guruk who roved the halls on various errands 
	caused Tmauruk no account of trouble. Twice he had almost been noticed, but 
	in one instance he'd been able to throw a rock which distracted a passing 
	Guruk, and in the other the Falatacot matriarch had decided that she was 
	above investigating strange sounds in a hall.<br>
	<br>
	His stealth had yielded results, however. He had been fortunate enough to 
	overhear a conversation between a Falatacot and her Sclavus servant. The 
	Falatacot had kept referring to how important it was to guard something in a 
	cavern below their current location, and how it must be kept safe from any 
	incursions from the newcomers - no doubt a reference to the Derethians. Most 
	importantly, however, the Falatacot had mentioned that there were two 
	statues of importance - one to the north, and one to the south. What each 
	statue did, however, he had not yet learned.<br>
	<br>
	He passed room after room containing hoards of treasure and other goods. 
	While he had recently become aware of the worth of the items in those 
	reliquaries, he had a more important task to accomplish. Besides, he dared 
	not remain still for too long - all those Falatacot and servants were bound 
	to stumble upon him if he stopped to loot. Treasure would have to wait for 
	another raid, or perhaps another raider.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk decided to go to the northern statue first. He poked his head into a 
	small greenish room with two sarcophagi on opposite walls. An eerie red 
	light cast shadows over the room. At the end of the room stood a large 
	granite statue carved in the Falatacot style, its face grim and menacing. 
	Tmauruk circumvented a chest that sat in the middle of the room and 
	approached the statue.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk knew, from listening to the conversation in the hall, that the 
	statue could be activated to transport the user somewhere. Moreover, he had 
	heard from many of the 'Derethians' that simply touching such statue often 
	transported the user to a new place. He reached out to the statue, braced 
	himself to be transported, and...<br>
	<br>
	...nothing happened.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk did not know what to do. He did not know how to operate these 
	strange Falatacot devices, nor was he sage enough to divine how to operate 
	them. He prodded at the statue. He examined the eyes and the hands for 
	triggers. He spoke a variety of words at it. Still, the statue daunted him 
	with its stony stillness.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, his patience gone, he focused his anger and rage upon the obstinate 
	statue and smashed his black hand into it. As his hand touched the cool 
	stone, it immediately warmed, and the eyes of the statue began to glow a 
	deep red. He felt himself being drawn into the purple void called portal 
	space, spiraling and unable to control himself.<br>
	<br>
	After a moment of this spinning sensation, Tmauruk landed roughly on a stone 
	floor very unlike the polished architecture of the Falatacot. He stood up 
	slowly and looked around, still shaky on his feet, at a plain stone cavern.
	<br>
	<br>
	Somehow, he decided, his anger had somehow been the key to activating the 
	statue<br>
	<br>
	- a brutal key designed by a harsh people. Resolving to avoid any more 
	interaction with those harsh, dark people than was necessary, Tmauruk slowly 
	crept his way down the tunnel.<br>
	<br>
	He slunk through the caverns, once again avoiding the Falatacot and their 
	minions. He saw Sclavus and Guruk standing side by side as guardians - 
	unthinkable, if he had not seen it himself. Yet the Falatacot had yoked both 
	the mutated Fiazhat snake beings to servitude with no compassion, and the 
	Guruk dared not resist, perhaps in fear of being changed in the same way. 
	The Falatacot truly wielded their power with a cruel and constricting grip.<br>
	<br>
	As he rounded a corner leading into a large cavern, a bright light blinded 
	Tmauruk. He tilted his head down, so he would not be directly looking at the 
	bright object. Suddenly he tucked his head down and rolled into the chamber, 
	barely aware through his other senses that something was trying to assault 
	him with its mighty fists.<br>
	<br>
	The agile vagabond quickly regained his feet and, his back now to the glow, 
	turned to look at his opponent. He kept looking up...and up...and up, until 
	he finally saw its head. While its body seemed amorphously crystalline, an 
	opaque blue fluid flowed around it, occasionally splashing on and scorching 
	the floor of the cavern with a hiss. Tmauruk recognized the form of the 
	infused blood golems which roamed the halls, but those golems contained the 
	red blood that the 'Derethians' shed, not this blue substance...<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk's thoughts were interrupted by the fight, and he instinctively 
	dodged out of the way of the golem's mighty swing. As his momentum carried 
	him away from the blow, he stumbled upon a rocky outcropping. Lying sprawled 
	on the floor, he tried to spring up, but knew that it would be far too late 
	to avoid the next blow of his opponent...<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Directive to all servitors: Damage the ley line in order to lower the mana 
	barrier and free Lord Asheron,&quot; echoed through the chambers, interrupting 
	the fight. Tmauruk sat up to perceive many diamond-like beings marching into 
	the chamber. They were shaped very much like the form of the stranger 
	Asheron. <br>
	<br>
	Their crystalline bodies refracted the light of the chamber into thousands 
	of little rainbows that sparkled over every rock and patch of dirt. Each 
	golem had a symbol on its chest - the Eye (what the 'Derethians' called a 
	sun) superimposed on two moons. They moved in unison, with purpose - an army 
	on the march, ready to overcome whatever obstacles came before them. Tmauruk 
	would not have wanted to engage any single one in combat, never mind a whole 
	tribe of them.<br>
	<br>
	The gigantic blood golem turned to confront its new adversaries with no 
	hesitation. Tmauruk took advantage of its distraction to scurry to what 
	little shadow was present in the cavern and hopefully evade the interest of 
	any of the titans involved in this fight. Safely ensconced, he observed the 
	battle with a scout's attentive eye to detail.<br>
	<br>
	The first blow was struck by the diamond golems. One reared back with an 
	elegantly carved fist and delivered a powerful punch. Shards of crystal 
	splintered from the blood golem, but the dripping blue substance kept its 
	shape. <br>
	<br>
	The diamond golem did not even pull its arm back, assuming that the blow 
	should have destroyed its opponent, allowing the blood golem to retaliate.<br>
	<br>
	The blood golem swung its huge, clubbing fist at the diamond golem which had 
	hit it. Although the fist looked like it should be less deadly against 
	diamond than against Burun flesh, its impact blasted a huge chunk out of the 
	servitor, which collapsed to the ground in an utterly ruined heap.<br>
	<br>
	The blue giant turned its attention to the next diamond golem, and this time 
	thrust both arms out at its enemy. The sparkling automaton could only wave 
	its own arms and legs helplessly as its fluid opponent picked it up bodily 
	and hurled it at the wall, crushing the servitor and shaking the chamber. 
	The blue blood golem battered and destroyed its foes one after another, its 
	arms dealing untold amounts of damage with each earth-shattering impact.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk suddenly heard the deep rumble of stone grinding against stone, a 
	sound he had heard a few times before. &quot;An earthquake!&quot; he quickly muttered 
	to himself. He sprinted toward the entrance of the cavern. At the mouth of 
	the cavern, he turned back to look, despite the blinding light.<br>
	<br>
	The giant had dispatched all but one of its foes. The last diamond golem 
	kept saying the same thing, over and over; &quot;Directive to all servitors: 
	Damage the ley line in order to lower the mana barrier.&quot; It was clear, 
	however, that the directive would remain unfulfilled; this huge creation had 
	apparently been enchanted to fight these diamond golems, perhaps in 
	anticipation of some assault by these servants of Asheron.<br>
	<br>
	As Tmauruk reflected upon this, two things happened. The blood golem snapped 
	the head off of its last foe, and began to look around its cavern for that 
	one last being it had been trying to kill. At the same time, the cavern 
	shook again, spraying rock everywhere. The crafty scout looked up, and 
	narrowly dodged a falling stalactite.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk knew he could not stay there. He began to retreat the way he had 
	entered, but as he did so, he noticed that another piece of the stony 
	ceiling was coming loose above him. He only had one chance - he grasped 
	quickly at a pouch on his belt. Inside, he touched a small purple gem and 
	focused his will on it as he crushed it to dust. As the ceiling pluumeted 
	toward him, he felt once again pulled into portal space.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk looked around. Rheegur stood over him, grinning manically as usual.
	<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Used it, did you?&quot; he asked, cackling a little.<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk nodded as he regained his feet. &quot;Yes, it worked. I had no choice. I 
	am surprised it worked, but it seems safe,&quot; he replied wearily.<br>
	<br>
	Rheegur returned the nod and said, &quot;It may take time, but I will make more, 
	then. Not yet. But soon.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tmauruk nodded and said nothing else. Instead, he began his plodding trek 
	toward Gruuk'lar. He had much to report, and much on his mind. &quot;If only 
	Torgluuk were here,&quot; he thought, &quot;He would know what to do.&quot;</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=516">Turbine Site</a>, 
	February 20, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p><b>New Content and Functionality</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>The Colosseum. </b><br>
		This is pretty much what it sounds like. The Colosseum is a dungeon of 
		sorts with repeatable content. The premise is very simple. Players will 
		enter the Colosseum and fight their way through increasingly difficult 
		stages. There is no timer on repeating, so players will be able to enter 
		The Colosseum as often as they would like, as long as their initial 60 
		minute timer is up. <br>
		<br>
		Players of any level will be able to participate, but The Colosseum is 
		geared towards fellowships. In order to go through, you must be part of 
		a fellowship. When players enter, they will be in a staging area which 
		will be used by everyone. This is a great place to get your fellowships 
		together, or to find a group to tag along with. Once in a fellowship, 
		one person will need to purchase a ticket at a reasonable cost from a 
		nearby NPC. That person will then give the ticket to the starter NPC who 
		will lock the fellowship and let them know they can enter The Colosseum.
		<br>
		<br>
		The initial download time upon entering is a bit longer than most 
		places. The drop is not hot so players are safe upon entrance and should 
		only have to go through this download once. Once you hand in your 
		ticket, your fellowship will have 1 hour to finish the Arena from the 
		time that they start. After this time is up they will all be teleported 
		out of the arena and will be able to speak to the NPC to get their 
		reward. The rewards will depend on how far the fellowship has made it in 
		The Colosseum. If you die in the arena you will be able to re-enter 
		through the first door and then go through all the doors that you have 
		passed through, they will remain open and the creatures will remain dead 
		in previous stages as long as you are within the 1 hour time limit 
		allotted to your fellowship. We have made The Colosseum an area in the 
		game where you will not drop death items, due to very high possibility 
		of people not being able to recover their corpses. <br>
		<br>
		There will be 5 branches of The Colosseum so 5 fellowships full of 
		players may do The Colosseum every hour. Once a fellowship is inside a 
		branch of The Colosseum, that branch is locked from letting other 
		players in. In the coming months we have plans to further update The 
		Colosseum with things such as Boss fights, which can be unlocked by 
		completing various stages in The Colosseum. We have also made it 
		possible for higher level players to skip the first few low levels if 
		they so choose.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b>Squelch Panel</b><br>
		The Squelch Panel has been added to the game. Players will be able to 
		locate the Squelch Panel on their social tab. In order to add a player 
		to your squelch list, simply add the players name to the space provided 
		in the panel and hit the Squelch Character button. If you want to 
		squelch the account associated with that character, just hit the squelch 
		account button after putting the character name in the space provided. 
		The display will tell players if it is an account or character squelch.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b>Craft Buffing Pets</b><br>
		Craft Buffing Pets have been added to the game. These pets will provide 
		buffs to Cooking, Alchemy, Fletching, and Lockpick. These buffs are 
		stackable with all other similar spells. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li><b>NPC Interactions</b><br>
		Once again the team has been hard at work trying to discover ways we can 
		continue to improve the tech and functionality of Asheron's Call. One of 
		the things that is being developed is the ability for NPC's to determine 
		what a player has in their packs. For example, if Player A has 10 
		diamond powders in their pack and they talk to a certain NPC, that NPC 
		will be able to see that and decide what message to send to Player A. 
		This will give us the ability to start offering questing choices. So a 
		player who has a particular item or items in their pack may get a 
		different response then the player next to him who doesn't. While this 
		may not seem overly exciting, it will give us the opportunity to do some 
		things with player, NPC interactions that we had not been able to do in 
		the past. </li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Miscellaneous Changes and Improvements</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The Pallid and Squallid Moars were not able to be hit by melee 
		attacks. This has been fixed and these creatures can now be hit by our 
		melee friends<br>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=513">Turbine Site</a>, 
	February 16, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the February 2007 Letter to the Players. The 
	people of Dereth have been diligent in their search for Asheron. A new 
	fighting area has been discovered. Will anyone be able to discover the 
	secrets of this new Colosseum? <br>
	<br>
	<b>The Colosseum. </b><br>
	This is pretty much what it sounds like. The Colosseum is a dungeon of sorts 
	with repeatable content. The premise is very simple. Players will enter the 
	Colosseum and fight their way through increasingly difficult stages. There 
	is no timer on repeating, so players will be able to enter The Colosseum as 
	often as they would like, as long as their initial 60 minute timer is up.
	<br>
	<br>
	Players of any level will be able to participate, but The Colosseum is 
	geared towards fellowships. In order to go through, you must be part of a 
	fellowship. When players enter, they will be in a staging area which will be 
	used by everyone. This is a great place to get your fellowships together, or 
	to find a group to tag along with. Once in a fellowship, one person will 
	need to purchase a ticket at a reasonable cost from a nearby NPC. That 
	person will then give the ticket to the starter NPC who will lock the 
	fellowship and let them know they can enter The Colosseum. <br>
	<br>
	The initial download time upon entering is a bit longer than most places. 
	The drop is not hot so players are safe upon entrance and should only have 
	to go through this download once. Once you hand in your ticket, your 
	fellowship will have 1 hour to finish the Arena from the time that they 
	start. After this time is up they will all be teleported out of the arena 
	and will be able to speak to the NPC to get their reward. The rewards will 
	depend on how far the fellowship has made it in The Colosseum. If you die in 
	the arena you will be able to re-enter through the first door and then go 
	through all the doors that you have passed through, they will remain open 
	and the creatures will remain dead in previous stages as long as you are 
	within the 1 hour time limit allotted to your fellowship. We have made The 
	Colosseum an area in the game where you will not drop death items, due to 
	very high possibility of people not being able to recover their corpses. <br>
	<br>
	There will be 5 branches of The Colosseum so 5 fellowships full of players 
	may do The Colosseum every hour. Once a fellowship is inside a branch of The 
	Colosseum, that branch is locked from letting other players in. In the 
	coming months we have plans to further update The Colosseum with things such 
	as Boss fights, which can be unlocked by completing various stages in The 
	Colosseum. We have also made it possible for higher level players to skip 
	the first few low levels if they so choose.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Squelch Panel</b><br>
	The Squelch Panel has been added to the game. Players will be able to locate 
	the Squelch Panel on their social tab. In order to add a player to your 
	squelch list, simply add the players name to the space provided in the panel 
	and hit the Squelch Character button. If you want to squelch the account 
	associated with that character, just hit the squelch account button after 
	putting the character name in the space provided. The display will tell 
	players if it is an account or character squelch.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Craft Buffing Pets<br>
	</b>Craft Buffing Pets have been added to the game. These pets will provide 
	buffs to Cooking, Alchemy, Fletching, and Lockpick. These buffs are 
	stackable with all other similar spells. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Spell Words and Squelching<br>
	</b>Players who have another player squelched will now be able to see that 
	players spell words, even though they are squelched. If a player has 
	filtered spellcasting, they will still not be able to see the spell words.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>NPC Interactions</b><br>
	Once again the team has been hard at work trying to discover ways we can 
	continue to improve the tech and functionality of Asheron's Call. One of the 
	things that has been developed is the ability for NPC's to determine what a 
	player has in their packs. For example, if Player A has 10 diamond powders 
	in their pack and they talk to a certain NPC, that NPC will be able to see 
	that and decide what message to send to Player A. This will give us the 
	ability to start offering questing choices. So a player who has a particular 
	item or items in their pack may get a different response then the player 
	next to him who doesn't. While this may not seem overly exciting, it will 
	give us the opportunity to do some things with player, NPC interactions that 
	we had not been able to do in the past. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In concept </b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. Each month we 
	will be discussing one new in concept topic, in order to give you as much 
	information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	One of the end game concepts we are looking at is an invasion mechanic that 
	will bring interest and combat into some of the towns of Asheron's Call. 
	Although we don't want to reveal the story reasons or culprits behind such 
	an invasion, the encounter would be designed to not only provide players an 
	opportunity to battle in certain town layouts but to engage in competitive 
	content as well.<br>
	<br>
	The central focal point behind the invasion is a rift that summons the 
	invading creatures. So long as the rift exists the creatures will slowly 
	spawn around the landscape. This makes the invaded town a dangerous place to 
	be. More importantly to players is that the rift itself can be destabilized 
	and destroyed. The person who finally destroys the rift gets a valuable 
	reward.<br>
	<br>
	In order to destroy the rift, the players must take something from the 
	invading creatures. This item gives the rift power and enough of these can 
	destabilize it. In order to destroy the rift the players must kill the 
	creatures and gather some number of these items. The first person to gather 
	enough of these items loots the rift and takes the reward. This destroys the 
	rift and ends the invasion, at least until the invading force can once again 
	muster the magical power to create another rift. All of these items are drop 
	on death, and these items will fade after an hour so you have limited time 
	to gather them.<br>
	<br>
	On PvP servers, this mechanic creates a battlefield where the players must 
	not only kill the invading force, but they must escape other players trying 
	to kill them for their items. The battle will carry the players street to 
	street, fighting off invading creatures and each other for the right to loot 
	the rift. The encounter is meant to highlight street to street combat in the 
	complex environment of the cities. On PvE servers the players must race to 
	kill enough creatures to earn the right to destroy the rift and claim the 
	reward. The players can choose to cooperate to end the invasion or to 
	compete for these items by racing to kill the required number of creatures 
	before anyone else. Since the items fade after one hour the players not only 
	have a time limit in which to gather these items, but they cannot save up 
	items for future invasions.<br>
	<br>
	In order to maximize the chance that players can participate either solo or 
	in groups, the rifts won't simply appear without warning. Each rift creates 
	a tell tale energy signature in the town some time before it goes active. 
	The rift appears and changes color as it becomes closer to being active. 
	This allows players to gather friends and allies before the carnage begins.<br>
	<br>
	As we create and test the scenario we will be looking at the specific 
	numbers and tweaking the details of the mechanics to create the best 
	experience possible. We will be looking at the difficulty to kill each 
	creature, the chance it will drop an item, the number of items needed to 
	loot and destroy the rift, the time the rift will take from first appearance 
	to becoming active, and of course the all important &quot;valuable items&quot; found 
	in the rift.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	February and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	February event.<br>
