	<p>
    Mundagurg opened the canteen and sniffed it suspiciously. Three times he had 
	returned to Angry Grandfather for help or at least advice, and three times 
	Angry Grandfather had told him things he didn’t really understand. The third 
	time, however, Angry Grandfather had given him this canteen and instructed 
	him to “take care of it and stop bothering me, or ask somebody else.” So 
	he’d taken the canteen and come up here again, to this distressed strand of 
	beach where his glorious service on behalf of his confusing patron deity had 
	ground to a frustrating halt at the finned hands of some corruption-fouled 
	beasts that smelled even more pungent than he and his fellow Merwarts did.<br>
	<br>
	Mundagurg, for his part, was flummoxed by Angry Grandfather’s reluctance to 
	come away from his shrine in the human settlement and use some of his 
	awe-inspiring magical powers to help one of his most loyal and daring 
	disciples. After all, who else among the Merwarts raised up by Angry 
	Grandfather had been hardy or clever enough to explore so much of this 
	strange and confusing land? Only Mundagurg. And had not Angry Grandfather 
	demonstrated his godlike powers to them when he first raised them up? Had he 
	not shown the ability to conjure fire in his hands and to call lightning 
	from a cloudless sky? Had he not shared with them the secrets of the Blue 
	Stone and the Magic Brew? Why was he reluctant to smite the enemies of his 
	people?<br>
	<br>
	The confused little Merwart waggled his big, melon-shaped head in 
	resignation and decided that it was not for him to question the wisdom of 
	Angry Grandfather. There had to be some reason why Angry Grandfather had 
	tasked him with exploring all of this island, but would then refuse to 
	assist him when an impediment to the mission arose, not even an hour’s walk 
	from Angry Grandfather’s own shrine!<br>
	<br>
	Sighing in a human-like gesture that he’d picked up during his travels, 
	Mundagurg pushed all his doubts back. He had a task to accomplish now, and 
	then he’d be able to think about more complex theological matters later on. 
	Having settled his own internal debate, at least temporarily, he held his 
	breath and took a big gulp from the canteen. The thick, bitter liquid almost 
	overwhelmed him with its powerful, almost grotesque taste, smell, and fizzy 
	texture, but his long practice and devotion to Angry Grandfather’s rituals 
	helped him overcome his natural aversion to the strong drink.<br>
	<br>
	Almost immediately, he was rewarded for his efforts by a surge of energy 
	throughout his battered limbs. The vitality that flowed through him 
	bolstered his own confidence in himself. He scrambled up on top of the rock 
	formation that he’d been hiding behind and examined the scene again.<br>
	<br>
	There was a hole in the land here. The Fin-heads had dug their way up out of 
	some hidden warren and were in the process of trying to claim a portion of 
	the beach for themselves. More and more Fin-heads came out of this hole 
	every day, and he’d even been able to get a glimpse of their apparent 
	leader, a taller, smellier, shambling specimen that Angry Grandfather had 
	named “Blightfinger” when Mundagurg described the situation. Mundagurg had 
	explored just about every other inch of the humans’ island, and he knew that 
	the Fin-heads were not native to this area. They mostly kept to other areas, 
	nearer to the hot, smelly Vesayen Isles that Mundagurg had already explored 
	and catalogued, months ago, as one of his first tasks.<br>
	<br>
	“Must learn to stop fearing what happen maybe later, think about what happen 
	now for sure,” Mundagurg repeated. It was a rough paraphrase of the advice 
	Angry Grandfather had offered him each time he’d come seeking guidance on 
	how to deal with the Fin-heads.<br>
	<br>
	“Okay,” he muttered to himself. “Go get club off dead not-me, then run away 
	before Fin-heads send me back to Blue Stone… Then think about future 
	maybes.”<br>
	<br>
	Mundagurg took a deep breath and vaulted over the rock formation. He hit the 
	sand running, and his flat, flapping feet helped him keep a fast pace over 
	the shifty sand as he sprinted forward. There was a handful of the Fin-heads 
	outside of the cave mouth this time. One of them saw him coming and turned 
	to bellow a warning to its fellows, but it was too late. The speeding 
	Merwart was past the knot of them and running through cool, damp tunnels as 
	fast as his little legs would carry him.<br>
	<br>
	Mundagurg, like the rest of his fellow Merwarts, was not particularly smart, 
	but his sense of direction in the dark was excellent, and he navigated the 
	tunnels of the Fin-heads with ease, despite only having been through here 
	briefly, and while fighting the whole time. He navigated the corridors 
	without tripping on the vines that had slowed him up the first time, and he 
	managed to evade or slip past a few other Fin-heads. Despite his adept 
	maneuvers, the noises that reverberated through the tunnels behind him made 
	it clear that the outside patrollers were still chasing him.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, after a few twists and turns, and with by now half a dozen monsters 
	on his trail, Mundagurg found what he was looking for: his own corpse. To 
	even look upon the empty shell that once was his body inspired a tremor of 
	theological terror in him. Not even the lessons provided by Angry 
	Grandfather would ever completely quell his discomfort in seeing and 
	interacting with his own corpse. But he managed to shove away those concerns 
	long enough to reach out and take the glowing green club from his own dead 
	hand: the prized weapon he’d carved himself, and lost during his first 
	fateful trip into these tunnels.<br>
	<br>
	His club retrieved, Mundagurg spared a second to listen to the grunts and 
	shrieks of his pursuers as they closed in on his position. He took an 
	experimental swing, felt the strength still flowing through him, and tried 
	to find an out-of-the-way corner in which he could hide for a moment, just 
	long enough to surprise his hunters. He glanced back at his own body, and at 
	the vines that crawled up the walls of these tunnels, and came up with an 
	idea…<br>
	<br>
	The Fin-head pursuit arrived just a few moments later. They saw the corpse 
	of the little Merwart still clutching its club on the ground, and they saw 
	the Merwart himself, apparently tangled in some of the hanging vines nearby. 
	Roaring in outrage at the intrusion, they launched themselves at the little 
	Merwart. So blinded were they by primitive anger that they didn’t even 
	notice the corpse get up, wielding its club with a fiendish gleam in its 
	eyes. They jumped on the decoy in a pile and proceeded to become thoroughly 
	tangled up with each other.<br>
	<br>
	Mundagurg’s first swing of the club shattered the kneecap of the last 
	Fin-head that had jumped on the pile drawn by his corpse. The beast shrieked 
	in pain and fell onto its fellows. By the time the beasts got themselves 
	untangled, their quarry was far down the tunnels, chortling in glee. They 
	could hear the hue and cry from their fellow tunnel-dwellers as the Merwart 
	made his escape, but without advanced warning or a concerted hunt, the 
	little Merwart could evade any one of them individually and probably make 
	good his escape. <br>
	<br>
	Mundagurg emerged from the tunnel still running at a breakneck pace, too 
	afraid to even look back. Even though the sounds of pursuit died down a few 
	hundred yards from the hole, he didn’t slow down until he was within sight 
	of Angry Grandfather’s town. Surely, he thought, some kind human friend of 
	Angry Grandfather’s would be happy to kill all those Fin-heads, if only he 
	could come up with the right reward to bribe them with… It was always 
	rewards with the humans, after all.<br>

	<p>In a newly constructed underground fortress, protected from spying eyes 
	by powerful concealing magic, a pair of old friends and sometime rivals 
	stared across a table at each other. A nervous courier stood between them. 
	The table, copied from a similar piece of furniture in Queen Elysa’s royal 
	map room, bore a huge, detailed map of the great island of Dereth and all 
	its surrounding lands. Piled on top of the table, obscuring parts of the 
	landmass, sat a pile of papers – reports from scouts who had combed the 
	realm and investigated the recent ley line disturbances.<br>
	<br>
	The elder of the two seated figures, an aged Empyrean mage named Harlune, 
	sat back and fixed the scout with a suspicious eye. “Well, go on, then,” he 
	growled.<br>
	<br>
	The courier cleared his throat, picked up the next dispatch, and snuck a 
	glance at the other seated figure, whose only expression, a serene and 
	sleepy-eyed smile, had not changed since this session began. Shaking his 
	head, he read the dispatch out loud. “Discovered single playing card on 
	corpse of undead Lady Tairla. Card depicts itself as Queen of Hands. Appears 
	to be part of larger suit of Hands. Suspect Jester to be involved. Will 
	continue to hunt graveyard and seek other cards. Also compiling list of 
	Jester utterances, which could be crucial information or utter nonsense. 
	Await further instructions.”<br>
	<br>
	Harlune snorted. “Once again it comes back to this Jester, eh? How did an 
	undead fool gain such importance? He was a fool in life, and I’m now to 
	believe that he is a repository of ancient wisdom just because he’s dead and 
	his bones haven’t turned to dust yet? Are we supposed to fall all over 
	ourselves investigating every time someone makes a knock-knock joke or 
	passes wind comedically?”<br>
	<br>
	“You are ignoring the context of this discovery, old friend,” his companion 
	said from across the table. “The Jester was present for Rytheran’s mistake. 
	He may hold the key to what has happened to the ley lines. The journal pages 
	from Rytheran’s study that we received last month suggests as much. I, in 
	particular, am eager to hear what this Jester has to say. Remember, by 
	tradition, a fool was often the one person in court who could speak truths 
	the courtiers were too timid to acknowledge.”<br>
	<br>
	Harlune shook his head angrily. “Sometimes a fool is just a fool! And I 
	don’t believe that those pages tell a true tale. Rytheran got hold of the 
	Book of Eibhil, used it just once, and then willingly gave it over to his 
	master? Preposterous, I say. He could have obliterated Geraine with the 
	book.”<br>
	<br>
	“At what cost to himself? Just because you do not understand why he would 
	surrender such power, it does not mean he did not do so.”<br>
	<br>
	“I understand more about surrendering power than you’ll ever know, woman,” 
	Harlune muttered, but he waved his hand as if to concede that point. Quickly 
	enough, he blustered on to another issue.<br>
	<br>
	“I still think we’d be better served if we spent our limited reconnaissance 
	abilities investigating the undead and the witch’s little gang of cultists,” 
	he insisted, thumping the table for emphasis. “Whatever important 
	discoveries there are to be made will come clear soon enough, and we’ll at 
	least be able to make sure that they can’t steal a march on us!”<br>
	<br>
	“I agree that it is important to learn what our rivals plan, and in time we 
	can do that. But for now, we must look at the things that have occurred – 
	the bleeding ley lines, the tainted Moarsmen arriving on the western shore, 
	and now these strange cards appearing in the graveyard -- and concentrate 
	our resources on discovering the true nature of this threat to the realm. We 
	must first achieve our own goals before we worry about the movements of our 
	rivals. Nor am I convinced that they are actually inimical to our purposes!”<br>
	<br>
	Harlune crossed his arms stubbornly. “We must seek to know what the others 
	plan, if only to protect ourselves against their treachery. We know the 
	witch hates us and wants to exterminate us. How can we watch our enemies, 
	and you’ll see in time that they are our enemies, if we leave ourselves 
	blind to their movements? We can’t figure out what they’re planning if 
	you’re sending people off to Bur or down some rabbit hole in the Graveyard!”<br>
	<br>
	The woman at the opposite end of the table sighed and flicked her eyes 
	towards the courier, practically forgotten by this point. “When we have 
	judged that it is proper to recruit more Isparians to our cause, they will 
	be the ones who take on these additional burdens.”<br>
	<br>
	Harlune laughed bitterly as he, too, looked at the courier, who was doing 
	his best to stare straight down at the piled dispatches. “You place too much 
	faith in them, Ben Ten. Always have.”</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=575">Turbine Site</a>, 
	April 11, 200</font></span></p>
	<p>Hello there and welcome to the Release Notes for the April event, Upping 
	the Ante. This month we have heard some reports about the Jester appearing 
	in the Graveyard. Cooldown timers have been added to the game. Aside from 
	some new content rewards, players will first notice this new tech on their 
	Throne of Destiny gems. Let see what else is going on this month in 
	Asheron’s Call.<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cooldown Timers have been added to the game.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Throne of Destiny gems have been changed to use this new 
		cooldown tech. Players will now need to wait 30 seconds between each 
		use. This tech is intended to be used on new items as well.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Aerbax has been revised again to resolve the issues that have been 
		seen with him returning back to health. Please keep in mind if a player 
		or players attempt to trap Aerbax in a state where he is trapped or in a 
		state where he cannot hit players, he will return back to his home 
		location and return to full health. The action is working as intended to 
		prevent players from exploiting the nature of the platform that the 
		fight takes place on. The new mechanic to prevent the unplanned 
		instances where Aerbax returns to full health, is as follows. Players 
		fighting Aerbax will get him down to a certain health level which 
		triggers him to teleport to a new platform. And in appearance, that is 
		what will happen. The actual tech change in this case is that instead of 
		Aerbax teleporting himself, he will get to a certain health rate, delete 
		himself and cause a new version to spawn at the next platform, at a 
		reduced health level. Please keep in mind that when the new form of 
		Aerbax shows up, it will say he is at 100% health, but upon closer ID, 
		players will be able to see his overall health is lower.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Emissary of Asheron now fixes all the reward bugs when you talk 
		to him and if a player has received two helms one can be given for the 
		next piece of armor.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The timer emote on Aerbax no longer counts down incorrectly (was 
		saying 5 min left 4 3 2 5)<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Jester has shown up in the graveyard. Players may want to 
		investigate this move.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Jester will now re-teach players the Arcane Pyramid spell if 
		they have deleted it out of their spellbooks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Jester now tells players when he teaches them the Arcane Pyramid 
		spell.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Ghost Jailer will now know if you released the Jester and give a 
		different response.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>If players free the Jester and then go back and free him again 
		before their timer is up, they will no longer be able to start in the 
		cell room.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Players can now choose to spawn at beginning of the Jester dungeon 
		or at the trap in case they skipped turning in the letter to the wall.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Mages should now be able to hit The Jester with a bit more ease now.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>An issue where players could possibly get stuck on the Shadow 
		Kresovus quest has been fixed.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Burun Collar on the Asheron’s Abductor quest no longer looks 
		like Darling’s Collar.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Player corpses that have no items or Pyreals on them will now self 
		delete after about 30 seconds. This should apply to regular corpses as 
		well as PK Lite corpses.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Dark Scarabs should no longer burn upon use. They now will just go 
		away one their timer is up.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Due to the issues we had in the March event, the Tanada House of 
		Pancakes will be open with the start of the April event from 4/15/2008 
		through 4/22/2008.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>An announcement is now made when a player uses a volatile rare. For 
		those who do not know, these are rares that are burned upon use such as 
		melee defense or magic defense rare gems. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call 
	in April. Please remember that along with everything listed here, there are 
	several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the April 
	event. <br>
