	<a name="2"></a>The Bunnies of Dereth vs Chef Wubbie!</span></b><p>Maggie! 
	HIHIHIHIHI!<br>
	<br>
	Its me again, Chef Wubbie of TD. I was just the center of attention in a 
	Live Event. I've always been a little scared of the bunnies and rabbits in 
	Dereth, there was more than once early on in my life where they killed me.<br>
	<br>
	Imagine my surprise this morning when I was dual logged in to summon a 
	portal to put away some beers I had been making when I looked down and saw a 
	bunny next to my mule in Marketplace. As I tabbed back to take the portal, 
	the bunny disappeared... he had taken my portal. I went thru the portal and 
	suddenly bunnies of all sorts started to appear around me. This was a little 
	frightening, and then they vanished. Then Twilight Rabbits appeared and 
	charged me. I ran and hid in the villa, Wearing my bathrobe, beret and white 
	bunny slippers, I was not exactly prepared to fight.</p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">

	<p>I thought I was being stalked by the rabbits. At first people didn't 
	believe me. Then as I was taking the last of the beer to the chests, rabbits 
	spawned and surrounded the villa. I ran to the basement to chest the beer 
	and find some safety... Only to discover a rabbit in the basement. I fled to 
	Candeth Keep and the safety of the tree to get my armor on and buff. Imagine 
	the surprise as bunnies appeared on the platform up the tree.<br>
	<br>
	With some help I fled to Hub aka Abandoned Mines, to try to escape the 
	bunnies.... As we sat and chatted about where to go... imagine Shogunz's 
	surprise as the room filled with rabbits and bunnies. One poor soul had 
	portaled in to travel somewhere and they were trapped in the room with us as 
	the door in hub had reappeared. We battled them! Then just as suddenly as it 
	started, the rabbits vanished and the door vanished. I fled towards Arwic in 
	a panic. We killed every rabbit we came across, just to be safe.... 
	Suddenly, carrots and carrot cake appeared... never a good sign!<br>
	<br>
	Soon more rabbits and multiple pookies appeared. Shogunz, Southern Yankee 
	and myself tried to battle them. Then they vanished... As I begged for more 
	help on General, and tried to get people to believe that yes, indeed, this 
	was happening... Giant Pillars of Fire appeared in a ring around us.... I 
	did what any smart Chef would do as I was hit with fire... I ran! Southern 
	Yankee fought valiantly, but the fires were too much. Then some Divine 
	Virindi appeared... Bunnies in league with the Virindi?! More people came to 
	help and the battle was joined... but the rabbits had other plans... I found 
	myself portaled high above Teth and floating gently to the ground. Suddenly 
	more rabbits attacked. As I let people know where I was screaming HALP in my 
	best 10 yr old girl voice, I battled the bunnies... As the team arrived I 
	found myself portaled by evil bunny magic yet again... this would repeat 
	many times... Kryst, Tufa, Aerbax's Holding, Tufa.</p><span lang="en-us">

	<p>As the rest of the team ran to Tufa, I battled more rabbits...Thankfully, 
	there was a small lull in the action and people helped me keep my buffs up 
	so I could continue the battle. As we pondered what evil the bunnies had in 
	store for me next, I noticed a small icon on the ground... It was a Lucky 
	White Rabbits Foot!! As each member of the team picked up a Lucky White 
	Foot, they were transported thru dark bunny magic to Teth. I received a 
	Carrot Dagger with a special inscription and a green rabbits foot when I 
	said I was happy because now I could get the title I had always desired... 
	but then I found myself traveling thru dark bunny magic back to Teth... high 
	above the city floating downwards...</p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">

	<p>As people wondered if it was over the final battle began... Biaka was 
	able to slay the last pookie and gave his life in the process... sadly his 
	ISP dropped him at the same time and he missed out on a bunny orb :(<br>
	<br>
	I am sure there are more details I am leaving out, but I am much too shaken 
	by this experience to go on... So as a warning PLEASE EVERYONE BE VERY 
	CAREFUL AROUND RABBITS AND BUNNIES!<br>
	<br>
	I would like to thank +Turbine Rome - bunny wrangler extraordinaire! Shogunz 
	and Southern Yankee for believing me and not suspecting I have had to many 
	beers and mushrooms... Tromeros, Revolver, Biaka, Gaetano, Miss Busan, 
	MagicPipe II and everyone else who came to aid a Chef in his time of Bunny 
	error!<br>
	<br>
	Oh yeah... I gave up making tons of money from the white rabbits foot to 
	gain the title I had wanted for so very long... Supreme Bunny Master! Why? 
	Cause it made sense to me!<br>

	Alza's Mage of VT reports: &quot;I was down in Eggs Orchard early morning on 
	March 31st. All of a sudden a sunflower spawned. At first I thought someone 
	ran by and dropped it, but then I ID'd it and in the ID it said, &quot;Hi Alza's 
	Mage.&quot; I didn't say anything at first, then I ID'd the flower again and it 
	said, &quot;You are so cold Alza's mage.&quot; After chatting for a while with it, I 
	asked it how it survived down in ER. It came to it being a carnivore and a 
	summoner all in one. It wanted to eat me...so I asked it to show me its sun 
	first. It said &quot;Okay, you asked for it.&quot; A few minutes later a Fire Pillar 
	spawned right behind it. I fought it for a bit, but before I could kill it, 
	it vanished. </span></p>

	a couple of friends killing cows and other stuff when a white rabbit spawned 
	out of no where! After a long battle, we finally killed it. On the corpse 
	was a bunny orb, son of pookie gem, and a Pooky Token. After IDing the token 
	it said to turn it in to Larry the Rabbit Master (2.0N, 41.6E). After 
	turning in the token I got the following message:<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Larry the Rabbit Master Pooky Token.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Larry the Rabbit Master tells you, &quot;What's this? A

	Larry the Rabbit Master tells you, &quot;You Sir, should be rewarded for your 
	agricultural beneficence!&quot;<br>
	Larry the Rabbit Master says, &quot;You hear that you rabbits! We have a Fuzzy 
	Bunny Slayer here! Better hop on out of here now or else!&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	Thanks to Baebarri and Magi of the Rose in the discovery and help with this.<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span></p>

	did the Son of Pookie quest tonight. Along the way in the dungeon we found a 
	Hulking Bunny (did not get a SS). We killed it, all got a token and I got a 
	hulking bunny pelt.<br>
	<br>
	Turned the token into Larry the Bunny Master, he told us this: <br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Larry the Rabbit Master says, &quot;You hear that you 
	rabbits! We have a Fuzzy Bunny Slayer here! Better hop on out of here now or 
	else!&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	I then went to Lytelthorpe, found William Witty (per the instructions on the 
	pelt, and got this from him:<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">William Witty tells you, &quot;My, oh my! Just look at the 
	size of this thing!&quot;<br>
	William Witty tells you, &quot;You say this rabbit was protecting the others? 
	I've heard just about every rabbit story there is to tell, but this one 
	takes the carrot cake!&quot;<br>
	William Witty tells you, &quot;I'm no April's Fool, you must have stitched this 
	pelt together from smaller rabbit skins...&quot;<br>
	William Witty tells you, &quot;Hmm, no seams. I just can't get over how darn big 
	this thing is. Ok, give me a minute and I'll have some ridiculously large 
	slippers for you.&quot;<br>
	William Witty tells you, &quot;There ya go! One Hulking Pair of Bunny Slippers. 
	Since you had so much pelt to work with I did some fancy stitch-work and 
	made another rabbit face for the second slipper. Happy hunting and good 
	speed!&quot;</font><br>

	He also gave me these: Hulking Bunny Slippers, AL 50, Jahannan's Blessing,<br>
