	<p>
    Ardry shook the snow from his boots as he stepped wearily into the 
	Thorsten's Rest tavern atop the hill in Cragstone. He nodded to the other 
	regulars and settled into a table by the fire, hunching over a mug of cider 
	and a bowl of beef stew. Blood dripped into the stew from a gashed wound on 
	his forehead, but he either didn't notice or didn't care. He shoveled the 
	stew into his mouth with the unblinking dedication of the truly exhausted.<br>
	<br>
	Nor did he look up when the tavern door opened up again to again send cold, 
	snowy wind gusting through the tavern. A lone man entered and approached the 
	bar. A casual glance told Ardry that he was a Sho, leanly muscled and 
	dressed in well-used but well-maintained leather armor. The stranger ordered 
	a cup of water and sipped his drink while casting covert glances around the 
	room. He was being reasonably discreet about it, but over the years Ardry 
	had developed a preternatural ability to sense when people were looking for 
	him. He could feel the hairs prickle on the back of his neck as the 
	stranger's gaze drifted, in a studiously nonchalant way, repeatedly to him.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, he could take no more. He dropped his spoon and sat up straight, 
	reaching under the table to grasp the hilt of a dagger he'd stashed on his 
	leg for just such a barroom encounter. Apparently sensing his paranoia, the 
	stranger circled around so that he could approach Ardry from the front.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry looked directly at him as he approached, as much to establish eye 
	contact as to be able to observe the way this stranger moved in case it did 
	turn into a fight. The stranger moved with the grace of a warrior trained in 
	some of the more esoteric Sho combat arts, but he was nervous and unsure of 
	himself. Ardry sighed, and addressed the man as he came to the table.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I hope you're not here to kill me for trespassing in yet another fighting 
	school, because I'm pretty tired of getting perforated by exquisitely 
	trained Sho killers. Please tell me you're not a Tanada.<br>
	<br>
	The man blinked several times, taken totally off guard by Ardry's 
	conversational gambit. He recovered himself, and grinned nervously. &quot;I 
	apologize for my scrutiny, sir, but I seek a man named Ardry, nephew of the 
	great sage Aliester the Loquacious. Are you Ardry the Dubious?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I am Ardry the Not Running Dangerous Scouting Missions Any More,&quot; Ardry 
	snorted, releasing his grip on the dagger and taking a long drink from his 
	cider. He gestured at the other chair by the table. &quot;Yes, I'm the man you're 
	looking for. Have a seat. I assume my uncle sent you?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Not directly, sir,&quot; the stranger said. &quot;My name is Shan Zhen, but please 
	just call me Zhen.&quot; He sat eagerly at the table. &quot;My mistress sent me to 
	find you, at your uncle's recommendation. She said you were a brave and 
	resourceful scout. And that maybe you'd share some of what you found on your 
	most recent expeditions if I were able to promise you a meeting with my 
	mistress. She sends a token to prove to you that I am not lying.&quot; He reached 
	into a pouch and set a small medallion on the table.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry's eyes widened. &quot;All right, Zhen. You've got me interested. What did 
	you want to know?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;My mistress is curious about some of the notes you've found in the course 
	of exploring dungeons we had previously believed to be thoroughly mapped. 
	Notes that were written by a certain missing wizard that she is trying to 
	help locate. When you wrote to your uncle about them, he passed word on to 
	her.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded. &quot;I did find some notes... Three of them. I found the first one 
	while investigating the earthquake near Lady Folthid's estate. Most of it 
	went right over my head, though. There were some strange mathematical 
	notations...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Zhen leaned forward, excited. &quot;Yes! The numbers. I have reason to believe 
	that those numbers are actually the key to recovering a journal that Asheron 
	left behind.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry considered this as he drank the last of his cider. &quot;Well, that's 
	interesting, all right. How would the numbers help you find his journal?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;He covered his tracks well. We have reason to believe he may have thought 
	someone or some thing was trying to follow him, with evil intent. So he left 
	his journal somewhere safe and hidden, reachable only by people who could 
	use the numbers he left to decipher the clues and find the journal.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry grimaced. &quot;Sounds complicated. What's in this journal that's worth so 
	much trouble?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Information on where he went, and how he went there. Notes on a geomantic 
	portal-opening ritual... To another world.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry laughed. &quot;There aren't many people in Dereth who can work 
	portal-opening rituals my friend, let alone to another world. An Empyrean 
	could do it, but you're not going to get that old crank Harlune to crawl out 
	from under his rock to help. As for Isparians working that kind of powerful 
	ritual... That's even less likely. Trust me, my uncle has been trying to 
	figure out how to do it for years, and he knows as much about geomancy as 
	any Isparian.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Zhen grinned, with a disconcertingly sly expression. &quot;With all due respect 
	to your venerable uncle, Ardry, there are some Isparians who are capable of 
	such magic. At least one has learned under Asheron himself. With the proper 
	guidance, perhaps the information left in the journal...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry took a deep breath. &quot;Very interesting.&quot; He stood, picked up his bowl 
	and his mug, and brought them to the bar for the barkeeper Magrom to clean 
	up. He came back to the table, shaking his head. &quot;All right, I'll help you.&quot; 
	He paused and glared suspiciously at Zhen. &quot;And you're sure this means I get 
	a meeting with your mistress?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Zhen nodded enthusiastically. &quot;She wishes to discuss the matter with you 
	personally. To review the notes you have found. She believes the numbers 
	hold the key unlocking the mechanisms Asheron left behind to protect his 
	journal.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Lead on then, Zhen,&quot; Ardry said. &quot;Even though I'm pretty sure that before 
	all this is over I'm somehow going to end up leaving a few more mutilated 
	corpses around Dereth...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The two men exited the tavern, one walking briskly with his head high and 
	his eyes hopeful, the other slouching wearily behind as he considered the 
	punishment that was sure to be in store for getting involved with another 
	mysterious cause.</p>

	December 19, 2006</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">The sound of clashing weapons echoed through the 
	corridors of Queen Elysa's palace in Dereth. The noise came from the 
	training room, where young Prince Borelean sparred against the veteran 
	guerilla commander, Captain Tharnoch.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean's sword slammed repeatedly against Tharnoch's defending blade as he 
	tried to batter aside the older man's defenses. They had been sparring for 
	half an hour without pause, and both were beginning to sweat. Borelean had 
	spent the entire fight on the attack, lunging and jumping and raining blows 
	on his opponent from every conceivable angle. Tharnoch, by contrast, fought 
	in a crablike stance, shuffling guardedly from side to side and moving with 
	an economy of motion honed over decades of combat experience. His 
	conservative style helped him keep even in the endurance battle against his 
	teenage opponent.<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch growled as he parried aside another arcing overhand strike from the 
	Prince. &quot;Your Highness,&quot; he said, &quot;while you are skilled beyond your years, 
	your fighting style is wasteful and poorly judged.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean came ahead, striking quickly, forcing his opponent to give ground. 
	&quot;How so?&quot; Borelean asked, somewhat cockily, as he launched a side cut that 
	almost hit Tharnoch in the arm before the captain slid out of the way. &quot;It 
	seems to me I almost have you against the wall, Captain.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch's response came as the Prince tried another powerful overhand 
	slash. He sidestepped the blow as it came down and lashed out with his left 
	hand, knocking Borelean's sword out wide and low, too far out of position to 
	defend himself adequately. He pressed into the opening he'd created and 
	brought the sword to bear on the Prince's chest. <br>
	<br>
	Before Tharnoch could call for his opponent to yield, Borelean went along 
	with the shove he'd gotten from the captain. He continued the down-and-out 
	motion, rolling and spinning with impressive athleticism. Before Tharnoch 
	could react, Borelean's leg whipped out and caught him with a solid kick to 
	the stomach. Tharnoch was too battle-hardened to give in to the pain, but 
	the kick pushed him back and created enough separation for Borelean to bring 
	his sword back up into a proper guard posture.<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch laughed and dropped his blade to his side to signal an end to the 
	duel. &quot;Well done!&quot; he roared. He actually seemed to be pleased by absorbing 
	a hard kick in the gut. &quot;Fighters trained by nobles are often too proud to 
	use a good kick or head-butt in combat. It's not pretty, and a lot of fools 
	will tell you it's ungentlemanly, but the only thing that matters at the end 
	of a fight is who's standing and who's bleeding on the dirt. All your bloody 
	nobles are nobles because some ancestor of theirs was smart enough to kick 
	an opponent in the fork and win the fight.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	He paused to probe his bruised stomach with his fingers. &quot;Good technique on 
	the kick, too. Led with the heel, to get the most stopping power out of 
	it... You could become a real warrior yet.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean grinned, but tried not to be too happy with himself, in case 
	Tharnoch was readying a sucker-punch or something else to underscore the 
	message about fighting dirty. The veteran did no such thing, but he was 
	regarding Borelean with a thoughtful gaze.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;In fact, Your Highness, I am fairly certain you didn't learn that kind of 
	technique from Antius Blackmoor. All I've heard of the man suggests he was 
	brave, noble, and foolish enough to get himself killed by someone with lower 
	standards of decency. And I know that the soldiers from my own detachment 
	have been too busy with other duties to instruct you...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean didn't say anything to that. He just stared at the captain with a 
	blank gaze. Tharnoch cleared his throat during the uncomfortable pause.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;All right, I'll just ask. Are you training with someone else, Your 
	Highness?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean answered with the same studiously blank gaze fixed on his face. 
	&quot;No, Captain Tharnoch, I have no other combat trainers. Could you elaborate 
	further upon your earlier comment? How is my fighting style wasteful?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch frowned suspiciously at his pupil. He was almost certain that 
	Borelean was lying, or at least failing to report the whole truth. But he 
	didn't want to derail the training session with an inquisition, so he made a 
	mental note to speak to the Queen about the Prince's training, and answered 
	Borelean's question.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The problem, Your Highness, is that while you will no doubt one day be a 
	very strong man, perhaps as strong as I've heard your father was, you are 
	not stronger than I am now. Yet you tried to fight me in a battle of 
	strength. You expended a lot of energy trying to overpower my defense, 
	which, frankly, you cannot do. But you're quicker than me, and you've got 
	the energy and spry legs to beat me through mobility. Use that to your 
	advantage. Don't try to knock down the walls when you can take out the gate 
	more easily. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean bowed his head thoughtfully and regarded Tharnoch with a new 
	respect in his eyes. &quot;You are wise, Captain Tharnoch. I will remember that. 
	But how should I know if I'm stronger than someone else, or faster?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch nodded sagely. &quot;That's what the early part of a fight is for. With 
	feints and probing attacks, get a sense of your opponent's capabilities, 
	before you commit yourself in earnest. If you tried, for example, to 
	outmaneuver a faster man...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	They were interrupted by a knock on the door. Borelean stepped to attention 
	and Tharnoch, irritated by the interruption, called out, &quot;Enter!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	A royal messenger stepped through the door, bowed to the Prince, and saluted 
	the captain. &quot;Your Highness Prince Borelean,&quot; the messenger said, &quot;Her 
	Highness the Queen requests your presence in the library. Captain Tharnoch 
	is hereby dismissed from duty for the rest of the afternoon.&quot; The messenger 
	bowed, saluted, and departed.<br>
	<br>
	The two fighters looked at each other. &quot;Well, lad, get on with you,&quot; 
	Tharnoch said. &quot;We'll pick up back here tomorrow. Unless your mother wants 
	you in the library again,&quot; he snorted. He hung his sword in the rack of 
	training weapons and left the room.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean gritted his teeth as he watched Tharnoch go. He didn't like having 
	his training interrupted by this peremptory summons to the library. He hung 
	his own sword on the rack and stalked out of the room. He didn't even bother 
	to change out of his sweat-stained training leathers before he went to the 
	library.<br>
	<br>
	A few moments later, still angry, he pushed open the library doors. Inside 
	he found an old Aluvian man and a young Sho woman. They were both seated at 
	a table piled high with books, but they got up quickly and bowed when they 
	saw that the Prince had entered. The young woman seemed vaguely intimidated 
	to be there, but the old man seemed hostile. It also took a moment for 
	Borelean to realize how tall this old man was – he was even taller than most 
	of the burly guards that were stationed around the castle.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Your Highness,&quot; the old man said, with a slight sneer curling his lip. 
	&quot;Thank you for coming so promptly, if a little rudely. It was not necessary 
	for you to rush. You could have stopped to change into fitting garb for an 
	academic setting instead of stomping in here in your smelly armor.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean blinked, unaccustomed to such rebukes. He would have lashed out 
	angrily, but something about the old man's size and sheer willful presence 
	kept him respectful. Tharnoch's lesson about testing your opponent before 
	fully committing to the fight seemed strangely fitting here. He hesitated 
	before speaking, as his gaze lingered briefly on the young woman, but he 
	turned back to the old man and asked, &quot;What would my mother have of me, 
	sir?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I am the mage Harlune, Prince. And this,&quot; he said, motioning to the young 
	woman, &quot;is my student for the moment, Hoshino Kei. Your mother has asked me 
	to include you in young Kei's geomancy lessons.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean looked at Kei again. &quot;We have met once before, have we not, Lady 
	Kei?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Kei nodded and smiled. &quot;I believe so, Your Highness. I was with Master 
	Celdiseth at the time. But please, just call me Kei.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Harlune motioned the Prince to join them at the table. &quot;If you're done 
	flirting, come sit with us, boy.&quot; Kei averted her eyes and seemed to become 
	very interested in the book on the table in front of her.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean tried to summon up as much royal indignance as he could. &quot;I don't 
	know you, sir. Why are you teaching us if the Lady Ciandra is an 
	accomplished mage, and a councilor? What of Master Celdiseth, who was Kei's 
	teacher already?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Harlune's frown deepened, and Borelean thought he saw a flash of blue light 
	in the old man's eyes. &quot;Because you're here to learn about geomancy, the 
	blood witch's apprentice doesn't know as much about ley lines as she does 
	about sacrificing chickens and Celdiseth is a rude, ungrateful bastard. 
	Let's get on with this, so people can stop pestering me to pass on my 
	knowledge. I hear tell you've received some lessons from that ivory tower 
	git from Knorr. And Kei here's learned at least the basics from the blood 
	witch's apprentice. So you won't be completely unprepared for what I need to 
	teach you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Borelean hesitated. He was confused and lost by this sudden shift in his 
	training. &quot;Waiting for me to put a purple satin cushion on your chair for 
	you, boy? I don't have all day,&quot; Harlune growled.<br>
	<br>
	Borelean sighed and approached the table. &quot;Now it seems I am to be a mage,&quot; 
	he said to no one in particular, as he sat down across from Kei.</span></p>

	<p>Welcome to the December Letter to the Players!<br>
	<br>
	Winter is once again upon us and with it comes the changes to the world we 
	see every year. There is snow on the ground and the scarecrows have all gone 
	into hiding as the snowmen have come out to play. The plot thickens as the 
	people of Dereth continue their quest to discover what has happened to 
	Asheron. Will we be able to discover his whereabouts? And what about the 
	Tanada Clan? Will we find out more information about why they are here?<br>
	<br>
	<b>Rare Changes</b><br>
	Based on player feedback Rare Infinite Arrowheads will now work on bundles 
	of the appropriate shafts.<br>
	<br>
	Rare gems are now stackable up to 100<br>
	<br>
	<b>Holiday Fun</b><br>
	Mr.P has decided to make the location of his home known to the players. 
	Perhaps if we are nice enough to him, he may reward us with a new friend.
	<br>
	<br>
	Make sure that you know the location of Frost Haven, there may be a need to 
	travel there in the days ahead.<br>
	<br>
	<b>More Quest Love</b><br>
	A few more quest dungeons have been revised this month. Once again make sure 
	to check out some of your old favorites to see if they have seen some 
	changes. These revised dungeons will also play a part in the current 
	storyline. <br>
	<br>
	Players wishing to continue to gather more information about the Tanada Clan 
	will have an opportunity to get more answers this month. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. Each month we 
	will be discussing one new in concept topic, in order to give you as much 
	information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Squelch Panel</b><br>
	The title pretty much says it all here. In continuing with our theme of 
	updating some older systems in the game we are looking at adding in a 
	squelch panel. The functionality would be similar to that of the friends 
	panel players already have now. We are also looking at increasing the number 
	of players that could be added to the squelch list. One of the ideas of the 
	panel would also be the ability to tell if it is just one character that has 
	been squelched or if it is an entire account. There is still a considerable 
	amount of work that would need to be done on this as we move ahead, but it 
	is something we feel would be a good thing going forward.<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	December and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	December event.</p>
