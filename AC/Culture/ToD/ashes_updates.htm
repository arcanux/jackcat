	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hi there everyone. Let's get right into what's going on 
	today.<br>
	<br>
	The November update Ashes and Dust has gone live and all appears to be well.
	<img border="0" src="ashes/ashes_1.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	We did have one issue to report with the Glenden Wood Recall Orb. It appears 
	that when you use the Orb in a dungeon to recall to Glenden Wood, you get 
	stuck in attack mode and cannot interact with anything or switch weapons.<br>
	<br>
	As it stands right now the only way to resolve being in this state is to 
	relog your character.<br>
	<br>
	As far as we know this is the only issue with the November event.<br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a good night. See you in Dereth!

	<br>
	There is not much to report today. As far as we know at this point the only 
	issue with this month's event has been on the Glenden Wood Recall Orb. As 
	far as we can tell there is an issue when crossing landblock/server 
	boundaries.<br>
	<br>
	In order to give you a better understanding of what happened I have asked 
	Lupus Argenteus to give a more detailed explanation.<br>
	<br>
	That is about it for now. Everyone have a great day!<br>

	<p>Thank you, Frelorn,<br>
	<br>
	After the November update went live, players discovered that the Glenden 
	Wood Recall Orb had a bug where you could not exit casting mode once you had 
	used the recall spell. After research and assistance from players, we 
	identified that it is the act of recalling across a server boundary which 
	results in the bug.<br>
	<br>
	In our test environment, we attempt to simulate the live worlds as closely 
	as possible. However, some factors are unable to be simulated by a test 
	environment. In this instance, our recall tests (we did multiple) all worked 
	successfully, because the character performing the recall happened to be on 
	the same subserver as Glenden Wood due to our test world's load balancing. 
	Some people have pointed out similarities to bugs involving Recall the 
	Sanctuary and Aerlinthe Recall, and after a brief amount of research thus 
	far, the root cause of the GW bug appears to be similar to, but not exactly 
	like, the Sanctuary/Aerlinthe issue.<br>
	<br>
	One thing we strive to do is not to make the same mistake twice. Although in 
	some cases (such as cantrips) we have our issues, overall we have prevented 
	repetition of many serious bugs. This is a test case which we have not in 
	the past thought to perform, but it is very clearly a necessary one. We will 
	be adding it to our repertoire for future use whenever we introduce a new 
	portal or recall spell.<br>

	Over the next few days I am going to attempt to clean up the forums a bit.

	Frelorn</a>)<p>Good afternoon everyone. I hope everyone is having a good day 
	so far.<br>
	<br>
	Not much to talk about today so I will get right to it.<br>
	<br>
	I have started the process of cleaning up the forums a bit. If you noticed, 
	there are a lot less sticky threads now. I have pruned and condensed the 
	ones that I felt didn't need to be on their own anymore. I will be 
	continuing to do this on all of the forums as the days go on.<br>
	<br>
	The daily update threads that I have been doing as of late are going to 
	change. From now on I will be doing a weekly update instead. Unless there is 
	something really important that we need to let you know about. This way it 
	will help the forums stay less cluttered, and you won't have to click on the 
	thread, just to find out there is nothing new for that day.<br>
	<br>
	If this new system of weekly updates doesn’t work out, I can always go back 
	to the daily ones, but I think the weekly updates will be much better for 
	everyone.<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for today. Everyone have a great night.<br>

	Weekly Update</b> -<b> 11/28/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=253783#post253783">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hi there everyone. I hope that everyone had a great weekend. 
	I know I did as I gorged myself on as much Turkey as my body would allow. 
	Since this was a long weekend I figured that on top of the update on what we 
	are doing this week I would answer some of the questions that were brought 
	up. So without further delay, let’s get right to it.<br>
	<br>
	These questions are in no particular order, so don’t put any meaning into 
	the order that I answer them. <br>
	<br>
	<b>When will ToD be an online download with a CD key?</b><br>
	I spoke to our marketing team today about this and the ball is now rolling 
	on getting this done. While you can download the actual game client already, 
	the ability to purchase CD keys online is coming. As soon as I have a solid 
	date, I will let you know. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Why don't monsters level anymore?</b><br>
	This was changed a while back when the skill system was redone. A creature 
	having the ability to level was a side-effect of the old system. When we 
	redid the skill system a long time ago the side-effect was lost. When it was 
	brought up it was decided that due to the fact that some boss creatures 
	could level beyond the player abilities to kill them, it was best to just 
	leave that ability out.<br>
	<br>
	<b>What happened to the Darktide Hardware? Any update on this?</b><br>
	At the time this was announced to the community the makeup and personnel of 
	the team was entirely different, and I wasn’t in on these discussions. I 
	have put the question out to the appropriate members of the staff and as 
	soon as I have an update on this I will let you know. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Will there ever be a Dev chat again?</b><br>
	We would love to do this again. Right now the biggest obstacle for doing 
	something like this is time. The team is very busy and free time is in short 
	supply these days. It is something we would love to do in the not so distant 
	future. With that being said, as soon as we can find the free time to do 
	something like this, we will give you all plenty of notice.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Weekly Update</b><br>
	And finally let’s get to the update for this week. During any cycle we do 
	things can change as new issues or goals come up, so this will be a rough 
	idea of what we have planned for this week without getting too much into the 
	specifics of things.<br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on resolving issues that popped up for 
	December. This is a week that a lot of testing gets done. The team puts in 
	lot of work to make sure that when these events go live, they are as good as 
	they can be. As some of you may know, when you introduce new code into 
	existing code a lot of interesting things can happen, sometimes in 
	unexpected places. So a lot of time is spent checking out everything we can 
	to make sure that there are no surprises when the event goes live. 
	Unfortunately this process isn’t perfect, but we are always trying to find 
	ways to improve on this so that things that have gotten through in the past 
	don’t get through again. The process of working on the January event will 
	also begin this week.<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. As always if anything important comes up we will 
	make sure to update you on it. Have a great day!<br>
	<br>
	<b>Update:</b> In September, we changed the next billing date for 
	subscribers who potentially could be affected by Katrina till Jan 1st 2006.<br>
	For the month of November, however, these customers were charged. We have 
	since refunded these subscribers for the month of November.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Update:</b> Due to popular demand we have decided to extend the date on 
	the migration of accounts until <b>January 10, 2006</b>. After this date, 
	players will no longer be able to migrate old accounts.<br>

	Frelorn, was this discussed in a meeting yet ? </i><br>
	<br>
	Actually, yes it was. We are going to be changing the timers on alot of 
	older quests as well as the new ones to a 27 day timer. Which will 
	effectively mean that when that date comes up the following month, you will 
	know your timers are up and you will be able to do the quest again on a more 
	set schedule.<br>
	<br>
	For the new quests, this change has already begun, as far as older quests go 
	we will let you know what quests are changed and when.<br>

	Weekly Update</b> -<b> 12/05/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=254900#post254900">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hi there everyone. Yes, it’s that time again, time for the 
	weekly update post!<br>
	<br>
	Let’s get right to it then. This week we will be continuing to test and fix 
	any bugs that we come across for the December event, as well as fixing some 
	already existing bugs. The planning for January has also gotten underway. 
	The plans are by no means concrete, but we know the direction we are going, 
	and the design plans are well underway.<br>
	<br>
	Now on to something that I want to try and do every week with these updates, 
	which is to answer a few questions that have come up over the previous week.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Can you make the Ashbane sword from the Dark Lady quest Ivoryable?</b><br>
	I checked with the team on this, and they don’t see a problem with getting 
	this done in a future update. <br>
	<br>
	<b>With all the male mages complaining about that Fiun robe that looks like 
	a dress is there any chance of having two versions of it one for the males 
	(hooded) and one for the females?</b><br>
	This is actually something that was discussed the other day in our meeting. 
	While we didn’t initially have any plans to do this, it may be something 
	that we can take another look at. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events Feedback.</b><br>
	We do appreciate all of the feedback we have gotten from you thus far as we 
	have gone forward with the current story arc. One of things that was brought 
	up was posting a schedule online somewhere so that players know when to log 
	in so they can participate. We are actually a bit divided on this topic. On 
	one hand we understand that everyone who is interested in these events would 
	like the option to know when these events are taking place, so they can try 
	to be there. On the other hand, one of the wonderful things about Dereth is 
	that you never know when something interesting might happen. <br>
	<br>
	That being said, we will be re-evaluating how we handle things the next time 
	we want to push the story forward with live events. <br>
	<br>
	And finally I just wanted to give you all a heads up that some time tomorrow 
	we will be posting an announcement about the AC1 team. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Please keep an eye out for that announcement 
	tomorrow. Everyone have a great week!<br>

	Changes to the AC1 team.</b> -<b> 12/06/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=255013#post255013">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hi there everyone. As stated yesterday in the daily update, 
	we have some exciting news about the AC1 team, so let’s get right to it.<br>
	<br>
	The first thing we would like to announce is that our very own Dave 
	“Crowley” Javier has been named the new Producer for AC1. As many of you 
	know, when Calandryll agreed to take over the job, it was on a temporary 
	basis until things calmed down a bit. Well, things have calmed down and Dave 
	has graciously agreed to take over in this key role for us. <br>
	What does that mean for AC? I will let him explain that in his own words. He 
	will be posting on this thread shortly just to briefly re-introduce himself 
	to you.<br>
	<br>
	The other announcement is that we have filled the once available content 
	design position for AC1. Without further delay, I would like to announce 
	that the new content designer is our very own Eric “Kintani” Deans. Eric has 
	been here for a while now as a QA associate on ToD, DDO, and more recently 
	the AC1 live team. We feel his experience in gaming will be a great addition 
	to the team. Eric will also be posting in this thread to introduce himself 
	to the community. <br>
	<br>
	This is an exciting time to be part of Asheron’s Call, and we are all 
	looking forward to the future and what we can bring to the game. <br>
	<br>
	Thanks everyone. See you in Dereth!<br>

	Crowley</a>)<p>Hey everyone,<br>
	<br>
	As Frelorn said, I've moved into a new role on the AC Live team. I've 
	accepted the position of AC Live Team Producer. I’ll also continue to 
	contribute to the team's content and design work. Personally and 
	professionally, I feel like I've finally settled down after the tumult of 
	the move back from LA to Boston (I finally got Internet and satellite TV at 
	my apartment!). In this new role, I'm planning to stake a more public 
	presence on the boards as the team moves forward with our beloved game. As 
	I've mentioned in the past, I've got a long track record with AC and the AC 
	franchise, dating back to the original incarnation of the Live team in 1999.<br>
	<br>
	I’m excited for the future possibilities with Asheron's Call. I hope you're 
	all enjoying the game, and I look forward to working with you all on our 
	future development.<br>
	<br>
	Cheers,<br>

	Kintani</a>)<p>Allo everyone,<br>
	<br>
	My name is Eric, or Kintani, if you prefer chat handles, and I've been asked 
	to come here and introduce myself and explain a little about my past and my 
	experiences. Up until my recent position of Designer on AC1, I worked at 
	Turbine as QA on the AC:ToD Expansion Pack, as well as on the D&amp;D Online 
	project. I have some skill as an Artist, having worked as a Web Designer and 
	a 3D Modeler in the past. I've been gaming, in one form or another, for a 
	little over 20 years, including most of the popular Tabletop games, MMO's, 
	and PC Games.<br>
	<br>
	As for my experiences with Asheron's Call, I've played the game since it was 
	first released in 1999. During this time, I served as an Advocate for a 
	little over a year, and have tried my hand at many, if not all, of the 
	aspects AC has to offer. I've played most of the popular and not-so-popular 
	templates, tried my hand at Darktide, and run through most of the quests in 
	the game.<br>
	<br>
	I hope to bring my experiences and skills to bear to add to this game, as 
	well as to bring enjoyment to all of you, the players. Without you all, 
	there wouldn't be any game.<br>

	<p>Tough to choose a favorite... let me choose three. <br>
	<br>
	I thought the December 2000 patch was awesome. That's when Bael'Zharon got 
	to run amok, and I got to play BZ a few times! I terrorized Hebian and Ayan 
	Baqur. It was also pretty stunning to see the gathered mass of the Bloods on 
	Darktide kneeling to Bael'Zharon, and seeing these hard-core PK players 
	telling each other to be respectful. No, I wasn't playing BZ for that one, 
	but I was watching.<br>
	<br>
	I thought the Tusker Island patch in November 2002 was awesome for the broad 
	range of content it offered, and the many quirky and clever details about 
	the island. How can you resist the nanners?<br>
	<br>
	I liked this year's August patch because I think we leveraged our extra dev 
	time into a pretty astounding amount of content and changes that hit all 
	over the world. And because I really like Grael (one of meanbeard's ideas), 
	and that's when the legend of Grael was introduced.<br>
	<br>
	I don't know that it's a good idea for me to comment on patches I disliked, 
	sorry. Too many people have put in too much toil, time, and effort on each 
	and every patch for me to casually toss judgment on one or two.<br>

	Favorite Quests</b> -<b> 12/07/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=255259#post255259">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>So I was talking with the team a bit earlier, and the subject 
	of our favorite quests came up. So then the idea came to us... Let's ask the 
	players what thier favorites were/are. <br>
	<br>
	So here is the question. What are your favorite quests and why? Perhaps a 
	top 10 list. This is more out of curiosity than anything, but it will also 
	give us an idea of where you the players would like to see things go. <br>
	<br>
	So I will start out with my favorite quests that are in the game right now.<br>
	<br>
	1. Aerlinthe<br>
	2. Gaerlan<br>
	3. Any of the Ancient Temple quests.(I love the jumps, I am a glutton for 
	punishment)<br>
	4. Bobo<br>
	5. Sword of Lost Light(Just really cool)<br>
	6. Atlan Stone Tool<br>
	7. Focus Stone<br>
	8. Green Mire Grave(I still remember my days as a noob fearing this quest)<br>
	9. Queens quest<br>
	10. Shadow Captain's Heaume( This was one that my allegiance did alot. I 
	loved the dynamic of havin 2 different level groups being need to complete 
	the quest. It made it so everyone was involved.)<br>
	<br>
	So there is my list, what quests would be on yours?<br>

	Crowley</a>)<p>I can't really name favorites, as it almost feels like a 
	conflict of interest to pick a favorite quest, in a way that picking a 
	favorite update isn't...<br>
	<br>
	I do have fond memories of the times, back in the early days, when I used to 
	sit on the other side of the locked door in Green Mire and asked people to 
	tell me knock-knock jokes to open the door for them. The best response I got 
	was this one:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Knock knock.&quot;<br>
	&quot;Who's there?&quot;<br>
	&quot;My corpse.&quot;<br>
	&quot;My corpse who?&quot;<br>
	&quot;My corpse who's stuck on the other side of the door, now open up!&quot;<br>

	Weekly Update</b> -<b> 12/13/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=256314#post256314">by 
	Frelorn</a>)
	<p>Hi there everyone, sorry that this update is a day late, we had a couple 
	members of the team out sick yesterday. Anyway, let’s get right into this 
	weeks update.<br>
	<br>
	<b>When will you guys fix the hotkey bug?</b><br>
	We have good news on this pesky bug. We have fixed this bug for the December 
	update. <br>
	<br>
	<b>When is the December event going to happen?</b><br>
	Right now we are scheduled to have the event take place on Tuesday, December 
	20th. <br>
	<br>
	<b>When will we see the Letter to the Players?</b><br>
	My plan is to have this out to you this Friday, the 16th. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Will the Spec/Unspec quest changes be implemented in December?</b><br>
	Yes they will be. <br>
	<br>
	Now onto what we have planned and what we are doing this week. Our QA team 
	will be continuing to check out the December event for any issues that might 
	occur. The live team is also very busy getting things done for the January 
	event. This includes the first stages of implementation and testing as well 
	as putting the finishing touches on the design specs. As for me, I will be 
	working on the Letter to the Players and all things associated with the 
	launch of the December event. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. I hope everyone has a great week!<br>
