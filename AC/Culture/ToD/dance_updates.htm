    Hello there and welcome to the October 16th edition of the Asheron’s Call 
	weekly update. <br>
	<br>
	This week we have some exciting news for everyone. We are going to be using 
	this opportunity to introduce you all to our new Senior Game Engineer, 
	Severlin! He comes to us with an enormous amount of engineering experience, 
	and a fresh outlook on what can be done with Asheron’s Call. In this thread, 
	Severlin is going to briefly introduce himself to everyone, and say hello. 
	Make sure we all give him a warm welcome. We don’t want to scare him away 
	before he can really dig into things, so go easy on him. <br>
	<br>
	We are all very excited about things to come with the Addition of Severlin 
	to the team. As time goes on and he becomes more accustomed to this 
	community and the job in general, I am sure we will see more of him here. 
	For now we don’t want to distract him too much. He will be concentrating on 
	getting himself up to speed with all the inner workings of Asheron’s Call. 
	This is no easy task, to say the least. <br>
	<br>
	Other than helping our newest addition to the team get up to speed, the rest 
	of the team is working on the November update. At this stage we are getting 
	things implemented and the testing/balance process has already begun. I must 
	say, so far things are looking really good from what I’ve seen. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Once again make sure to welcome Severlin to the 
	team. He is looking forward to becoming a valued member of the community.<br>

    Greetings,<br>
	<br>
	I wanted to write a quick post to introduce myself. My name is Rob and I 
	have joined the AC team as a senior games engineer. If I was a better person 
	I would have a witty post of introduction to endear myself to the community, 
	but I am not that cool. Instead, I will tell you I am extremely excited to 
	be here and make this great game even better. I will be poking my nose into 
	the forums when I am not buried in code. I am looking forward to seeing you 
	all online in game and on the forums!<br>

    Hello there and welcome to the October 23rd edition of the Asheron’s Call 
	Weekly Update!<br>
	<br>
	We would like to start out by thanking everyone for giving Severlin a warm 
	welcome to the team. He is still getting used to his new surroundings and 
	getting up to speed on the game code, so he has been a very busy person this 
	last week. I am sure we will hear more from him here on the forums as he 
	gets more comfortable in his new role. He has already brought up some 
	exciting ideas for things he would like to do in the future. <br>
	<br>
	So we had a chance to try out some new toys over the last couple of weeks 
	here, so I took the opportunity to make my first attempt at an official 
	Asheron’s Call Screensaver. You can download a version with or without 
	sound. The version with sound comes with the music that has graced most of 
	our videos in the past, “Excalibur”. Both versions run the same images, so 
	it is a matter of preference if you want sound or not. This was my first 
	attempt at creating a screensaver so your feedback is welcome. The more I 
	know about what folks want, the better the next one will be.
	<a target="_blank" href="http://download.turbine.com/ac1/AC1Screensaver.exe">
	Click here</a> if you want the version with sound,
	<a target="_blank" href="http://download.turbine.com/ac1/AC1ScreensaverNS.exe">
	click here</a> if you want the version without sound. Enjoy!<br>
	<br>
	As much as I would like to, I cannot give away any clues about the November 
	event yet. What I can do is give you a
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=494">sneak peek</a> 
	at one of the new heritage masks that will be available in the November 
	event. That will just have to hold everyone over until we can give you some 
	more information. <br>
	<br>
	That’s it for this week. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

    Hello there and welcome to the October 30th edition of the weekly update.
	<br>
	<br>
	This week’s update is going to be a short one due to the fact it is our 
	annual Halloween event here in the Turbine offices. Every department does 
	some decorating of their area in preparation for the children of employees 
	coming in for some Halloween fun. Many of us get in costume and just have a 
	good time. Needless to say, this can be a bit distracting at times. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on fixing any issues that may still remain in 
	the November event, Remembering the Past, tentatively scheduled to go live 
	on November 14th. At this point all the content is done and is being tested 
	and fixed as things are found. <br>
	<br>
	As I am sure you can guess we are all excited about the upcoming free trial. 
	This is something we have been working on getting done for some time now, 
	and we think that along with the full page add in PC Gamer, we should be 
	seeing some new players coming into the world of Dereth very soon. We know 
	there are quite a few questions surrounding the upcoming trial, and those 
	questions will be answered in short order once the trial is live and ready 
	to go. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

    <b><span lang="en-us"><a name="8"></a>What If? Housing Barriers - 10/30/06 </span></b>(<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=317216#post317216">by 
	<span lang="en-us">Severlin</span></a>)<p>
    For everyone who has been following the boards, the housing barriers on the 
	PvP server are a big source of discussion. This is also an topic within our 
	group, and we have been discussing some (hopefully) cool ideas if the 
	housing barriers can be reasonably changed. Before I go off and spend a lot 
	of time investigating the tech needed to modify how housing barriers can be 
	tweaked the team wanted to get some preliminary feedback here.<br>
	<br>
	Now, we are taking a big chance here. We want to solicit feedback, but we 
	also want to make sure people know that this stuff is not scheduled nor 
	promised. If we post preliminary ideas here occasionally we can work with 
	the players, but if we get burned on this I won't be able to put up 
	preliminary thoughts anymore. Just so you folks understand my position. 
	Also, some things we will keep super secret. We also want to surprise 
	players with some features and content, so we certainly wouldn't be doing 
	this all the time. Players shouldn't have that expectation.<br>
	<br>
	On to the fun stuff...<br>
	<br>
	The team is discussing two changes to the housing barriers on PvP servers, 
	which at this point means Darktide.<br>
	<br>
	First, Turbine might consider holding all out PvP madness nights 
	occasionally where the housing barriers come down and people can raid as 
	they wish. These events would be scheduled and it is even possible they 
	would be run as a live event. Something in the game world would force the 
	barriers down and from there, well you can imagine.<br>
	<br>
	Second, there could potentially be an uncommon drop of a special key (if I 
	can implement the tech in a reasonable amount of time) on PvP servers. With 
	this key a character with maxed lockpicking could use it to drop a housing 
	barrier for some amount of time. Times we are discussing would be 10 
	minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour. The frequency of this drop is still under 
	discussion.<br>
	<br>
	This would provide Dark Tide people with times where the people who prefer 
	to PvP without housing barriers could do so, and no one would be absolutely 
	safe.<br>
	<br>
	First, do players find prelimary postings useful even though we might not be 
	able to implement the tech? Second, would these systems be fun for PvPers?<br>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Good question.<br>
	<br>
	One of the things I find cool about AC is allegiances. It really is a unique 
	feature for the game, and we want to encourage them. One thing an allegiance 
	can do for its members is provide buff bot and mules in their housing that 
	can benefit their members. With full out removal of housing barriers 24/7 
	our concern is that these subsystems would be quickly devastated by constant 
	death and we would actually reduce the usefulness of allegiances and housing 
	on PvP servers. This runs contrary to our goals of making allegiances even 
	more cool.<br>
	<br>
	Another problem with housing and PvP is that there is a huge advantage to 
	attackers in a game like AC simply because allegiances cannot be on all the 
	time to protect their housing. It is, quite frankly, trivial to schedule 
	raids when an allegiance is short staffed, making the raid less fun. If we 
	have a scheduled night for PvP then we maximize the chance that the players 
	can get on all their friends and the raids will rock the house because it is 
	far more likely that offense and defense will be balanced.<br>
	<br>
	Does that make sense?<div>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Our worry is that the situation would be exactly as it is today, except 
	that the basement would be proof against PvP. Yes, it opens up the other 
	parts for combat, but it doesn't actually change the situation. Of concern 
	is if people were safe in the housing before they could simply move to the 
	basement and nothing much would change.<div>

	<p>If people want to be able to occasionally break the barriers and raid 
	during off times they have to want it enough to increase their lock picking. 
	Otherwise they would raid on Mayhem Night when the barriers go down.<br>
	<br>
	Plus it makes lockpicking useful. Only one allegiance member would have to 
	maintain the skill to use the keys...<br>

	<p>Really want to hose a rival guild? Save your keys and use them in 
	succession to nail them. That's the idea. A lot of the trick is making the 
	keys drop just enough to make this fun. But you can't just randomly make 
	existance miserable for *all* buff bots and mules. You have to &quot;want&quot; it. 
	That's the balance we are looking for.<blockquote>

	<p>This thread is one step to determine exactly what DT *has* been begging 
	for. Do a majority of players share your views? Maybe. I am not saying a 
	single thread will be the end all - be all of finding out what PvP players 
	ultimately want, but this is exactly the type of feedback we are trying to 
	solicit.<br>

	</blockquote>
	<p>I prefer a reward solution rather than a punishment solution. I would 
	instead envision each mansion having a banner. If an allegiance grabs a 
	rival banner the entire allegiance that is online gets XP. If the allegiance 
	defends their banner successfully during Mayhem Night then *they* would get 
	the XP. But now we are going into design elements I haven't discussed with 
	the team and these might not be possible without serious tech.<br>
	<br>
	The stuff we are talking about, however, is not designed to be the solution 
	to cool land control based PvP. It is designed to reward and encourage PvP 
	in a manner that maximizes both fun and the chance that players can engage 
	in satisfying interplayer conflict.<br>

	This week we are going to address one of the issues most discussed on this 
	forum over the last few months, the pre-order gem. <br>
	<br>
	After much debate from the community as well as internally here in the 
	office we have come to a decision we feel is optimal given the situation. 
	Starting in the November event players will be able to get a new 
	augmentation which will grant them an 8% health bonus for 24 hours upon use. 
	Getting this augmentation will give players a gem in their inventory similar 
	to the pre-order gem some players already have. The cost of getting this gem 
	will be 2 billion experience and the gems effect will NOT stack with the 
	Asheron’s Benediction gem that those who did pre-order have in their 
	inventory. We feel this is the best solution to an issue which has stirred 
	up debate for quite some time now. <br>
	<br>
	Remember that this upcoming Friday the November Letter to the Players and 
	new Event fiction will be released. This month is going to mark the 
	beginning of the latest story arc in Asheron’s Call. What does the future 
	hold for Dereth in the coming months?<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week, everyone have a great day and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

    During our testing of the November event a small issue was found that 
	requires some extra attention to fix. In order to make sure this is done 
	correctly we have decided to change patch day from Tuesday the 14th to 
	Thursday the 16th of November. This will allow us enough time to make sure 
	that the fixes going in to the game are sufficiently tested by the team and 
	our QA department. <br>
	<br>
	The new downtime window for the November event is Thursday November 16, 8am 
	- 3pm EST.<br>

    Hello there and welcome to the November 13th edition of the weekly update.
	<br>
	<br>
	As many of you know the Asheron’s Call free trial site was live over this 
	past weekend. Unfortunately we had to bring the site live before originally 
	planned and before all of the development support was ready. This allowed 
	some players to possibly abuse trial accounts in an unintended manner.<br>
	<br>
	The positive side of this is we have information for those people and we 
	will be checking the system based on the information we have. Anyone found 
	to have exploited the system by gathering either rank chains or excess 
	housing may be subject to a ban across all of their accounts, both trial and 
	existing accounts. This will mean any accounts associated with trial 
	accounts caught abusing the system could be banned. If you are a player who 
	used the trial in a legitimate manner, you will not need to worry about any 
	type of repercussions with your account. <br>
	<br>
	We had hoped it would not come down to this, but some players felt the need 
	to once again try to gain advantages over other players. This trial is meant 
	to re-energize AC and this kind of behavior only serves to hurt the game and 
	the community. <br>
	<br>
	When the Free Trial officially goes live there will be restrictions in place 
	that will prevent this from being an issue. Until this system is in place we 
	will be monitoring all account transactions related to the free trial for 
	abuse. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	The November event, Remembering the past is tentatively going live this 
	Thursday, the 16th. All worlds will be down from 8am – 3pm EST and players 
	will not be able to log in to the game. Make sure to check out the various 
	fan sites for the tease images related to the November event, and check out 
	the Remembering the Past event page. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Have a great day and see you all in Dereth!<br>

    Things are still in the concept phase, but the implementation will be 
	dependent on what quest information is available to the game. Quests with 
	flags are easier, as are quests with timers. It's all those quests that 
	don't give these that become the design issue.<br>
	<br>
	With the number of quests in the game we have to be careful about a tracker 
	that requires information added to the quests because any decision to do 
	that requires lots of changes and the QA to retest every quest we ever put 
	into the game would be... non-trivial. <br>
	<br>
	The quest tracker has two design goals. One is to let players track which 
	quests they have encountered so they can see what they are doing. Another 
	goal is to give the players a summary of the quests they can pursue at a 
	particular level. The team believes that many players don't realize the 
	large amount of quests actually available. If we do something that shows all 
	quests then we would have to decide how hard it will be to have &quot;hidden&quot; 
	quests that only appear on the tracker if you find them.<br>

	As many of you know already we had decided to delay the November patch for a 
	few days in order to make sure some issues we ran into were resolved. Well, 
	as it stands today these issues have not yet been resolved. Rather than 
	releasing the patch with some things we are not happy with, we have decided 
	to delay the patch until November 21st. This was not an easy decision for 
	us, but we would rather delay things by a few more days rather than release 
	a patch with possible issues. If there are any other schedule changes we 
	will be sure to let everyone know.<br>

    Hello there and welcome to the November 20th edition of the Asheron’s Call 
	Weekly Update!<br>
	<br>
	The November event, Remembering the Past will be launching tomorrow November 
	21st. Please remember that all worlds will be down from 8am – 3pm EST. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on implementing some of the things for the 
	December event. That means they get to see how they look in a game 
	environment, and how they work. We then begin making the appropriate changes 
	to these quests and items to bring them in line with what the initial vision 
	for the particular item or quest is supposed to be.<br>
	<br>
	Much to my surprise today we had a visit from one of our oldest friends here 
	at Turbine, Kwip. He and his wife came by to say hello to some old friends 
	and to hand out some jerky to some of the staff. For many it was nice to see 
	them in for a visit, and for me it was finally nice to meet him and his 
	wife. You can check out Kwip’s work over at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.neenerneener.net/">
	http://www.neenerneener.net</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, this is a reminder that most of us here will be having a long 
	weekend this week to celebrate the Thanksgiving Holiday. Customer service 
	will still be working during the time the rest of us are off. Billing and 
	technical support hours will be as follows: <br>
	<br>
	Account &amp; Technical Support will be closed in observation of the 
	Thanksgiving Day Holiday, Thursday November 23rd, 2006.<br>
	<br>
	Account &amp; Technical Support will be available Friday November 24th, via live 
	chat and email. Account Management phone support will be closed. Please plan 
	accordingly.<br>
	<br>
	Both departments will re-open on Monday November 27th during the regular 
	business hours of 12pm-9pm EST. Phone, email, and live chat services will be 
	available.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for this week. Everyone have a great week and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>
