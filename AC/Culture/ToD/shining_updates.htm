	Hello there everyone. I hope we all had a great weekend. In case some of you 
	are wondering why this update is coming out on a Tuesday, it is due to 
	Monday having been a holiday here. Let’s get right on to things.<br>
	<br>
	The first of our scheduled and unscheduled Live Ops have begun on many of 
	the worlds. We have seen some good turnouts for these events, and hopefully 
	we will continue to see more and more of you show up and join in the 
	activities. <br>
	<br>
	We would also like to announce that we have a new fan-site added to the list 
	of sites that will be getting the latest news and teaser images from us. We 
	are happy to announce that
	<a target="_blank" href="http://acheaven.buwahaha.com/">Sucamarto's AC 
	Heaven</a> is now a part of our fan-site family. They will be getting teaser 
	images and news as other fan-sites have been. We are excited about adding 
	yet another resource for us to be able to get information out to you the 
	players. You can check out some of our fan-sites on
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=369">this</a> page.
	<br>
	<br>
	One thing that has come up a lot lately is bot’s in the main room of the 
	Marketplace. After discussing things with the team, we have decided that ALL 
	bots should now stay out of the main room of the Marketplace. If a bot is 
	found to be in the main room, they will be moved by customer service. If the 
	same bot is then continually found in the main room, they may be subject to 
	removal from the Marketplace until they can be contacted by customer 
	support. Our hope is that this will help those people who are sometimes 
	having issues portaling into the Marketplace. <br>
	<br>
	Finally, we just want to put out the reminder to join us tonight at 7pm EST 
	for a live Developer’s chat. You can get all the information on this event
	<a target="_blank" href="http://acvault.ign.com/static.php?page=april2006devchat">
	here</a> . We are looking forward to seeing and hearing from as many of you 
	as possible. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for today. Everyone have a great week, and see you all in 
	Dereth!<br>

	by the Vault</a>)</p>
	<p>Join us for a chat with the AC1 Dev Team! <br>
	<br>
	When: April 18, 2006, 7 PM EST<br>
	Where: irc.us.gamesurge.net Channel: #ac1 <br>
	<br>
	This is the first AC1 Dev Chat in many months. Come pick the brains of the 
	developers! <br>
	<br>
	The AC1 team will answer general questions about the game, with the emphasis 
	being on these general questions, not the April event. <br>
	<br>
	Ten minutes before the chat starts, I will ask for people to PM me on IRC if 
	they wish to ask the question. I will build a list from those to PM me. We 
	will use this list to determine the order in which questions will be asked 
	during the chat. This will be on a first come first serve basis. <br>
	<br>
	When it is time for the next person on the list to ask their question, they 
	will be allowed to do so. Once the person asks their question, they will no 
	longer be able to speak in the chat room. This process will continue for the 
	remainder of the chat. <br>
	<br>
	To connect to the chat room, you can use a free IRC client such as
	<a target="_blank" href="http://mirc.com/">mIRC</a>. <br>
	<br>
	Alternatively, you can use our
	<a target="_blank" href="http://acvault.ign.com/community/chat/">web-based 
	IRC chat client</a>. <br>
	<br>
	Hope to see you there!</p>

	Spring is in the air, birds are singing, flowers are budding, the snow has 
	melted – which can only mean one thing, it’s time for the annual MS Walk in 
	Lancaster, Pennsylvania on April 23rd!<br>
	<br>
	A group of Turbies including LOTRO’s Vice-Cardinal Nik “MithrilMiser” 
	Davidson, DDO’s Genius Child-Thing Jesse “devilmouse” Kurlancheek, Heather 
	Sinclair and AC1’s Pontifex-Yokozuna Dave &quot;Crowley&quot; Javier will be piling 
	into a car and making the the 7 hour long drive to join our friend and 
	longtime Turbine fan Shawn “Kwip” Williams on team NeenerNeener.net!<br>
	<br>
	It’s a good cause and a lot of fun. I have also put in a request that 
	pictures from the event be brought back so we can have some good laughs. If 
	you are in the area you can just show up, or if you want more information

	Frelorn</a>)<p>Hello there everyone. Let’s get right into this weeks update.<br>
	<br>
	I wanted to start this week with an update on the CD Keys/Digital 
	Distribution situation. Let me reiterate that we want these keys out as fast 
	as we can get them out. After much internal debate over the last week or so 
	(office speak for a lot of meetings) the issue has been placed at the top of 
	the priority list. This means that alot sooner rather than later this issue 
	will be fixed. This time I will not give an ETA, but I will say that my 
	confidence that this issue is going to get resolved quickly is very high. 
	This is the way I like to start off my week, things are getting done.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="smile" alt="" src="shining/smile.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	Now lets move on to some other things that are happening this week in 
	Asheron’s Call. <br>
	<br>
	The live events have been continuing on schedule. We have been reading your 
	feedback and doing some adjustments on the fly. Overall the feedback on 
	these events has been positive, and it seems we have a lot of players 
	choosing sides, and taking their choices very seriously. Look for these 
	events to continue and evolve as time goes on. We are already planning some 
	more fun events for the future. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is busily working on the content for the May event. We 
	are already at the point where most of the content has been loaded on our 
	internal test world, and the team is now working on getting things to where 
	they want them to be. This includes creature balance, NPC/Dungeon locations, 
	lore details and more. This is what we consider one of the busier weeks in 
	the development cycle. <br>
	<br>
	Finally, we want to let you know that next week we will be posting a much 
	more detailed description of the upcoming Allegiance Improvements that were 
	hinted at in the last Letter to the Players. Our goal with these changes is 
	to make the experience of being in an allegiance, a more memorable one. 
	Monarchs, do you want to give more power to your allegiance officers? Done. 
	Want to give your Monarchy its own unique name? Done. Those features are 
	just a hint at what is coming for allegiances in the May event. We will have 
	more for you next week. <br>
	<br>
	That’s about it for now. Everyone have a great day and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	<b><a name="5"></a>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 5/1/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbine.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=281969#post281969">by 
	Frelorn</a>)<p>
	Hi there everyone. I hope we all had a good weekend. We got to see some 
	interesting developments in the battle between Varicci and Elysa over the 
	past week. Things appear to be getting interesting in Dereth. I wonder what 
	might happen next.<br>
	<br>
	As promised, this week I am going to go over all of the allegiance 
	improvements in detail with you this week. There is alot to cover, so let’s 
	get right into it. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Names</b><br>
	The first aspect of the improvements we will cover today is the ability to 
	give your allegiance its own unique name. The monarch of the allegiance or 
	an officer with the appropriate permissions may set the name of the 
	allegiance once every 24 hours using the command @allegiance name set 
	&lt;name&gt;. The name of the allegiance may be changed once every 24 hours, by a 
	person with the appropriate permissions, which we will cover more in the 
	allegiance officers section of this report. Allegiance names may be 40 
	characters long and may consist only of characters that can be used in 
	character names: that is, alphabetic characters, spaces, and normal 
	punctuation only (‘ and -).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Officers</b><br>
	For some time now players have been asking us for more structure and control 
	over what goes on in allegiances. These requests include giving allegiance 
	officers more abilities and a better system then what had been in place. 
	Well, ask and you shall receive! Below I will list the officer ranks and the 
	powers that go along with them. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 1: </b>Speaker<br>
	Allegiance chat kick.<br>
	Allegiance chat gag.<br>
	Allegiance broadcast.<br>
	Set/clear the MOTD.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 2: </b>Seneschal<br>
	Promote/demote members under own rank <br>
	(i.e. can promote/demote speakers). <br>
	Allegiance boot. <br>
	Allegiance ban. <br>
	Access allegiance info.<br>
	Lock/unlock the allegiance.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 3:</b> Castellan<br>
	Promote/demote members to any rank, including other Castellans.<br>
	Change officer titles.<br>
	Set/clear the allegiance name. <br>
	Set allegiance bind stone. <br>
	Change mansion allegiance access/storage permissions. <br>
	Bypass allegiance lock with own vassals. <br>
	Bypass allegiance lock by approving particular vassals.<br>
	<br>
	The monarch and officers with appropriate permissions can appoint officers 
	or remove officers as described in the table above. In other words: <br>
	<br>
	• The monarch can appoint or remove any officer of any level.<br>
	• Castellan (level 1) officers can appoint or remove any officer of any 
	level.<br>
	• Seneschal (level 2) officers can appoint or remove Speakers. <br>
	• Speaker (level 3) officers cannot appoint or remove anyone at this time.
	<br>
	<br>
	Any member of the allegiance may become an officer. An allegiance may have a 
	maximum of 12 officers at once (not counting the monarch, who is not 
	considered an officer), but those 12 officers may have any level of 
	permission. For instance, there may be 12 speakers, or 6 speakers and 6 
	seneschals, or what have you. <br>
	<br>
	In addition, at any time a member of the allegiance can find out who the 
	officers of that allegiance are by typing in the command @allegiance officer 
	or @allegiance officer list.<br>
	Either command will display a list of allegiance member names in no 
	particular order followed by their officer title.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Custom Officer Titles<br>
	</b>In order to help customize allegiances, the monarch and officers with 
	appropriate permissions can rename the officer levels in whatever fashion 
	they desire – so long as those names meet the following two criteria:<br>
	• The new title must be no longer than 20 characters. <br>
	• The new title must consist alphabetic characters and normal punctuation 
	(namely ‘ and -) only.<br>
	• The new title must not be profane, as determined by the chat language 
	filter. <br>
	<br>
	Note that officer titles may contain spaces and capital letters. If an 
	allegiance has not set a custom name for an officer level, the default title 
	is used.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Chat Gag<br>
	</b>As you may have noticed, there are some abilities listed above that were 
	not available before. One of these is the allegiance chat gag. The monarch 
	or any officer of Speaker level or above may temporarily prevent any 
	allegiance member from participating in allegiance chat by entering a 
	command. By default, this gag will last 5 minutes and then wear off. An 
	officer or the monarch may explicitly end this gag early, if they so choose. 
	Note that officers may gag each other or even the monarch, but that a gagged 
	officer can always just turn around and ungag himself immediately. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Lock<br>
	</b>Another ability that was once not available is the ability to lock an 
	allegiance. The monarch of the allegiance or an officer with the appropriate 
	permissions may lock or unlock the allegiance. In addition, any member of 
	the allegiance can see the current state by entering in a command. 
	Allegiances are unlocked by default, to match existing behavior. When the 
	allegiance is unlocked, new players may swear into the allegiance in the 
	normal fashion. When the allegiance is locked, however, only the monarch and 
	officers with the appropriate permissions may accept offers of allegiance. 
	If a player swears allegiance to a monarch or Castellan-level officer in a 
	locked allegiance, the action proceeds as normal. But if a player attempts 
	to swear allegiance to a lower-level officer or non-officer in a locked 
	allegiance, then the swear attempt will fail. <br>
	<br>
	There you have it. The allegiance improvements going in for the May event In 
	the May Letter to the Players we will give a more expanded listing of the 
	commands that go along with these changes. <br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a great week and see you in Dereth!<br>

	<b><a name="6"></a>Weekly Update </b>-<b> 5/8/06</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=283184#post283184">by

	Hello there everyone. I hope you all had a good weekend. Let’s get right 
	into this weeks update. <br>
	<br>
	This week the team is working on getting all of the little things done to 
	the content that is going in for May. This includes fixing any bugs that may 
	be in the new content, and balancing the creatures for their intended level 
	groups. Part of this process is having what we call “play days”. These are 
	set times where we take our characters and run through the new quests and 
	features. This is where we tend to figure out balancing for the quests. If a 
	bunch of us run in and get killed too fast, we turn it down a bit. If we 
	blow through the quest, it’s time to make it a bit harder. Either way it’s a 
	great opportunity for us to check out each others work. <br>
	<br>
	This is also the week in the development cycle that the team has to have all 
	of their internal documentation completed for the June event. We have 
	already had the meeting where it is decided what specific quests will be 
	going in to the game, and how the quests will help advance the story line. 
	Those meetings are usually the ones I look forward to the most. Some of the 
	strangest ideas can come out of these meetings and some of the best ones as 
	well, as we hope you will see in the coming months.<br>
	<br>
	With all the hype and excitement of E3 coming up, a large portion of the 
	Turbine staff is either in LA already, or on their way. Unfortunately for me 
	my wife had other plans so I don’t get to make the trip this year.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="frown" alt="" src="shining/frown.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"> 
	I am looking forward to some good updates from the many Turbinites who will 
	be there wandering the halls. We may even have a few surprises coming out of 
	this year’s event. You will just have to wait and see. <br>
	<br>
	That is about it for now. It is one of those weeks where there is not a ton 
	to report on. Things are going well, and we are looking forward to the May 
	event, <i>The Price of Loyalty</i>. Once we know all of the testing is done 
	and everything is ready, I will officially announce the date of the event.
	<br>
	<br>
	Everyone have a great day, and see you all in Dereth!<br>

	Frelorn</a>)<p>
	Hi there from all of us here in wonderful underwater New England! I hope you 
	have all had a safe and dry weekend. <br>
	<br>
	So this week I have chosen to pick out a couple of questions that seem to 
	come up alot on the forums these days. <br>
	<br>
	<b>What is the deal with the Pre- Order gems?</b><br>
	So having seen this one come up alot I wanted to make things as clear as 
	possible. There are no plans to allow people who still have existing codes 
	to enter them now. Players were given plenty of notice that the program was 
	coming to an end. <br>
	<br>
	That being said, we are discussing ways we can make something similar 
	available to players, while at the same time not alienating those people who 
	were able to enter their keys before the program ended. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Where is the high level outdoor hunting you promised us? </b><br>
	In spite of what some have said in the past few weeks, this is till 
	something on the radar. Perhaps it is something that is going to be tied 
	into the story line.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="wink" alt="" src="shining/wink.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	<b>Will there be more Live Events coming in May?</b><br>
	I don’t really want to give away too much information before the May event 
	goes live. What I will say is that when/if we do more events of this nature 
	a schedule will be posted. We saw that people liked knowing when some events 
	were happening, and they also like the spontaneous events. We are still 
	talking about some of the things we saw during these events. The players 
	ability to react and change with the theme of what is happening, is pretty 
	amazing sometimes. <br>
	<br>
	I can say with all honesty that running some of those events was the most 
	fun we have had in some time. We look forward to more of them in the future.
	<img class="inlineimg" title="big grin" alt="" src="shining/biggrin.gif" border="0" width="16" height="16"><br>
	<br>
	<b>What is in the future for Asheron’s Call?</b><br>
	I can tell you that this is an exciting time to be a part of Asheron’s Call. 
	We have some great things in store for everyone in the coming weeks and 
	months. From things that players have been asking for, to a few surprises 
	that have been needed for a long time, in game and out. When the time comes 
	for all of this information to come out (and that time is right around the 
	corner), we will be making sure everyone knows about it. I am truly excited 
	about the future of Asheron’s Call.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Well that's about it for now. When there is more news on anything, as always 
	I will let everyone know. Have a great day and see you all in Dereth!<br>
