    As the festival season approaches, some interesting changes are coming to 
	Dereth. The town of Glenden Wood is gearing up for a big celebration this 
	year. They are really in the holiday spirit and there are rumors that one of 
	Dereth's most famous personalities may pay them a visit! The farmers have 
	also been gearing up for the holiday season. While getting their pumpkins 
	ready, there have been some strange reports coming out of the pumpkin 
	patches. It would be great if the people of Dereth can figure out what is 
	going on!<br>
	<br>
	The Town Criers will also be getting into the festival spirit this year. 
	They have been picking out their masks, as well as some costumes. You never 
	know what they might be dressed as when you get into town! Don't forget to 
	chat with them; they are going to have a lot to talk about this season.<br>
	<br>
	There have also been some Viamontian sightings recently. It appears they may 
	be doing some digging. What could they be looking for? What will they find? 
	And does this have anything to do with the season?</p>

    <p><span lang="en-us">Welcome to the October Letter to the Players!<br>
    <br>
    Over the last month in Dereth the Viamontian's have been on the move. Having 
    already taken over several towns on the Island of Marae Lassel, what will be 
    the next move that King Varicci II has in mind? <br>
    <br>
    <b>Changes to the Team</b><br>
    For those that missed the announcement on our forums our own Jonathan &quot;Calandryll&quot; 
    Hanna has decided to stay on as the Producer for Asheron's Call. We are all 
    happy to see that he has done this, and we are looking forward to what he 
    brings to the team. We also brought an AC1 Alumni back to the team. Speed, 
    who had been working in our QA department came back to us and jumped right 
    into the fray, creating some very cool content for this update. <br>
    <br>
    Let's get right to what is happening this month in Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    <b>New for October</b><br>
    It is the time of year again when the leaves begin to change and chill is in 
    the air. This of course means it is Festival time! As one of our favorite 
    times of year the Festival event represents a time of celebration in Dereth. 
    This year we decided to concentrate on getting some really new and exciting 
    things for the players to do and wear. And don't forget that the Scarecrows 
    will be returning to the landscape. <br>
    <br>
    The team has worked incredibly hard on getting some new masks and guises 
    together for this year, and I think everyone will really enjoy them, once 
    they have been found. <br>
    <br>
    Town criers will also be getting some love this month. In previous years 
    they would traditionally wear masks during the festival season. This year 
    they have decided to take it one step further. They will be in full costume! 
    You may notice some strange costume combinations, but that's ok, the Town 
    Criers decided to be a little different this year and mixed up things a bit. 
    Make sure you check them out. <br>
    <br>
    Everybody's favorite drunk is on the move again. Where has Ulgrim gone to 
    this time? And what does he have to say about his travels? <br>
    <br>
    There have also been some new treats and goodies added to the game. Some 
    will be found, some will be given, and yet some others will be earned. It is 
    the festival event, so what better way to celebrate than with tricks and 
    treats?<br>
    <br>
    For those of you who like to participate in our many live events we have 
    been running, there will be some special rewards given out. I won't give it 
    away here, but lets just say that you might want to make sure you have some 
    space in your packs for some new friends. <br>
    <br>
    On the subject of live events, we have gotten a lot of great feedback on 
    these events. One piece of feedback we have gotten was that these events are 
    always in a town where players might not want to participate. With that and 
    a few other reasons in mind, we have created some new dungeons which we will 
    be using for the sole purpose of running live events. We feel this will add 
    a new dynamic to these events and also give us the ability to do some more 
    interesting events. This does not mean that we will be stopping the live 
    events in the towns, but it does give us a lot more options. <br>
    <br>
    Now you know what to expect this month in Dereth. I know that in past months 
    we would add the in concept section on this part of the letter but at this 
    point things are just getting back to normal from the move from LA. The In 
    Concept section will be returning for next month. <br>
    <br>
    So that's about it for now. We have some really neat things in store for 
    you, but we aren't going to give you any more hints. You will just have to 
    log in and see for yourself!<br>
    <br>
    Dereth is full of Wonders!<br>
