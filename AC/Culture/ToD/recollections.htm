    The bugs just wouldn’t stop coming. There shouldn’t even have been that many 
	in this chamber. Something was wrong.<br>
	<br>
	Adso spun away from one Olthoi’s stabbing, spearlike claw and ducked under a 
	stream of sizzling acid from another. Patches of burned and slashed leather 
	dotted his entire body, marking near-misses and narrow hits. Ignoring the 
	acid that splashed onto his already wounded shoulder, he brought the full 
	strength of his body to bear as he stepped into a lunging attack against the 
	nearest Olthoi, the one that had just spit acid at him. He found the weak 
	point where two plates of chitinous armor met just under the creature’s 
	head. He drove the point of his dirk into the gap and punched the thick 
	blade in all the way to the hilt, then twisted his wrist and slammed his 
	free hand against the pommel of his dirk like a hammer hitting a chisel.<br>
	<br>
	With a shriek and a reverberating crack, the Olthoi’s head split open from 
	the bottom. Viscera and gore spilled onto Adso’s outstretched forearm, and 
	he pulled himself back into a defensive pose as the Olthoi fell heavily to 
	the stone floor. He narrowly escaped another stabbing attack from the other 
	Olthoi as he rolled back. He drew a throwing knife with his left hand while 
	he brandished the gore-encrusted dirk with his right. Breathing hard and 
	beginning to tire, Adso watched the Olthoi’s attack patterns as he came into 
	melee range with the beast. He hunched down in a defensive squat and parried 
	the Olthoi’s attacks low and away, forcing the creature to stoop over him, 
	waiting for the telltale mandible movements that would alert him to an 
	impending acid attack.<br>
	<br>
	When the moment came, he reacted instantly and decisively. As the Olthoi 
	drew its head back to spew acid at him, Adso’s left hand shot out and jabbed 
	the throwing knife right into the spot between the Olthoi’s mandibles. The 
	Olthoi reared up in agony, giving Adso just enough time and space to roll 
	mostly out of the way before acid started pouring messily from the ruin of 
	the Olthoi’s maw. Adso stood back, watching in disgusted fascination as the 
	Olthoi staggered back and forth, literally choking to death on its own acid. 
	A few splashes had gotten onto his armor, again, as acid sprayed 
	uncontrollably from the creature’s suddenly ruptured mandibles.<br>
	<br>
	So intent was Adso on the spectacle that he was almost surprised by the next 
	wave of Olthoi charging up the tunnel. They came surging towards him out of 
	the darkness, but stopped short of coming into melee range with him. He 
	could see others fanning out into the corridors beyond, probably to surround 
	him in the tunnels and cut off any chance of escape. He could feel the 
	ground shaking, felt dust and rock shaking loose from the tunnel’s ceiling 
	and walls as something truly huge emerged from the shadowed chamber at the 
	far end of this tunnel.<br>
	<br>
	“This can’t be right,” Adso thought as the Olthoi Queen shuffled forward 
	with all her soldier-children gathered around her. “There hasn’t been a 
	Queen in these tunnels since…” His thought went unfinished as he caught a 
	glimpse of a grisly trophy impaled on one of the Queen’s claws: a human 
	head, with long blonde hair hanging from it, now caked with blood and dirt.<br>
	<br>
	“It’s not possible,” Adso muttered to the Olthoi Queen and her assembled 
	host. “You died years ago, before I even came here…” The Queen hissed, as if 
	in response, and Adso began to back up the tunnel, retracing his steps to 
	the surface. The Olthoi horde followed him, step for step, accompanied by 
	triumphant-sounding hisses and screeches from their Queen. Finally, Adso 
	turned and ran as fast as he could, and the horde took off after him in 
	shrieking, chittering pursuit.<br>
	<br>
	Adso found his exit tunnel blocked by rapidly advancing bugs, too many to 
	avoid or quickly kill. He fled down another tunnel, in search of an 
	alternate route, only to find it similarly blocked with a mass of charging 
	insects, and so he ran again. At some point he gave up on trying to keep a 
	sense of direction in the maze-like warren of tunnels and ran down whichever 
	path seemed least dangerous or most likely to lead upward, towards fresh air 
	and freedom. He was caught several times by Olthoi ambushes. Though he 
	managed to narrowly escape a fatal strike each time and killed several more 
	Olthoi, he was stabbed and burned repeatedly, and the ordeal was taking its 
	toll on his health and his equipment. He gulped potions when he could and 
	just tried to keep one step ahead of the ravening bugs.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, after an eternity of running and fighting, with the breath wheezing 
	out of him, his muscles burning with fatigue and his potions all gone, he 
	saw a patch of light at the end of a long, upward-leading tunnel. Ignoring 
	the pain that wracked his body, Adso ran. He was almost to the edge of the 
	tunnel when a black spike lanced out of the darkness and impaled his calf. 
	He stumbled and rolled to the ground, muscles torn. Behind him he could see 
	three Olthoi and the darkened side in which they’d been hiding. He’d failed 
	to notice that deeper patch of blackness on his way to the exit, blinded by 
	fatigue and desperate hope of an escape. He’d fallen right into their trap.<br>
	<br>
	“How’d you outsmart me anyway?” he asked softly, as the Olthoi crept slowly 
	up on him. As if in answer to his question, there was a glow of purple light 
	from behind. Adso turned his head to look, and he saw that a Virindi had 
	appeared in the tunnel up ahead, in the exit to the surface world that had 
	attracted his attention. He tried to crawl that way with just his arms and 
	one good leg, determined at least to die in the fresh air, and not in these 
	dank tunnels.<br>
	<br>
	It wasn’t just any Virindi, though… As Adso crawled closer, he could make 
	out its masked face. Not the kind of mask that he was used to seeing on 
	Virindi, and something in its posture indicated curiosity or interest, more 
	than was usual from these aloof beings. The Virindi floated closer, and he 
	could hear a voice, impatient and eager, echoing in his mind. “Tell me, 
	human… How true does this realm feel to you? Did we correctly map the 
	details? Master will be displeased if our work is imperfect…”<br>
	<br>
	Before Adso could shake off his confusion and try to respond, there was an 
	explosion of pain from his midsection. He looked behind him and saw that 
	he’d been impaled to the ground by an Olthoi claw through his abdomen. He 
	could feel the blood pooling hot beneath him, felt the agony from his 
	stomach… Above him loomed an Olthoi, its other claw already slick with blood 
	from Adso’s leg. The bloody claw reared up in the air, ready to end his 
	life… then lanced downward, right at his head…<br>
	<br>
	* * * * * * * *<br>
	<br>
	Adso woke up with a shout. It took him a moment to realize that he was lying 
	in a bedroll by a campfire, not on a blood-slicked patch of tunnel with 
	Olthoi and a strangely curious Virindi around him. He looked around, scared 
	and confused, and saw Master and Sabithra also sitting up in their bedrolls, 
	both of them wide-eyed and disoriented.<br>
	<br>
	“I dreamed that the Olthoi Queen was not dead,” Adso gasped.<br>
	<br>
	“I dreamed that the Hopeslayer ruled Dereth! The seas and rivers were red 
	with blood…” Sabithra whispered.<br>
	<br>
	The two of them looked at each other, then looked at their Master, who was 
	still silent, staring into the distance.<br>
	<br>
	“Master?” Adso whispered. “Master, did you dream of something?”<br>
	<br>
	“I dreamed I was still on Ispar,” their Master muttered, his voice hollow 
	with terror.<br>

	<p>Ardry tightened the straps on his pack and slung it over his shoulder. 
	The pack was bulging with books, not the field rations and spare weaponry 
	that was his usual load-out when departing the chapterhouse. The small 
	library here was his second-to-last stop on a long book-gathering 
	expedition. Of course, this was not a normal mission, and he was relieved to 
	have been assigned, for once, to a fairly safe task when the majority of his 
	fellow scouts had been dispatched to some of the most dangerous corners of 
	the realm.<br>
	<br>
	Walking through the deserted hallways of the chapterhouse, Ardry nodded to 
	the chamberlain Eddred at his desk as he walked to the exit portal. The old 
	veteran nodded back, more interested in his whittling than the departure of 
	the last scout. With most of the membership out on missions, Eddred wouldn’t 
	be needed until the wounded started trickling in, probably some hours from 
	now…<br>
	<br>
	Ardry stepped through the portal and into the bright, chilly morning light 
	of the coast near Ayan Baqur. He trekked up the hill towards the Smoking Axe 
	tavern in town. When he got there, his cousin Ulgrim was hunched over next 
	to the entrance of the tavern, snoring softly, with an empty mug in his 
	hand. Ardry almost stooped to take the empty mug from Ulgrim’s hand to bring 
	it in to the tavern keeper, but he remembered the terrible rain of boulders 
	that his cousin had reflexively conjured from the sky the last time someone 
	tried to pull a mug out of his hand while asleep… <br>
	<br>
	Thinking better of it, Ardry went into the tavern and ordered two pints of 
	stout from Berkholt. He sat cross-legged near his cousin and set the mugs on 
	the ground.<br>
	<br>
	“Cousin,” he said softly. There was no response. “Cousin!” Still no 
	interruption of the snoring. He tried shaking Ulgrim’s shoulder, and still 
	the old man slept on. <br>
	<br>
	Sighing, Ardry said, “Free beer!” and was almost knocked over when Ulgrim 
	shouted and jumped to his feet. It took a few moments for the besotted 
	scholar to gain his bearings, and to spot Ardry sitting on the ground with 
	two frosty mugs of stout beside him.<br>
	<br>
	“Ah, young Ardry, how are you? And you brought stout, wonderful, dear boy. I 
	must remember to tell your mother what a considerate child she raised. How 
	is she, anyway?”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry grimaced. “Still on Ispar, as she’s been all these years, Cousin 
	Ulgrim.” He offered up a mug of stout. “Take the edge off?”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim eagerly grabbed the mug and drained half of it in one gulp. “Ahhh, 
	that hits the spot. Several of them, as it turns out.” He smacked his lips 
	with satisfaction, took a more leisurely sip, and regarded his cousin with 
	surprisingly wary eyes. “So what can I do for you, Ardry?”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry decided to come right out with it. “Uncle Aliester would like your 
	notes on the Virindi Quiddity.”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim’s eyes flashed. “Why would my cousin need that?” he asked. “Could it 
	be, because my predictions are coming true?”<br>
	<br>
	“Which predictions were those, exactly?” Ardry asked. His cousin was 
	notorious for making a thousand self-contradictory claims about the threat 
	posed by the Virindi.<br>
	<br>
	“The predictions about the Virindi turning our brains to applesauce! I’ve 
	been talking about this since Jaleh founded this town and asked me to come 
	along and serve as the distinguished local scholar and man about town!”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded sagely, humoring Ulgrim’s claim, knowing that his cousin had 
	actually passed out drunk in the back of Berkholt’s wagon before the 
	expedition set out, and had not been discovered until they were halfway 
	across the desert. “Of course. The applesauce predictions. Well, you were 
	certainly right about that town takeover a few years ago…”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim nodded, mollified. “I’m glad you understand, Ardry. No one else in 
	this bloody town does.” He drained the rest of his mug, and wordlessly 
	accepted the second mug. “Well, since your mother was always so nice to me, 
	I’ll give you what you’re looking for. Even if it’s just because pompous old 
	Aliester asked. Did you know, I was granted tenure at university before he 
	was, even though he’d started his dissertation a year before me?” Ardry 
	nodded, familiar with the tales. He continued to nod and make sympathetic 
	noises as Ulgrim ranted, all the while patting at various regions of his 
	ratty robes, evidently searching for something…<br>
	<br>
	“Aha!” Ulgrim cried in triumph, pulling a rolled-up sheaf of papers from his 
	boot. The sheets were tattered, stained, with uneven edges. It even looked 
	like some tavern dishrags were in there, covered with scribbles. And it 
	smelled like… nothing Ardry had ever smelled before, even when he’d been 
	face-down in the bottom of a Mosswart warren. He tucked the pile of papers 
	into his pack, hoping that nothing would leak out of it to damage any of the 
	more fragile books in there.<br>
	<br>
	“My collected observations on the nature of the Virindi Quiddity, with 
	particular attention paid to the concept of a collective unconscious,” 
	Ulgrim announced proudly. He looked around conspiratorially, then leaned 
	close to inform Ardry, “I keep it in my boot because it’s the one place the 
	Virindi wouldn’t look. They don’t have feet, you see?”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry accepted the papers and smiled indulgently. “Of course. Makes perfect 
	sense.” He got to his feet. “I’m sorry to have to run, cousin, but I really 
	must get back to Uncle Aliester.”<br>
	<br>
	“Make sure that old windbag credits me on whatever he publishes! Academic 
	fraud is a serious offense!” Ulgrim yelled at him as he departed.<br>
	<br>
	* * * * * * * *<br>
	<br>
	Ardry stepped into the clearing near the cottage that Aliester the 
	Loquacious maintained as his residence and research center. He saw bright 
	candle light coming from the workshop where Aliester did all his alchemical 
	experimentation.<br>
	<br>
	As he approached, there was a flash of light and a loud bang from the 
	workshop. A concussive blast of air washed over him and knocked him off his 
	feet. He rolled upright quickly and ran for the cottage, fearing for his 
	uncle’s life.<br>
	<br>
	Uncle Aliester met him in the front room as he came running through the open 
	door. The old man was covered with black soot, and fragments of metal and 
	glass were all over his robes, but he had a cheerful, almost joyous 
	expression on his face.<br>
	<br>
	“Ardry, my boy! I’ve finally isolated the variable that was destabilizing 
	the concentration of those new alchemical infusions!”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry blinked. “I’m not sure I understood any of that, Uncle,” he said.<br>
	<br>
	Aliester waved his hand dismissively. “Never mind, you never were much 
	interested in the alchemical experiments. Are you still angry over the 
	Reedshark chum incident? Never mind that, have you got the books?”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry brought his pack to a nearby table. He opened it and began to stack 
	the books on the table. “Everything you asked for, and a couple more that I 
	came across, that looked interesting.”<br>
	<br>
	“Oh?” Aliester looked intrigued. “What were the extra books?”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry produced two slim volumes from his pack, which looked like personal 
	journals rather than guild-produced books. “Queen Elysa’s personal 
	recollections of the slaying of the Olthoi Queen, which Prince Borelean 
	insisted I take while I was in the royal archives. And this is a journal of 
	the confrontation with the Hopeslayer, written some years ago by an 
	adventurer who led an expedition into the Sepulcher, who only identified 
	himself as Animal of Frostfell.”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester smiled through soot-blackened lips. “Well done, Ardry! Both useful 
	to our purposes, I am sure. In fact…” He examined the second book for a 
	moment, then handed it back to Ardry. “You should read this one yourself. 
	Memorize it. Become familiar with every detail in it. That’s very important 
	to your next mission, Ardry. You must have a foolproof memory!”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry stared at the book, then at his Uncle. His heart sank as he realized 
	what the nature of his next assignment would be.</p>

	<p>Hello and welcome to the Release Notes for the January 2008 update of 
	Asheron’s Call! This month we find that the seasons have once again changed, 
	and a chill is in the air. With this change of seasons, we see the arrival 
	of snow once again across the landscape. This of course means that players 
	may run into a snowman or two in their adventures. Be careful though, as not 
	all snowmen are friendly. <br>
	<br>
	Some adventurers have been reporting that they have been having some 
	problems recalling exactly what happened during some of Dereth’s major 
	events. Some feel that Aerbax is involved in this somehow. Perhaps speaking 
	with Asheron could clear things up? <br>
	<br>
	Lets see what else is happening in Dereth this month! <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	We have raised the damage of Streak spells across the board. Players using 
	these spells should notice an increased amount of damage when using these 
	spells in combat. Below is a listing of the damage before and after the 
	changes we have made. <br>
	<br>
	Streak Damage Before January Update<br>
	<br>
	Level 1: 15-30<br>
	Level 2: 16-32<br>

		use grenades create their wares in batches now. We suggest all those 
		interested, speak with Janier al-Evv in Xarabydun. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>With the turning of the seasons, the landscape has once again begun 
		to take on a more winter feel.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The events that were started in October, will be turned off this 
		month. This includes the Al-Jalima invasion, the Harvest Reaper spawns, 
		and the the Majestic Pumpkin. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Frosthaven has once again become an active area. Make sure to check 
		the area out and help the snowmen. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Rumors of a Snowman who is need of assistance have been floating 
		around recently. They say he has been seen most frequently in the 
		mountains to the northeast. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Since it is the winter season, the presents have returned to Dereth. 
		Have you been good?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Some new named creatures have been seen in the Direlands. It is 
		reported that these creatures are not only a bit tougher, but they also 
		drop a unique item upon death, which can be turned in for a reward. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Aerbax is up to something strange. Many of Dereth’s citizens have 
		been reporting having some strange visions of events past. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A new face has appeared in Fort Tethana. Make sure you investigate 
		why he is here. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Players will soon have the ability to purchase a rename for their 
		characters. There are some rules and restrictions to this new feature. 
		Please keep watching the forums for the official announcement.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call 
	in January. Please remember that along with everything listed here, there 
	are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	January event.</font></td>
