	<p>
    King Varicci II strode down the hallway, followed by a retinue of robed 
	councilors and huge, armored bodyguards. The clank of their footfalls on the 
	bare stone floor was the only sound in the long, dark stretch of corridor. 
	This remote section of the tunnel complex beneath Sanamar had been given 
	over to a legion of mages and scholars, all laboring to fulfill the King's 
	very ambitious demands.<br>
	<br>
	The King stopped in front of a huge door, constructed of thick slabs of oak, 
	bound with bands of steel and pyreal, and carved all over with protective 
	symbols. Varicci raised his hand, as if to shove the door open, then paused 
	as if remembering something. He grabbed the stout bronze knocker and, very 
	slowly and deliberately, knocked three times. The sounds boomed and echoed 
	down the long corridor.<br>
	<br>
	After a few seconds, the door creaked inward and a bent, sallow man in 
	ragged robes stood before them. &quot;Master Darigo,&quot; said the King. &quot;We have 
	come to examine the fruits of your labor.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Please enter and be welcome, Your Majesty.&quot; Darigo bowed deeply and turned 
	to allow the King's group to come inside. <br>
	<br>
	Beyond the door was a large, circular room. The fringes of the room were 
	filled with arcane magical devices and paraphernalia, the tools of the dozen 
	mages who worked daily on one of the King's most important projects. In the 
	center of the room was a stone pedestal, engraved with ancient, alien 
	symbols of blood magic. A malevolent indigo glow emanated from something 
	long and thin on top of the pedestal.<br>
	<br>
	Varicci sniffed the air. &quot;It smells like a storm just hit in here.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;We completed the final enchantment not five minutes ago, great King. His 
	Majesty has exquisite timing.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci snorted. &quot;If I had impeccable timing, we wouldn't be trapped on this 
	benighted world, battling emboldened Bloodless led by an upjumped peasant.&quot; 
	Ignoring the other mages in the room, he grabbed Darigo by the arm and 
	marched towards the pedestal. Forced along by the King's heavy hand, Darigo 
	shuffled as quickly as he could to keep up with the King's steps. A few of 
	the King's more courageous or curious councilors followed. The rest stood 
	well back, fear in their eyes as they beheld the darkly glowing pedestal.<br>
	<br>
	Upon closer inspection, the object atop the pedestal was wreathed in 
	swirling tendrils of dark energy. &quot;Is it safe to touch?&quot; Varicci asked. When 
	Darigo nodded, he reached out and gingerly grasped the thing, held it up to 
	the light. &quot;And this thing... will work? You are sure?&quot; He locked eyes with 
	the master mage, watching his eyes for any hint of uncertainty.<br>
	<br>
	Darigo nodded emphatically. &quot;The enchantment has been properly applied and 
	bound. Count Dardante's expertise, especially his modifications to the 
	design of our binding circle, proved to be crucial. But as we expected, our 
	abilities are limited by our incomplete knowledge. The enchantment is so 
	strong and so terrible that the binding will only survive one use.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Varicci nodded. &quot;One use will serve. For now.&quot; He held the object up high in 
	front of his face, turning it in his hand. The light coming off it washed 
	against the walls of the chamber, covering everything with an unsettling 
	purple glow. Varicci smiled. It was a savage and wolfish smile, one that 
	promised pain for someone or something else. &quot;I will name you... 
	Heartbreaker.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He placed the object very carefully back in its place on the pedestal. 
	&quot;Excellent work, Master Darigo. You and your colleagues will be well 
	rewarded. But this is no excuse to slow your efforts. This is but the first 
	step. I expect that the translators will have more research texts for you by 
	week's end. Not to mention the artifact that Master Malsivir has located. We 
	expect great advances, once he has brought it to you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	With that, Varicci turned and strode briskly out of the room. His retinue 
	fell into formation behind their monarch as the mages all bowed to the 
	King's retreating back.<br>
	<br>
	Varicci led the group towards the farthest end of the hall, towards a 
	staircase flanked by a pair of monstrous Knights. The stairs led down into a 
	dank warren of tunnels and cells, the Chambers of Vivimancy. Here was where 
	traitors and particularly dangerous criminals were given over to the King's 
	mages, to serve as experimental fodder. Many of the Knights currently 
	serving in the King's legions had ended their previous lives in these very 
	chambers.<br>
	<br>
	The King led his party to the far end of the longest tunnel, to a door made 
	entirely of steel. A small sliding panel was built into the door's frame at 
	head height, to allow the gaolers to look into the cell at the prisoner 
	within. Varicci slid aside the panel. A pair of dully glowing red eyes 
	looked back at him.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Hello, Commander,&quot; Varicci murmured in a soft voice. &quot;We've made you your 
	toy. We're almost ready for your big moment.&quot;</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Two old men sat at a table in the Sanamar tavern, 
	fussing at their meals and nursing mugs of ale. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;I've heard some awful things from the herald this morning, and this ale's 
	not strong enough to take the edge off,&quot; said one, as he probed his spoon 
	through his bowl of stew, looking for more hunks of beef.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What's there to worry about now, Bruno?&quot; the other one sighed. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh, don't roll your eyes at me, Merro,&quot; growled Bruno. &quot;Remember, I was 
	right about the portals, wasn't I?&quot; <br>
	<br>
	These two had been having the same conversation about the troubles of the 
	realm of Viamont for over twenty years, on both Auberean and Ispar. The 
	incidents for concern were always different, but the tenor of the 
	conversation remained the same: Bruno complaining about the instability of 
	their King, whether it was about Varicci I in the Bull's Head Tavern in 
	Corcosa or about Varicci II here in the capital-in-exile of Sanamar. The 
	fact that Bruno had been right about the inadvisability of entering that 
	portal back on Ispar gave him enough satisfaction to keep complaining for 
	another twenty years.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes, you were right about the portals,&quot; Merro admitted for the thousandth 
	time. He took a long quaff of ale and stole a glance across the bar at the 
	tradesman Rand, wondering if the good brewmaster could brew a beer strong 
	enough to blunt his friend's complaints. &quot;So what was the news you heard 
	this morning?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I hear tell the Boy King has sent some of his most valuable soldiers and 
	scholars into some old Empyrean vault –&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;But he's been doing that since we got to this blighted land!&quot; Merro 
	protested.<br>
	<br>
	Bruno sniffed. &quot;Can I finish my story?&quot; Without waiting for a further word 
	from Merro, he pressed on. &quot;This one is different. You know how some of them 
	Aluvians who came through here talked about Asheron?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I remember the story. This is the old Empyrean who was responsible for 
	those portals showing up on Ispar?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The very same. Well, suffice it to say that instead of opening dusty tombs 
	and stealing headstones to furnish his castle, the Boy King is poking around 
	in this Asheron's personal business! Not wise to anger a big muckety-muck 
	sorcerer, especially when he's committed so many troops to Glenden Wood, and 
	a hundred other follies&amp; Plus, I've heard that this sorcerer is the Aluvian 
	queen's lover!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I really wish you'd stop calling him the Boy King,&quot; Merro said. &quot;He's our 
	King, and even a gormless old fool like you needs to watch how you speak of 
	him.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Bruno drained his mug. &quot;Bah. He's got bigger fish to fry than me. And I will 
	continue to call him the Boy King. He&amp; His father&amp; He's just not&amp; Not&amp;&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Not as old as his father? Sons rarely are,&quot; Merro quipped. &quot;Maybe you ought 
	to forgive him for waiting until he was a greybeard to call himself King.&quot; 
	He finished off his own mug.<br>
	<br>
	Bruno's reply was drowned out by an explosion outside the tavern. The old 
	man jumped in his seat and, with agility that was remarkable for one of his 
	age, dove under the table.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I knew it, I knew it! The Royal Thaumaturges are coming for me, aren't 
	they?&quot; he wailed.<br>
	<br>
	A dense cloud of smoke wafted into the tavern from outside. Striding through 
	the noxious fumes came a Viamontian noble in stained and torn clothes. He 
	carried a barrel on his shoulder.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Duke Raoul,&quot; muttered Merro, groaning. The Black Fist of Viamont, Duke 
	Raoul Lascera, was well known for causing scandals and uproar wherever he 
	went. It was said that his traveling companion, Apothecary Zongo, was a 
	witch doctor of Souia-Vey who dabbled in poisons and dangerous 
	distillations.<br>
	<br>
	Zongo was nowhere in evidence today, which Merro counted as good fortune. 
	Raoul was scanning the room through bloodshot eyes, when he saw Rand.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Rand! There you are! Ye gods, I've found it!&quot; Raoul's voice was a guttural, 
	staccato bark. It was a voice that compelled men to obey – if they could 
	understand what he was saying. With that, he stepped toward a table and 
	slung the barrel off his shoulder.<br>
	<br>
	Merro took a good look at the barrel. The tap on top identified it as a keg. 
	The black fist emblazoned on the side indicated that it had been brewed by 
	Duke Raoul. Merro and Bruno looked at each other, and came to the same 
	decision.<br>
	<br>
	Both of the old men stood – Merro from his seat, and Bruno crawling out from 
	under the table.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I say there, m'lord&amp;&quot; Bruno said. &quot;What's that you've got there, and can my 
	friend and I trouble you for a taste?&quot;</span></p>

	November 11, 2005</font></span></p>
	<p>Welcome to the November Letter to the Players.<br>
	<br>
	During the last month, we had a bit of a break from the continuing assault 
	of King Varicci's troops. We were able to celebrate the Festival season in 
	grand style, and even had a few surprises along the way. Now that the 
	festival season is over, what will happen next?<br>
	<br>
	New for November<br>
	Our friend Ulgrim is on the move again. Did he leave for a reason, or is he 
	just a bit more active now that the season has changed? If you ask me, I 
	think he was smart to leave Glenden Wood when he did. Bad things may be 
	happening there. It may be wise not to log out in that town this month.<br>
	<br>
	There have been some mysterious rumblings in the Meeting halls. It may be 
	wise to move your mules out of these halls for this month.<br>
	<br>
	Town criers have removed their costumes this month, and let me tell you, 
	they are thankful for that. Some of those costumes can get pretty hot when 
	you are standing in the sun all day.<br>
	<br>
	We have revised some more dungeons this month. Don't forget to check out 
	some of your old favorites for some new twists. The Viamontians have been 
	very curious about what can be found in some of these dungeons.<br>
	<br>
	The Pumpkin Buffer will no longer be in Glenden Wood this month. Make sure 
	to pay it a visit before the November event begins.<br>
	<br>
	Masks and Guises will be available for another month. So for anyone who 
	hasn't had a chance to get some of the new items that came in this year, you 
	will still be able to do so.<br>
	<br>
	The Pack Remoran has been fixed this month. When they showed up last month 
	they would hook backwards when placed on housing hooks. You will be seeing 
	these elusive pack dolls more in upcoming events.<br>
	<br>
	Viamontian Town Criers are no longer doing the drudge dance. They have 
	decided that it is beneath them.<br>
	<br>
	<b>In-Concept<br>
	</b>These are some of the game changes that we are thinking about for 
	February and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or even if – any of these 
	changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and priorities can change. 
	These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that 
	we'll be introducing in each monthly event. Your feedback on these topics is 
	particularly valuable.<br>
	<br>
	- Additional Allegiance Management Improvements<br>
	<br>
	- Additional High-Level Hunting Areas<br>
	<br>
	- Player-vs-Player Improvements<br>
	<br>
	- Friends Panel<br>
	<br>
	The items that are included in this section are just some of the things we 
	are looking at for future changes. As time goes on this list will continue 
	to change and expand. As always, all in-concept ideas are subject to change 
	with scheduling and priority changes. <span lang="en-us">
