    Asheron sat at his great white desk, staring into the flames of his candles. 
	The desk was ancient, a relic of the Realaidain family. The white stone 
	surface of the table had been well polished by use, its corners worn smooth 
	from age, even when his father Lord Atlan had planned that fateful 
	expedition to Daralet over 2500 years ago. Instead of his father’s maps and 
	military dispatches, the table now bore a pile of reports from Queen Elysa 
	and the great leather-bound book in which he kept his personal 
	recollections. He was recording all he could remember of his ordeal on Bur, 
	from the first reports of trouble that had inspired his journey, to the 
	torture he had endured at the hands of the Falatacot and the disruption of 
	the Matriarchs’ ritual. He had spent some time recuperating and recovering 
	himself. After that he had re-established contact with Queen Elysa and his 
	other friends in Dereth, and completed some obvious much-needed improvements 
	to the security of his sanctuary. Only then had he devoted his attention to 
	the recording of what he had been through, and to learning of what had 
	happened in Dereth during his absence.<br>
	<br>
	As he finished his last notes on the Bur ordeal, he set down his pen and 
	rubbed his hands together. He could still feel phantom sensations all over – 
	his body’s recollection of the tortures and bloodletting inflicted upon him 
	by the Falatacot. He shuddered to think of what they could have done, had 
	they actually made use of his heart’s blood for their ritual... Luckily, 
	intrepid adventurers from Dereth, aided by certain of his friends, had 
	decoded the clues he left behind, found their way to Bur, and prevented the 
	Matriarchs from sacrificing him to their cruel gods. It was another debt he 
	felt he owed to Queen Elysa and her resourceful subjects.<br>
	<br>
	Putting the thoughts of Bur behind him, he glanced at the pile of reports 
	next to his journal. He’d read through most of them already, but he was 
	reviewing them again to be sure of his understanding. Much had occurred 
	during his captivity, including the rise and fall of an ancient Kemeroi-spawned 
	terror from the dawn of days, a strange demon with three bodies named Grael 
	that had once stalked the same paths of madness and vengeance as the 
	Hopeslayer...<br>
	<br>
	He had been away from Dereth while the Viamontian King Varicci, whose people 
	and lands had been concealed from him in ways he still did not understand, 
	had launched a war on Elysa’s realm and slain Elysa’s noble consort Antius. 
	The very fact that Antius had been slain and severed from his lifestone was 
	something that concerned him greatly, but the King’s efforts to reproduce 
	this terrible “Heartbreaker” sword had been halted by Elysa’s agents, the 
	Whispering Blade. The young Prince Borelean had grown older, stronger, and 
	curiously colder during his time away. Brooding over all this, he picked up 
	the pile of reports dealing with the defeat of Grael and resolved himself to 
	finish re-reading them before he’d allow himself a pause to rest.<br>
	<br>
	When he finally finished his reading, the candles had burned down to stubs 
	and their light flickered. He felt restless and his vision was swimming. He 
	had been down here in the dark of his study for too long. He sighed to 
	himself, flexed his fingers, and opened a pathway to the balcony of his 
	castle. He stepped onto the warm sunlit stones and looked out over his 
	island. The grounds were clear of the humans that had flocked to the 
	sanctuary in the days after his return. He spoke softly to one of his golem 
	attendants, which rumbled to life and trudged dutifully into the castle to 
	carry out his commands.<br>
	<br>
	While he awaited the golem’s return, he tried to relax, leaning against the 
	balcony’s wall, basking in sunlight and breathing deeply of the fresh sea 
	air. With his keen eyes, he could see the shore of Dereth’s mainland. Even 
	now, to judge from the latest news, there were ominous tidings from the 
	realm across the water. There were reports of a strange band of human 
	assassins freshly arrived from Ispar. An ancient graveyard had arisen in the 
	Direlands that bore the mark of the Dericostian Lord Rytheran’s twisted 
	power. People had been disappearing around the realm, apparent victims of 
	kidnapping. Unrest had been reported among the Mosswarts and Banderlings. 
	The human town of Cragstone, dear to Queen Elysa’s heart, was under siege by 
	the suddenly ambitious Drudges, who had previously been content to skulk in 
	the shadows and steal food and wine and anything shiny that had been left 
	unguarded. Were any of these events connected? He could not say for sure.<br>
	<br>
	In time, the golem returned with a chair and a flagon of chilled wine. It 
	also carried a fresh pile of reports from Queen Elysa’s agents, and a letter 
	from one of his contacts in Ayan Baqur. He reclined on the chair, in the 
	shade cast by his looming golem attendant, sipping cool wine and listening 
	to the crash of waves as he read the latest dispatches. The more he read, 
	the more he became convinced that there was a common thread running through 
	these incidents with the Drudges, Mosswarts, and Banderlings. Someone or 
	something was interfering with those three humanoid races.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, when he read the letter from his agent in Ayan Baqur, he was 
	convinced. He turned to the golem that stood at attention by his side. 
	Sensing his attention, the automaton turned to face him.<br>
	<br>
	Asheron looked up at the golem and said, “What is that crafty devil up to? 
	Am I going to have to get involved, before his experiments threaten the 
	realm again? It seems he is not content with being such a singular 
	creature...” The golem didn’t respond to his idle question. Its eyes 
	remained blank and passive, awaiting an order from its master.<br>
	<br>
	Asheron sighed and sipped more wine. He looked away from the golem, out over 
	the narrow stretch of sea that separated his island from Dereth, then 
	glanced at the spidery writing on the paper in his hand. “Applesauce,” he 
	muttered, and then he snorted in amusement. “The old crank may be right.”</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Ulgrim sat in the shade of the Smoking Axe Tavern of 
	Ayan Baqur. He had a rapidly warming mug of stout by his side and a letter 
	propped onto a writing tablet on his knees. It was unlike Ulgrim to leave a 
	mug of stout untouched and at the mercy of the daytime heat of Ayan Baqur, 
	but it was obvious that he was very intent on the letter he was writing.<br>
	<br>
	He stopped to think about something, and drained the mug while he thought. 
	Apparently inspired, he concluded his thoughts and signed the letter with a 
	flourish.<br>
	<br>
	... so in closing, I have considered your petition, my children, and I am 
	prepared to consider the Sho beverage sake as a suitable replacement for 
	beer if your local supplies have run out and you lack the holy water 
	necessary for your observance of the high holy rituals of the Morning Chug 
	and the Evening Pint. I add as a condition that if you wish to use sake in 
	place of proper holy water, you must keep the sake cool, as warm sake or 
	warm booze of any kind is an abomination in mine eyes. I am pleased with 
	your deference in this matter and I will make all necessary arrangements to 
	ensure you suffer no shortage of beer in the future.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<i>Your beloved patron, <br>
	<br>
	Angry Grandfather<br>
	<br>
	</i><br>
	<br>
	His latest missive finished, he rolled it, sealed it, and stepped into the 
	Smoking Axe Tavern with his sealed letter and the empty mug.<br>
	<br>
	“Berkholt, you old rascal,” he called to the bartender as he entered, “when 
	do you suppose we’ll have more scouts wandering through here on their way to 
	those northeastern islands? I have a letter that needs to be delivered to 
	Vissidal, along with a couple of casks of your finest stout.”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt shook his head. “Maybe not for a few days, Ulgrim. There’s been 
	much unrest on the Vesayens and around Cragstone, not to mention our own 
	local Banderling problems... Folks are busy. Not everyone’s headed to 
	Vissidal these days, and those that would be heading there might not have 
	the room for your casks.”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim waved his hand in irritation. “None of these problems are the true 
	problem,” he muttered. “These are all just test runs, best ignored. This is 
	dross, not the true steel. Where’s Ardry anyway? He would have made this 
	delivery for me without too much of a fuss.”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt shrugged. “I haven’t seen your nephew or cousin or however he’s 
	related to you… Not in at least a week. What’s that you’re saying about true 
	problems? People shouldn’t be worried about the siege of Cragstone?”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim snorted as he sidled up to the bar. “Siege! Pour me a stout and I’ll 
	tell you about that siege!”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt obliged and tapped another pint for the old man. “All right, Ulgrim, 
	tell me about the siege.”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim downed half the pint in one gulp. “So the Drudges are besieging 
	Cragstone. Are we really spending our time worrying about Drudges, just 
	because the little squeakers have figured out how to run in the same 
	direction?” He downed the other half of the stout in one gulp and shoved the 
	empty mug back at Berkholt with an imperious gesture.<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt, used to Ulgrim’s wild stories and endless thirst, sighed and 
	poured another mug. He’d found that pouring the mug was cheaper than having 
	Ulgrim sit outside and whisper threatening nonsense at his paying customers.<br>
	<br>
	The old man’s eyes lit up when he was given the second pint. He lifted the 
	mug high, as if he intended to drain it again, but then seemed to change his 
	mind. He took a modest sip, and continued his lecture. “No, to spend so much 
	time mucking with the Drudges in Cragstone, or the Mosswarts on the Vesayens, 
	or the Banderlings around here is to distract ourselves from the true 
	threat!”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt nodded with the patience of a man who’s heard it all before. “So 
	what’s the true threat?”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim sipped some more stout, then looked around warily, checking to see 
	that no unfriendlies would be around to hear his next words. He leaned in 
	closer to Berkholt. “Virindi, of course. The true threat has always been the 
	Virindi.”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt shook his head. “The Virindi were defeated years ago, Ulgrim. So 
	you were right about their plans to take over the town. I gave you credit 
	for that. Everyone acknowledged you were right about that – even though 
	Claude and Leopold weren’t involved in that attack. But this sounds like 
	just another incident in your strange fixation on Claude and Leopold.”<br>
	<br>
	“Claude’s gone, barman!” Ulgrim spewed beer all over the counter in his 
	vehemence to make his point. “He’s been gone a whole month! There’s 
	something afoot with those two! And Leopold... He smiles at me when he sees 
	me walk past that tent now! He smiles at me, like he knows he’ll be wearing 
	my hide as a cloak not too long from now!”<br>
	<br>
	Berkholt laughed. “Leopold smiles at you as you walk past? Have you any idea 
	how insane that sounds? Leopold’s mask doesn’t even have a mouth on it! As 
	for Claude, I’m not one to take the disappearance of a Virindi as a 
	world-threatening event. This sounds just like the time you warned us about 
	how Claude was actually Grael in disguise, or that Leopold was the one that 
	kidnapped Asheron on Bur...”<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim threw up his hands in disgust. “There’s no reasoning with you. Just 
	remember this when your brain gets turned to applesauce again! That is, if 
	it ever got un-sauced from the first time!” He stormed out of the tavern, 
	muttering angrily to himself. A moment later he came back inside, picked up 
	the half-empty mug of stout, and drained it quickly. As he slammed the empty 
	mug down on the bar, he fixed Berkholt with his crazy eyes. He let out a 
	loud burp, then leaned in close to Berkholt and said, “Applesauce, I tell 
	you! Applesauce!”<br>
	With that, he stormed out of the tavern once more, and Berkholt could only 
	shake his head as he watched the temperamental old man go.</span></p>

	<p>Hello there and welcome to the May event: Prodigal Sons! This month the 
	strange behavior from some of Dereth’s better know creatures continues. What 
	or who is behind these recent occurrences of strange behavior and why now? 
	Will things continue on, and what will happen next? <br>
	<br>
	Let’s see what else is happening in the world of Asheron’s Call this month!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ongoing issues with server performance are still being 
		investigated by the team. The cause of the issue is proving very 
		difficult to track down. We have added extra monitoring and data 
		gathering tools on to the servers in order to help us get these issues 
		resolved. Based on some recent data we have already been able to reduce 
		the amount of these issues by quite a bit, and we will be continuing to 
		work on getting things back to normal as quickly as we can. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Some new weapons have been created for live event rewards. These 
		weapons have a higher than normal damage, but they only last for a 
		limited amount of time. If you are lucky enough to receive one of the 
		new weapons, please make sure that you use it only when you are ready. 
		Players who receive these weapons will get them in the form of a 1 time 
		only use gem which once used will produce the weapon. Once the weapon 
		has been created the player will have 3 hours to use their new weapon 
		before it is destroyed. Please keep in mind that the timer for these 
		weapons will continue to count down even if the player wielding it logs 
		out of the game. Here are a couple of examples of these new weapons. 
		</li>

    <ul>
		<li>Several of Dereth’s better know creatures have been acting a bit odd 
		lately. Drudges, Banderling’s and Mosswarts alike have all been a little 
		more “active” in recent days. It may be a good idea to do some more 
		investigation of this recent activity. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Drudge raids on Cragstone have lessened for some reason. They no 
		longer attack the windmill, but they still persist on looting the town 
		every so often. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>It appears that Asheron has completed building his Guardian Golem 
		with the help of Dereth’s people. He has returned to his sanctuary and 
		is no longer in the courtyard overseeing the building of the Golem. 
		Players will still be able to turn in the requested items in order to 
		help keep the Golem repaired. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The vendor that players use their collected ancient coins on now 
		sells Darts and Bolts in addition to the special arrows. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The number of arrows/bolts/darts that players get from the collected 
		Ancient coins has been increased to 2500. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The Drudge boards with nail are no longer attuned to players. They 
		will however remain destroy on death. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Hea Tuperea spawns 4 Reedsharks while he fights. When he is killed 
		the Reedsharks should remain and continue to fight. We found that he was 
		actually “killing” them when he got killed. This was not the intended 
		behavior and has been fixed for May. The Reedsharks will now continue to 
		fight after their master’s death.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Game Discussion<br>
	</b><br>
	At this time we would like to take the opportunity to discuss a feature 
	upcoming to Asheron’s Call. In the coming months we will be introducing 
	Alchemy Debuff Grenades. If you are one of our players that have Alchemy 
	trained, you will at some point be able to create and use these new grenades 
	instead of or in place of using life magic to debuff creatures or players, 
	in the case of PvP. By using a combination of some already existing and some 
	new ingredients, players with Alchemy trained will be able to create these 
	new grenades. Based on the players skill level, they will be able create 
	more powerful forms of these grenades. In addition the completed Phials will 
	add and additional bonus to the person wielding them. As we get closer to 
	these new “grenades “ going live, we will release some more details on how 
	they will work and what players will need to do to acquire them. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	May and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	May event.<br>
