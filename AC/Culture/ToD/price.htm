	<p>
    Maegris sat at his desk, scribbling notes and observations in a giant book. 
	All around him, his study was in disarray. Open books and sheaves of paper 
	were strewn over every flat surface, and the mage's fingers were stained 
	with ink. His forehead, too, was smudged with ink, from his habit of 
	kneading his temples when frustrated. Sighing, he reached for his tankard 
	and took a long swallow, grimacing at the bitterness of the brew. He 
	blinked, trying to clear his head. Arcane runes and diagrams swam before his 
	eyes. He knew he was on the verge of exhaustion, but there was little time 
	left, and he had much to do still...<br>
	<br>
	There was a knock at the heavy oaken door of his study. He looked up and 
	called, &quot;Enter.&quot; A soldier dressed in black and gold armor slowly pushed 
	open the door and stepped inside. The soldier went down to one knee and 
	awaited Maegris' word.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Speak,&quot; Maegris said, his tone betraying his impatience for the soldier's 
	formality.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pontifex, my Archon sends me to bring you word, the summoning chamber is 
	prepared. We have pacified and secured the surrounding area to your 
	specifications.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;And the chamber itself? Has it been warded?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The soldier inclined his head again. &quot;As you ordered, Pontifex. The wards 
	have been tested twice, and we are confident that it has been properly 
	screened from all outside attention.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Maegris nodded in satisfaction. &quot;That is well done. I want you to keep 
	testing the wards. Pheraion is a crafty devil, have him try to defeat the 
	wards from his own location. We must be absolutely certain that there will 
	be no interference, from the Shadow Hunters or from... our new-made 
	friends.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It shall be so, Pontifex. Is there anything else you require?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Maegris' eyes slid briefly to the tankard on his table. &quot;Yes. Another flagon 
	of ale. The Tusker Spit Ale. And a flagon of the Hunter's Stock Amber.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes, Pontifex.&quot; The soldier stood, bowed quickly, pivoted smartly on his 
	heel, and strode out of the room. The door closed behind him, and Maegris 
	bent over his notes again.<br>
	<br>
	A few minutes later, there was another knock on his door. Without turning 
	around, Maegris called, &quot;Come in. Just find some flat space to set down the 
	flagons, and begone.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The door swung open behind him, but he heard no footsteps to indicate that 
	someone had entered the room. Irritated, Maegris swung around, ready to 
	scold or hex the person disturbing him.<br>
	<br>
	The youngest of his assistants, robed in black, stood in the doorway. He 
	clutched a sealed scroll case in his hand. Maegris noted the color pattern 
	of the tube, and his eyes widened.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Is that what I think it is, Angbarin?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The younger mage nodded hesitantly. &quot;I have not opened it, Pontifex, but 
	yes, the courier brought this from... ah, from...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Maegris snapped his fingers. &quot;All right man, I can see where it came from. 
	It is well you did not open it.&quot; He held out his hand. &quot;Give it to me, and 
	go. Make sure the flagons I requested get here, soon. I suspect I shall need 
	them more than ever now.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Angbarin shuffled forward, deposited the scroll case in Maegris' 
	outstretched hand, bowed deeply, and almost ran out the door.<br>
	<br>
	Maegris set the scroll case on the table in front of him, smudging the ink 
	on the diagram he'd been creating. He looked at it with almost superstitious 
	dread. His mind was racing. All the long preparation, all the searching, the 
	research that had been equal parts tedium, frustration, and soul-threatening 
	danger...<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I never thought they would actually...&quot; Then, taking a deep steadying 
	breath, he broke the seal and removed the cap from one end.<br>
	<br>
	He pulled out a thin stack of papers, written in a precise hand, with 
	skillfully rendered diagrams. Leafing through the papers, he almost forgot 
	to breathe. It looked proper, all in order. All the information he needed to 
	finish... A third knock on his door brought him back to his senses. &quot;Enter,&quot; 
	he croaked.<br>
	<br>
	Angbarin was there again, with a pair of heavy flagons on a platter. He 
	quickly found a place to set down the flagons, on top of a pile of books 
	that Maegris hadn't touched in a few days. Then he turned towards his 
	Pontifex, an unspoken question in his eyes.<br>
	<br>
	Maegris nodded, and the assistant smiled.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's what we've been waiting for, isn't it, Pontifex?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It is. Be careful what you wish for, Angbarin. It just may come true...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The young mage was confused. &quot;Pontifex?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Maegris shook his head. &quot;Never mind. I've just been up too long. We have 
	what we need. Call your brothers. Make them begin their preparations. 
	Assemble them in the chamber. We must move quickly. We are so close...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He could tell that his assistant still had something to say. &quot;Out with it, 
	Angbarin.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Pontifex... Were we not supposed to send a message of our own, in response? 
	The agreement...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Maegris waved his hand. &quot;I remember the agreement.&quot; He looked at a sealed 
	scroll case in his own bookshelf. He'd prepared its contents in advance, 
	even though he'd never truly believed that his counterpart would fulfill the 
	other end of the bargain. It contained nothing more than a location and 
	instructions on how to get there. He looked at the elegantly inscribed 
	papers on his desk, and the scroll case on his bookshelf. He thought of his 
	counterpart, and sneered.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes, we had an agreement. We should respond.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Angbarin saw the scroll case on the bookshelf and took a step in that 
	direction.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No,&quot; Maegris said. &quot;Not that. I'll write a new letter to be delivered to 
	our friend. I shall have to inform them that our old agreement has been 
	voided, since we learned of his past deceptions. But he will not go wanting. 
	He'll get what he deserves from the Heart-Render himself. He shall be 
	unhappy, I imagine, but he must learn to live with disappointment. As have 
	we all.&quot; He smiled a treacherous smile. Angbarin's own smile was much more 
	hesitant. A fearful, nervous smile.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As you say, Pontifex. You know best, I am sure.&quot;</p>

	<p>The messenger scrabbled over rock and scrub, breathing hard. Each 
	handhold and foothold was accompanied by a cascade of pebbles, clattering 
	down the slope beneath. He cursed at all the noise he was making. He knew he 
	was being pursued, and while his dark clothing would help conceal him in the 
	light of a moonless night, all the noise meant that he may as well be 
	calling out, &quot;Here! Here I am!&quot; to his pursuers.<br>
	<br>
	He had been running since the morning, when dawn's first light revealed the 
	spire over the Caul. He had run to his field commander, who had then 
	dispatched him to the mainland to deliver a message to the chapterhouse. 
	From the chapterhouse, with only a brief rest to recover his strength, he 
	had been sent through a portal into this wilderness, to deliver more 
	messages. It seemed that the entire Ordina had mobilized all across Dereth. 
	He knew he was one of many messengers crisscrossing the known world, 
	scurrying from the Caul to the Direlands to the frigid wastes of the 
	Halaetan Islands. He counted his blessings – his task was to deliver 
	messages and supplies to Ordina mages and scholars in isolated outposts. At 
	least he'd not been the one sent to trade messages with those disturbing 
	cultists, the ones who worshipped death and darkness with madness in their 
	eyes. He also knew that the Ordina was not the only organization thrown into 
	a flurry of activity. Even the unaligned were re-ordering their houses, 
	checking loyalties, mustering for the battles to come...<br>
	<br>
	Grimacing, he pulled himself onto a relatively flat outcropping of rock on 
	the face of the slope. He allowed himself a brief rest, scanning the terrain 
	below his perch to see if he could spot any sign of pursuit. He had been 
	blessed with a hunter's sharp eyes, and the Ordina had helped him further 
	develop his skills. He noted a stir in the low trees, a few hundred yards 
	from the bottom of the slope. As he suspected, his pursuers were gaining on 
	him as he struggled up the ridge. He only hoped that his decision to 
	sacrifice stealth for speed would pay off once he topped the crest.<br>
	<br>
	He drew from his pack a bottle of honey-colored potion. He flicked the cap 
	off with his thumb and gulped the bottle down, feeling the tingle in his 
	arms and legs as the potion burned away his fatigue. He set the bottle down 
	on the ledge and re-started his ascent. The crest of the ridge was not too 
	far above him now. He'd get back on even ground and then vanish into the 
	trees before whoever was chasing him could see where he went.<br>
	<br>
	He was just a few handholds away from the top when he heard a whoosh and 
	moist, meaty thunk just underneath him. Pain followed immediately after the 
	sound – a hot explosion of agony in his left leg. He spared a glance down 
	over his shoulder, and saw an arrow sticking out from the back of his thigh. 
	He almost cried out in fear and rage. Gritting his teeth, he pulled himself 
	up the last few handholds, over the crest of the ridge and into the cover of 
	some scrubby bushes. Trying to distance himself from the pain, he picked up 
	a loose twig from the brush surrounding him. He bit down on the twig, then 
	snapped the arrow shaft, leaving most of it still buried in his thigh. He 
	bit through the twig and almost passed out from the pain, but somehow 
	managed to roll to a crouching position.<br>
	<br>
	The wound changed his thinking. How could he hope to evade this pursuit with 
	a wounded leg, trailing blood at each step? More than that, he was tired of 
	running. He'd joined the Ordina to fight, not to run. He decided to find a 
	suitable spot, and prepare an ambush. He would become the hunter again, 
	rather than the prey.<br>
	<br>
	He moved towards the trees to the west with a lopsided loping stride, 
	ignoring the ripping pain in each stride. He took cover in a dense copse of 
	evergreens, sheltered on the north and west by large boulders. To the east, 
	in the direction his pursuers would come from, were long stretches of mostly 
	open ground. He'd have some natural cover and a clear shot at his enemies 
	from here, including a view of the ridge crest he'd just come over.<br>
	<br>
	He sat as comfortably as he could, strung his bow and scanned the horizon, 
	ready to give back some of what he'd gotten. He was a good archer and an 
	accomplished hunter, and it made him feel stronger just to have the weapon 
	in his hand. &quot;Come out, dogs, I have a surprise for you,&quot; he whispered.<br>
	<br>
	There was a twitch in the bushes that he'd just come out of, a couple of 
	hundred yards to the east. In a heartbeat, he loosed an arrow. Another 
	movement, to the southeast. He loosed another arrow. There was a third 
	movement, between the first two. He shot again, and he started to wonder 
	just how many people were after him. He saw no evidence that he'd hit 
	anything with his shots, and frustration and fear threatened to overtake him 
	again.<br>
	<br>
	He drew another arrow from his quiver, nocked it, and waited. &quot;Come on come 
	on come on,&quot; he muttered impatiently.<br>
	<br>
	There was a crash behind him. Before he could spin to confront the threat, 
	something heavy landed on his back, pinning him down, and a strong arm 
	wrapped around his neck from the left side. He felt hot breath on the back 
	of his head. He heard someone whisper, &quot;An impatient scout is a dead scout.&quot; 
	From the darkness to his right, a purple blade flashed brightly, then darted 
	towards him with the speed of a striking snake.</p>

	<p>May 2006 Letter to the Players<br>
	<br>
	Hi there and welcome to the May 2006 edition of the Letter to the Players. 
	It has been a tumultuous time in Dereth this month as Count Dardante has 
	been seen around Dereth with his experiment, Commander Jared Kurth. These 
	sightings have caused many to choose sides it what appears to be an 
	impending epic war between King Varicci and Queen Elysa. Which side are you 
	on?<br>
	<br>
	In the midst of this great conflict an old but familiar sight has arisen 
	from the ashes, yet no one is quite sure where this Spire came from or why 
	it is here? Does it mean that a dark evil is rising? Has the great conflict 
	between kingdoms awoken something sinister? Or is there something else 
	happening here? Have the magic's that Count Dardante continues to toy with 
	finally made some force greater than him aware of what he is doing? There 
	are alot of questions that need to be answered. <br>
	<br>
	As we settle in to the summer season, what is in store for Dereth? With a 
	great conflict on the horizon is Dereth about to be thrown into something it 
	is not ready for? Will the brave warriors of this land once again step up 
	and save the day, or does this mark the beginning of the end for Dereth as 
	we know it?<br>
	<br>
	Let's find out what is new in Dereth this month!<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Functionality</b><br>
	This month we are introducing the allegiance changes that have been proposed 
	for some time now. These changes include more allegiance officers with more 
	control, including being able to name the different ranks of officers. 
	Monarchs and officers will also have the ability to name the allegiance and 
	the ability to lock the allegiance, so that monarchs and officers can have 
	more control over who gets into an allegiance. Here is a more detailed 
	explanation of the new and improved allegiance system.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Names</b><br>
	The first aspect of the improvements we will cover today is the ability to 
	give your allegiance its own unique name. The monarch of the allegiance or 
	an officer with the appropriate permissions may set the name of the 
	allegiance once every 24 hours using the command @allegiance name set . The 
	name of the allegiance may be changed once every 24 hours, by a person with 
	the appropriate permissions, which we will cover more in the allegiance 
	officers section of this report. Allegiance names may be 40 characters long 
	and may consist only of characters that can be used in character names: that 
	is, alphabetic characters, spaces, and normal punctuation only (' and -).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Officers</b><br>
	For some time now players have been asking us for more structure and control 
	over what goes on in allegiances. These requests include giving allegiance 
	officers more abilities and a better system then what had been in place. 
	Well, ask and you shall receive! Below I will list the officer ranks and the 
	powers that go along with them. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 1</b>: Speaker<br>
	Allegiance chat kick.<br>
	Allegiance chat gag.<br>
	Allegiance broadcast.<br>
	Set/clear the MOTD.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 2</b>: Seneschal<br>
	Promote/demote members under own rank <br>
	(i.e. can promote/demote speakers). <br>
	Allegiance boot. <br>
	Allegiance ban. <br>
	Access allegiance info.<br>
	Lock/unlock the allegiance.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 3</b>: Castellan<br>
	Promote/demote members to any rank, including other Castellans.<br>
	Change officer titles.<br>
	Set/clear the allegiance name. <br>
	Set allegiance bind stone. <br>
	Change mansion allegiance access/storage permissions. <br>
	Bypass allegiance lock with own vassals. <br>
	Bypass allegiance lock by approving particular vassals.<br>
	<br>
	The monarch and officers with appropriate permissions can appoint officers 
	or remove officers as described in the table above. In other words: <br>
	<br>
	3 The monarch can appoint or remove any officer of any level.<br>
	3 Castellan (level 3) officers can appoint or remove any officer of any 
	level.<br>
	3 Seneschal (level 2) officers can appoint or remove Speakers. <br>
	3 Speaker (level 1) officers cannot appoint or remove anyone at this time.
	<br>
	<br>
	Any member of the allegiance may become an officer. An allegiance may have a 
	maximum of 12 officers at once (not counting the monarch, who is not 
	considered an officer), but those 12 officers may have any level of 
	permission. For instance, there may be 12 speakers, or 6 speakers and 6 
	seneschals, or what have you. <br>
	<br>
	In addition, at any time a member of the allegiance can find out who the 
	officers of that allegiance are by typing in the command @allegiance officer 
	or @allegiance officer list.<br>
	Either command will display a list of allegiance member names in no 
	particular order followed by their officer title.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Custom Officer Titles</b><br>
	In order to help customize allegiances, the monarch and officers with 
	appropriate permissions can rename the officer levels in whatever fashion 
	they desire – so long as those names meet the following two criteria:<br>
	3 The new title must be no longer than 20 characters. <br>
	3 The new title must consist alphabetic characters and normal punctuation 
	(namely ' and -) only.<br>
	3 The new title must not be profane, as determined by the chat language 
	filter. <br>
	<br>
	Note that officer titles may contain spaces and capital letters. If an 
	allegiance has not set a custom name for an officer level, the default title 
	is used.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Chat Gag</b><br>
	As you may have noticed, there are some abilities listed above that were not 
	available before. One of these is the allegiance chat gag. The monarch or 
	any officer of Speaker level or above may temporarily prevent any allegiance 
	member from participating in allegiance chat by entering a command. By 
	default, this gag will last 5 minutes and then wear off. An officer or the 
	monarch may explicitly end this gag early, if they so choose. Note that 
	officers may gag each other or even the monarch, but that a gagged officer 
	can always just turn around and ungag himself immediately. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Lock</b><br>
	Another ability that was once not available is the ability to lock an 
	allegiance. The monarch of the allegiance or an officer with the appropriate 
	permissions may lock or unlock the allegiance. In addition, any member of 
	the allegiance can see the current state by entering in a command. 
	Allegiances are unlocked by default, to match existing behavior. When the 
	allegiance is unlocked, new players may swear into the allegiance in the 
	normal fashion. When the allegiance is locked, however, only the monarch and 
	officers with the appropriate permissions may accept offers of allegiance. 
	If a player swears allegiance to a monarch or Castellan-level officer in a 
	locked allegiance, the action proceeds as normal. But if a player attempts 
	to swear allegiance to a lower-level officer or non-officer in a locked 
	allegiance, then the swear attempt will fail.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Higher tier weapons</b><br>
	This month will bring in the next tier of the Runed weapons that are found 
	around Dereth. These weapons will have the same cast on strike abilities as 
	the previous tier, but they are intended for characters around level 120. 
	This of course means the damage these weapons do is increased from the last 
	set that was released in the April event. These new weapons will appear in 
	chests that are found in areas geared towards the same level range as the 
	weapons. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. With each 
	monthly event we will be discussing an in concept topic, in order to give 
	you as much information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	Equipment Sets<br>
	Equipment sets are just what they sound like. A set of equipment that when 
	equipped will cast certain spells on the wearer. So if a player equips two 
	pieces of a set he gets certain spells cast on him, but when he equips more 
	items in the set, the spells are increased. If the person wears the whole 
	set, they will then receive a bonus spell or effect that is cast only when 
	the person is wearing a complete set. <br>
	<br>
	As we get closer to implementing these features, we will be giving a more 
	detailed description of what these equipment sets will involve.<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	May and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	May event. </p>
