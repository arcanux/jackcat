    <p>Couple of things today...<br>
    <br>
    <b>September Update<br>
    </b>Well the update is done and seems to be working pretty smoothly. Again I 
    want to point out the tremendous effort the Development Team and the QA team 
    did to get this done for this month. Very happy we made it and I hope you 
    are all enjoying it. We're tracking a couple small issues right now and 
    might do another small publish next week if we need to. <br>
    <br>
    We're currently finishing our documentation for the October update. I don't 
    want to give anything away yet. It'll probably be a little smaller than this 
    update, but I think you'll like what we have in store.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Forums</b><br>
    I'm curious to know what you all think of opening an &quot;off-topic&quot; forum. Most 
    of our other sites here at Turbine have these and I find them to be a pretty 
    cool way for people to chat and interact about things other than the game. 
    We'd moderate this forum just like we do all others and we'd ask people to 
    keep controversial topics out of the forum. So what do you think?<br>

    Glad you enjoyed it. The whole team was involved with the &quot;Red Dawn&quot; flavor 
    of the Marae rebels, but Ibn was the one who pushed for the idea in our 
    story meetings for the September event.<br>

    Maybe we should keep putting out game content based on 80s movies. Next up:

    In order to perform some upgrades to our database we will need to bring the 
    servers down on Tuesday, September 27th starting at 6am EDT until 6pm EDT. 
    We apologize for the extended downtime, however this is a fairly involved 
    and important process. We will update you again should the downtime last any 
    longer.<br>

	<br>
	<b>Server Downtime</b><br>
	The hardware upgrade is going well. For those of you who were asking, the 
	upgrade is to resolve a problem we found after investigating the cause of 
	the Wednesday downtime. This upgrade should resolve that problem so it 
	hopefully won't happen again. It will probably be mostly transparent to you 
	all as far as day-to-day gameplay goes. At this time we are on schedule, but 
	if that changes we will let you know.<br>

    <p><b>Daily Update</b> -<b> 9/29/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=244297#post244297">by 
	Calandryll</a>)<p><b>October Update<br>
	</b>Documentation is nearly complete and we’ve already started working on 
	test plans. Should have some information about the content next week.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Upcoming Downtime</b><br>
	This is probably the last thing any of you want to hear about, but the 
	situation with our database hardware isn’t resolved yet. We’re scheduling 
	another downtime for Wednesday, October 5th. This downtime will start at 4am 
	EDT and last until 8pm EDT. I know this is another long downtime and I 
	wanted to give you all an explanation for this.<br>
	<br>
	During the AC1 game server reboots and security updates on Monday September 
	12th, there was an error on the database servers during the reboot. We 
	therefore scheduled on-site maintenance to work on the inactive database 
	server on Wednesday September 14th.<br>
	<br>
	During that downtime, maintenance was performed on the inactive database 
	server. However, when the server was brought back online, we encountered 
	another error. This error caused the database corruption that resulted in 
	the rollback. At the end of this, we were only able to bring up one of the 
	two database servers, resulting in the additional downtime on September 
	27th.<br>
	<br>
	The maintenance window on September 27th did not go badly. It simply was not 
	enough time to adequately troubleshoot and solve the issue. We executed our 
	original plan, but it uncovered a hardware issue which we were unable to 
	resolve in the time allotted for the downtime. This is why the downtime 
	lasted longer than expected and it’s why we have to schedule another 
	downtime.<br>
	<br>
	To ensure that we do not have any reoccurrences of the September 14th 
	downtime, it is best to have the worlds down while these issues are 
	investigated and corrected.<br>
	<br>
	We’ll keep you updated on the progress of this fix. Again, my apologies for 
	the downtime, but it is necessary in order to ensure a stable experience for 
	all of you.<br>

	Calandryll</a>)<p>A few things for today...<br>
	<br>
	Some of you have been asking about the team. While we never discuss the 
	exact makeup or team size there are a few things I can tell you. Right now 
	the team is smaller than it was in CA. Part of that is because of the move, 
	but most of it is because we aren't currently working on an expansion so 
	there is no need for such a large team. We are still working to backfill a 
	couple of positions though in order to have enough people to fully support 
	good monthly content. Speaking of which...<br>
	<br>
	<b>October Update<br>
	</b>Still tracking well on this. We should be able to post some details this 
	week.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Wednesday Maintenance</b><br>
	This is still scheduled for Wednesday. Hopefully we won't need all of the 
	scheduled time. We'll keep you posted as we know more.<br>

    <br>
    <b>October Update</b><br>
    The October update is still looking good. We had a status meeting this 
    afternoon to go over everything. We’re a little behind because of the move, 
    but I think we can make up that time easily enough. We’re probably going to 
    share some of the content with you a little earlier than we normally do so 
    you should start seeing some updates by the end of the week!<br>
    <br>
    Tomorrow's Daily Update will have more information on some of the open 
    issues we've been talking about in recent weeks. You'll also be hearing from 
    some of the development team folks in the coming days too!<br>

	Calandryll</a>)<p>For today's update, I’d like to talk about some of the 
	topics that many of you have been asking about on the forums. Not everything 
	is nailed down yet, but I did want to share the information that I do have.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Dawnsong</b><br>
	Turbine will be centralizing support for all Asheron’s Call subscribers at 
	our MA offices in a few months. Therefore, the Dawnsong server will not be 
	opened as originally planned. Adding a new server would further spread 
	players out and splinter existing communities. We understand that some of 
	you were looking forward to this server; however at this time we feel that 
	opening another server would not be good for Asheron’s Call.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Face Artwork</b><br>
	At this time, the artwork for the faces isn’t going to change. While we 
	understand that some players do not like the new looks, we cannot rework all 
	of the faces. However, we are discussing adding the ability for players to 
	change their look in game. This is something we are currently investigating 
	but it won’t be part of the October publish. Right now this is not 
	scheduled, but I will update you on this as we move forward.<br>
	<br>
	<b>High Resolution Textures</b><br>
	The high resolution textures are not ready yet, however we still intend to 
	get these in the game. After further investigating the status of this, we 
	need to do some more engineering work and they need a full QA pass. The QA 
	pass is very important (and a bit time-consuming) to ensure the new textures 
	do not cause crashes with certain graphics cards. I don’t have an ETA for 
	this yet, but it is still on our “to do” list.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Today’s Maintenance</b><br>
	So far everything is moving along smoothly. The Ops team tells me we are on 
	schedule. I’ll update you more as I get more information.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Hiring</b><br>
	We’re currently in the process of hiring an engineer (programmer), a 
	designer, and a QA person for Asheron’s Call in order to fill out the team. 
	You should see the job descriptions on the Turbine site in the coming days. 
	We’re also interviewing some internal candidates for these positions as 
	well. More on that as the hiring process progresses.<br>
	<br>
	<b>October Update</b><br>
	The October update is still looking good. We’re about code complete and then 
	we’ll swing into full QA mode. We have an article planned for later this 
	week to give you a quick look at some of the update.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events</b><br>
	Some more good news. After getting a lot of positive feedback about the 
	events, we have decided to continue these for the foreseeable future. So 
	we’ll be doing both game content updates AND live events from now on!<br>

	nice to fix the problem AND finish early. <br>

	We have a status meeting later today to go over the schedule. I still think

	in the meeting. We'll have a good ETA for the publish next week.<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<b>Community Relations</b><br>
	Some of you may have noticed that Frelorn has been more active today on the 
	boards. He's going to be your main point of contact on the forums, although 
	I will continue to write the Daily Updates. I know sometimes these updates 
	aren't as full of information as other times, but that's going to be the 
	case if I continue to do them daily. Sometimes there just isn't a lot to 
	report. That said, I still think there is value in doing them every day so I 
	am going to continue to do so.<br>
	<br>
	Hope everyone has a great weekend!<br>

	<b>October Update</b><br>
	Still looking good. We ran into some art issues with the festival stuff and 
	the updated graphics (mostly the trees don't look quite right), but we think 
	we have a fix for that. Other than that, everything is shaping up nicely.<br>

	Not much to update today. We had perform a quick maintenance to our login

	back up and running.<br>
	<br>
	We also had to bring down the forums today for a short time in order to do

	maintenance, some ISP's make take a little while to update their cached

    <p><b>I'm Back on the AC Design Team</b> -<b> 10/13/05</b> (<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?&amp;postid=246997#post246997">by 
	Speed</a>)<p>Hey everyone, I wanted to drop a line and let you know that 
	I’ve returned to the AC1 Live Team. I’ve never been a big poster so most of 
	you may not remember me. I’ve worked on the Live Team on and off in one 
	capacity or another since AC’s Launch.<br>
	<br>
	Background: I started out on the QA Team and eventually moved into the roll 
	of AC1 Data Integrator where I made sure that the designer’s quests and 
	quest data made it into the game. I tried my hand at content whenever I 
	could, starting out mostly with housing items and Ulgrim the Unpleasant. 
	Interestingly enough Crowley who I’m working with now was the original 
	creator of Ulgrim. Expect more Ulgrim strings! After awhile I started making 
	small quests and dungeons and became a sortof Designer/Integrator. Really 
	everyone on the team had multiple hats anyway. Scenario created lots of 
	content as did Srand and Ibin. Man those were fun times. Before the game 
	moved out to LA I had become a full time designer. I unfortunately was 
	unable to go to LA since I didn’t want to leave my family here in New 
	England.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You may know me from such content as:<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim’s Monthly Sayings<br>
	<br>
	Flag Quest: Grievver Hive with the Spinning Grievver, good old Grievver 
	Scholar<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim’s Island<br>
	<br>
	Blind Snowman<br>
	<br>
	I did the rolling balls of death mechanics for the Gaerlan Arc<br>
	<br>
	Snowman Village<br>
	<br>
	I worked with Todd on the rebuild of Arwic<br>
	<br>
	Candeth Keep and the Stronghold collectors<br>
	<br>
	Fishing<br>
	<br>
	Implemented Chris Foster’s Tekapuapuh and his Putiputipuh grub Quest (aka A 
	boy and his Grub)<br>
	<br>
	Past Masks – I’m working on Masks for this October too<br>
	<br>
	Gareth Dain’s Dissapearance<br>
	<br>
	Renegade Garrison – The Lugian Garrison attacked by the Olthoi<br>
	<br>
	Skeleton Castle – Baron Nuvillus and his crown<br>
	<br>
	The Quest Gems – Drudge Fight, The Homunculus, Resting Place, Dark Towers, 
	The Gibbering, Coin of Attachment<br>
	<br>
	I had been working on AC2 for a bit after the AC1 team went to LA and then I 
	went back to AC1 QA for a bit, which is where I was when we found out that 
	the AC1 team was coming back east. I’m really happy to have the Live Team 
	back here in Westwood. If you can’t tell by my history with Asheron’s Call, 
	I love the game and it’s players. It’s very unique in it’s design and feel 
	in the MMO space and I hope to keep it that way and create some fun content. 
	I’m sure you’ll let me know if I jump the reedshark.<br>
	<br>
	As Ulgrim would say, “What are you doing just standing there for? Go fetch 
	me some stout! I’ve got important stuff I’m working on, with complicated 
	circuits and things that are beyond your primitive intellects.” Well, that’s 
	Ulgrim, not me. Have fun, I’m going back to work!<br>

	Calandryll</a>)<p>A couple of things today.<br>
	<br>
	<b>October Update<br>
	</b>We're fixing bugs now in this update. We had hoped to get this update 
	published next week, but it will more than likely be the week after that. So 
	we'll be posting another teaser tomorrow and then the LttP next week.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Team</b><br>
	Many of you probably already saw
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?t=26253">
	Speed's</a> (AC designer) post. We're very happy to have him back on the 
	team. Wait until you see some of the stuff he has done for October! The 
	other piece of news is that I've been asked to remain on as the Live 
	Producer for Asheron's Call. I'm very excited about this opportunity and I 
	think my background in both Production and Community Relations should come 
	in handy. I look forward to working with all of you to make AC even better! 
	Frelorn will be continuing to take the lead on Community Relations updates 
	for AC.<br>

	Calandryll</a>)<p>A bunch of things today!<br>
	<br>
	<b>October Publish</b><br>
	We're scheduling the October Publish for October 26th. It took us a little 
	longer to get some of the new masks in the game but I think once you see 
	them you'll agree it's worth the wait. We'll be posting the LttP later next 
	week.<br>
	<br>
	<b>October Publish Teaser</b><br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=409">
	<font color="#FFCC66">This is so cool</font></a>, it really doesn't need an 
	introduction. Enjoy! <br>
	<br>
	<b>Decal</b><br>
	The Decal developers have announced they are starting their public Alpha. 
	You can read the announcement
	<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.acdev.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3388">
	here</a>. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Respec Gems</b><br>
	We've decided to lower the timer on respec gems. This won't be in the 
	October Publish, but it should make it for November. More on that after we 
	finish the October Publish.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Events<br>
	</b><a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=408">More 
	information about Mr. P</a>! Ok yea, it's silly, but we're having fun with 
	the little guy and it seems like most of you are as well. Look for more 
	&quot;serious&quot; write-ups next week. <br>

	looking good. We've also starting writing our documents for the November 
	update as well.<br>
	<br>
	I saw some discussion about the respec timer after we posted that we're 
	planning on lowering it. I'd like to ask for your feedback on this before we 
	actually do it. Looking for both pros and cons as well as how long you think 
	it should be.<br>

	far. <br>
	<br>
	Not much to report today. We appreciate all of the feedback you have given 
	us so far on what you think should be done with the respec gems/timers. This 
	is something that we know is important to you. While we were looking at 
	doing something for November on this, we would rather take the time to make 
	sure whatever changes we make are the best for everyone. Based on the 
	feedback we have gotten so far we will be looking into more solutions for 
	this issue, including redoing the entire way the quest is done. <br>
	<br>
	Other than that, things are still looking good for the October event.<br>
