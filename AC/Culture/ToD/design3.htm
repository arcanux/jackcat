	<img border="0" src="design/icon7.gif" width="16" height="16">Geneva's 
	Trade Requests<span lang="en-us"> - Schedule</span>!</font></b><p><font size="2" face="arial">What exactly is Geneva's Trade 
	Requests? I'm glad you asked. Here's how the event will work. <br>
	<br>
	I will setup in one of the starter towns and I'll send out a &quot;Trade Request&quot; 
	on General Chat. The Trade Request will involve one of the tradeskills in 
	Dereth and I ask you, the players, to fulfill my Trade Request. Trade 
	Requests will involve Cooking, Alchemy and the Tinkering skills. For each 
	Trade Request I make, you will have 15 minutes to fill the request. Once the 
	15 minutes is up, I will issue another Trade Request. Here's an example:<br>
	<br>
	<b>[Trade] +Geneva says, &quot;Trade Request: Cooking! Please bring me a large 
	pizza with extra Drudge Sausage! You have 15 minutes.&quot;</b><br>
	<br>
	You must then whip up a Large pizza with extra Drudge Sausage and bring it 
	to me. <br>
	<br>
	I will send out alerts every 5 minutes on Tradel chat as we draw closer to 
	the 15 minute limit for each request so you are aware of how much time you 
	have left to make me the pizza.<br>
	<br>
	Each player that brings me a pizza and drops it in a trade window will win a 
	prize. These prizes are pre-determined depending on what tradeskill the 
	request involves. For example each Cooking Trade Request has a set reward. 
	But wait...there's more! Not only will you get the Cooking set reward for 
	bringing me the pizza, but you will also get a second reward, and YOU will 
	determine that prize. How you ask?<br>
	<br>
	I have created a list of 100 rewards. After seeing your item in a trade 
	window that fulfills my Trade Request I will ask you to pick a number 
	between 1 and 100. You will need to send me your number choice through a 
	tell. I will then check the list to see what prize is listed at your number 
	choice and you will get that prize as well!<br>
	<br>
	After a player chooses a number and gets their prizes, the list will shuffle 
	around. The items will not change, but they will now be associated with 
	different numbers. This means that the prize at number 73 for one player may 
	not be the same prize for the next player that chooses 73. <br>
	<br>
	I would prefer that any item traded to me during the event is given to me by 
	the character that made the item (your Cook, your Alchemist etc). I won't 
	enforce this because I realize some trademules may have a rare running and I 
	don't want that to expire in order for you to participate in the event. 
	Brush the dust off those mules and bring them out of the basement into the 
	Derethian sun for an event that has their name written all over it!<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>Darktide</b></u><br>
	Geneva's Trade Requests will be run differently on Darktide. I don't want 
	players to be standing around only to get slaughtered by a roving band of 
	thugs. So, if you complete a Trade Request on Darktide, send me a tell and I 
	will teleport to your location (the safety of your house for example) to 
	complete the trade and for you to choose your random number.<br>
	<br>
	<u><b>SCHEDULE</b></u><br>
	Frostfell * Sun Aug 5th - 9pm EST<br>
	Harvestgain * Sun Aug 5th - 10:30pm EST<br>
	Leafcull * Mon Aug 6th - 9pm EST<br>
	Morningthaw * Mon Aug 6th - 10:30pm EST<br>
	Solclaim * Tue Aug 7th - 9pm EST<br>
	Thistledown * Tue Aug 7th - 10:30pm EST<br>
	Verdantine * Wed Aug 8th - 9pm EST<br>
	Wintersebb * Wed Aug 8th - 10:30pm EST<br>
	Darktide * Thu Aug 9th - 9pm EST<br>
	<br>
	After the scheduled events are run, I will be hosting Geneva's Trade 
	Requests at random times in the future. I think this event will be alot of 
	fun and some of the rewards on the 1-100 list are quite nice. </font><b><font size="2" face="arial">
