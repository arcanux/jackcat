	October 12, 2007</font></span></p>
	<p>
    Ardry reclined on his bedroll by the fire, sipping from a mug of tea. He 
	sighed contentedly and looked up to count the stars of Dereth’s night sky. 
	They’d established this camp on one of the high ridges outside the town of 
	Al Jalima. They were, as far as Ardry could see, all alone out here in the 
	desert. With no dungeons to explore, no monstrous threats to battle, Ardry 
	was more relaxed than he’d been in at least a year.<br>
	<br>
	Ardry’s contemplation was interrupted by a clinking noise nearby, on the 
	other side of the camp fire. His uncle, Aliester the Loquacious, was fooling 
	around with some arcane piece of glassware and awkwardly scribbling notes 
	into a thick journal by the flickering light of the fire.<br>
	<br>
	“The daily temperature variance is fascinating! What could explain it? Do 
	you notice how cold it is, Ardry? Considerably more cold than one would 
	expect. After all, when one thinks of the desert, one thinks of heat and 
	sand, dehydration and burning thurst, the merciless heat of the sun and no 
	refuge under foliage…”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry shook his head. “Uncle, I told you before we left the cottage that the 
	desert gets cold at night.”<br>
	<br>
	“You could have spoken a little louder, or with greater urgency, nephew,” 
	Aliester the Loquacious huffed. “I don’t understand why we couldn’t just 
	spend our time at the cottage, finishing my experiments on those glands from 
	the warped Olthoi…”<br>
	<br>
	“Because then that wouldn’t be a vacation, Uncle. You and I have both earned 
	some time off from the demands of the council. Remember how long it took for 
	you to start eating food with bones in it, after your ordeal in the 
	graveyard?”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester was unable to resist glancing at the small pile of chicken bones by 
	the fire, remnants of the dinner they’d shared. The mere sight of a chicken 
	bone brought back vivid and awful memories of being ambushed and overwhelmed 
	by the spectral retainers of the undead Lady Tairla. He shuddered and looked 
	away.<br>
	<br>
	“Well, you may be right, my boy, but this is an awfully curious location for 
	a vacation. We could have chosen to visit cousin Ulgrim in Ayan Baqur, for 
	example. Or sampled the local brews in Cragstone, or visited the wonderful 
	archive just outside of Hebian To…” <br>
	<br>
	“I wanted some peace and quiet on this vacation, Uncle. The big towns are 
	too hectic for me. Especially now, with the festivals going on… And the last 
	time I visited cousin Ulgrim, he tried to stuff some kind of mashed-up herb 
	into my mouth, muttering nonsense about that Virindi archmage in Ayan Baqur. 
	I managed to get away from him, but I think he was trying to push me into a 
	hallucinatory state or something. He said he wanted to observe me.”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester chuckled. “I’m still not sure I believe that story, my boy. Usually 
	Ulgrim has a consistent and predictable route to his hallucinations.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry paused to take another sip of tea. “I like it here on the ridges. 
	We’re near enough to town to get supplies easily, but up here we can almost 
	pretend like there’s nothing else out there… No squabbling scholars waving 
	papers at us, no queens or lords or assassins sending us off to painful 
	deaths… Do you realize, Uncle, that we’ve been here on Dereth for almost 
	eight years and we’ve been scouting or researching threats to the realm with 
	almost no breaks in the entire time?”<br>
	<br>
	Aliester shrugged. He was well aware that his role of research and 
	experimentation had been considerably less rigorous over the years than 
	Ardry’s role of advance scout… “If you say so, nephew. Do you suppose I 
	could prevail upon you to stoke the fire a little higher, though? I can 
	barely see what I’m writing here.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry thought about trying to argue with his uncle. To convince him to put 
	away the book and just enjoy a quiet night free of the demands of the realm. 
	The anniversary of their arrival on Dereth always put him in a contemplative 
	mood.<br>
	<br>
	Finishing the last of the tea in his mug, he stood up. “The firewood’s 
	running low. I’ll head into town to get some more. Shouldn’t take more than 
	a few minutes.” He stooped to pick up his pack.<br>
	<br>
	Unexpectedly, Aliester stood up as well. “I’ll accompany you, my boy! I’d 
	relish a chance to stretch my legs, and perhaps the physical activity will 
	help warm me.”<br>
	<br>
	Ardry nodded as he shouldered his pack, pleased by the offer of company. “As 
	you say, Uncle.”<br>
	<br>
	“Besides,” Aliester muttered, just low enough that Ardry couldn’t hear, “I 
	don’t want to be left alone in the dark with those… bones.” He spared a 
	baleful glance at the pile of chicken bones and followed his nephew down off 
	the ridge.<br>
	<br>
	The two of them began walking, in contemplative silence, back towards town. 
	As they neared the road, the twinkling lights of the small town of Al Jalima 
	became visible. Ardry, sharp-eyed as he was, first noticed the crowd of 
	townsfolk on the road just outside of town, barely visible at the edge of 
	the town’s lights.<br>
	<br>
	“Strange to see such a large group of people out at this time of night…” he 
	said.<br>
	<br>
	Once Ardry pointed them out, Aliester was able to see them too. “Yes, quite 
	a crowd. Oh, they’ve noticed us. And they’re coming this way…” He squinted 
	to get a better look at the approaching crowd.<br>
	<br>
	“Pwyll’s bubbling blood! Run, Ardry! Tairla’s found me again!” Aliester 
	howled with terror, reversed direction and ran away, faster than Ardry had 
	ever seen him move.<br>
	<br>
	Looking back up the road at the approaching crowd, he could see that they 
	weren’t townsfolk at all. Nor were they the ghostly retainers of the undead 
	lady of the graveyard. But they were definitely undead…<br>
	<br>
	Cursing his luck, Ardry turned and ran, hot on his uncle’s footsteps.</p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The messenger strode swiftly through the 
	halls of the royal palace, headed for the map room. He stopped in front of a 
	pair of thick oaken doors, flanked by two guardsmen in the royal livery of 
	the House of Strathelar.<br>
	<br>
	“Message for General Tharnoch,” the messenger announced to the guards. He 
	showed them a roll of parchment sealed with black wax. One of the guards 
	pounded the butt of his spear against the door, and shortly afterward the 
	doors swung slowly open to reveal the fierce, craggy face of the aged 
	Aluvian warrior.<br>
	<br>
	“What have you got for us?” Tharnoch asked.<br>
	<br>
	The messenger clicked his heels together and bowed quickly. “Undead unrest 
	in Al Jalima, General.” He offered up his message scroll.<br>
	<br>
	“My thanks, soldier,” Tharnoch muttered as he took the scroll. “Go to the 
	armory about your boots, though, the heels click too much.” He snorted, gave 
	the soldier a dismissive nod, and closed the doors again.<br>
	<br>
	There was a soft laugh from the center of the room. Tharnoch turned away 
	from the doors as he broke the seal off the scroll and looked to the source 
	of the sound.<br>
	<br>
	“That was an unkind comment to that poor messenger, General,” Queen Elysa 
	said. She sat at the head of the great map table. Her son Prince Borelean 
	sat at her right side and a huge leather map of the realm of Dereth was on 
	the table before them. The map was dotted with colored pins and scraps of 
	paper bearing annotations. So far there were nine pins on the map, scattered 
	all around without any apparent pattern. To the side of the map, in front of 
	the unoccupied chair to the queen’s left, was a small wooden box that 
	emitted a faint glow.<br>
	<br>
	“I should not be so flippant with these youngsters, I know,” Tharnoch 
	conceded as he walked to the table, scanning the contents of the note. He 
	sat in the chair to the Queen’s left and handed her the note. “It’s been a 
	while since I had to deal with soldiers who actually cared enough about such 
	trivialities as to click their boot-heels together. That’s all.”<br>
	<br>
	“Is this incident of particular interest to us, General?” the Queen asked as 
	she took the note, glancing significantly at the annotated map in front of 
	them. “If undead are rising in Al Jalima, has our enemy perhaps found a way 
	to corrupt one of those into a… Prodigal?”<br>
	<br>
	Surprising both of the older people in the room, Prince Borelean spoke up. 
	“I highly doubt that the undead would fall prey to the crude manipulations 
	of the other Prodigals,” he said. “They seem to keep their own kingdom well 
	in line. Even if it’s a kingdom long extinct, that exists only in the 
	memories of walking corpses.”<br>
	<br>
	Queen Elysa stared at her son. “I had no idea you were so well-versed in the 
	politics of Dericost, my son.”<br>
	<br>
	“I know a great many things that may surprise you, mother,” Borelean said 
	through a thin smile.<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch cleared his throat before things could get any more tense between 
	the royal mother and son. “Majesty, I too doubt that this undead uprising is 
	related to the Aerbax problem. This does seem to be the season for such 
	unrest. These attacks always seem to come around this time of year. Remember 
	the reports we’ve been getting out of Glenden Wood, as well. While undead 
	assaulting Al Jalima is indeed a matter that requires our attention, it is 
	not the reason we are gathered in this room.”<br>
	<br>
	Queen Elysa turned away from her son to look at the general. “As you say, 
	General. Let us discuss the items your scouts brought back from the 
	laboratory on the Singularity Caul.”<br>
	<br>
	The general nodded in agreement and turned his attention to the small wooden 
	box on the table in front of him. “Let me show you something interesting, 
	Your Majesty.”<br>
	<br>
	He flipped open the clasp on the box and lifted the lid. As soon as he 
	lifted the lid, his face was bathed in purple light. There was also a 
	noticeable smell coming from the box, the pungent smell of dried herbs. The 
	old soldier put an uncharacteristically sly expression on his face as he 
	paused to make eye contact with both Elysa and Borelean. “Before we discuss 
	this,” he said to the Queen, “I must ask what we know about that archmage in 
	Ayan Baqur…”</font></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello and welcome the Release Notes for the October 
	event, Masked Memories! This month we see the return of the Festival season. 
	Once again it is a time of tricks and treats as we begin the journey into 
	the cold winter months. But let’s not forget that there is still much going 
	on around Dereth that has yet to be explained. Let’s see what else is going 
	this month in the world of Asheron’s Call. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Functionality and Content</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">We are on the cusp of celebrating the eighth 
		anniversary of Asheron’s Call. This is a huge event and we want to 
		celebrate in grand style. This year when players log in after the 
		October event goes live they will find they now have one more character 
		slot available to them. This is just a small way for us to say thank you 
		to everyone who is playing the game we all love. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Colosseum Currency has been added to the game 
		this month. Players will be rewarded for completing certain stages of 
		the Colosseum, see the table below for details. Players will receive 
		Colosseum currency from the Colosseum NPC on completion </span></li>

	You get flagged for completing a stage by using the door to the next stage. 
	For example, if you are in stage 13 you kill everything and then portal out, 
	you will not receive the reward of 1 coin for completing the stage. You must 
	use the door to the next stage in order to get credit for completing it. 
	Please note that you receive only the reward for the last stage that you 
	have completed. If you complete stage 14 and leave, you will receive 1 coin. 
	Once you have collected some coins you will be able to purchase special 
	items from a vendor placed in the Colosseum staging area. </span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Following tradition, new masks have been added 
		for the Festival season, collect them all! Don’t forget the Majestic 
		Pumpkin and the Festival vendors will also be making their return along 
		with the seasonal creatures we all know and love.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Players will want to start collecting Small 
		Olthoi Venom Sacs from the Olthoi North area. A vendor has moved in to 
		the area who has a keen interest in these items, and will reward players 
		who take the time to collect them. </span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><br>
	<b>Miscellaneous Changes and Improvements</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">For some time now, players have had the ability 
		to lock another player’s corpse. Thanks to some great work by the team, 
		we are confident that this has been fixed and players should no longer 
		be able to lock a corpse. That being said, we will continue to watch 
		this situation closely. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The all elusive behavior which would cause some 
		creatures to return back to home with full health mid combat has been 
		fixed. We will continue to watch this closely, but it appears we have 
		finally tracked this one down. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The War Spell Proc on the Paradox-touched Olthoi 
		Weapons was causing some unintended balance issues in PvP. In extreme 
		cases, the weapons would proc twice in a row and kill a player in two 
		hits. We have reduced the level of the spell that the weapons can cast 
		on strike from 7 to 4 and increased the proc rate of the spell to ensure 
		that the weapon damage remains the same, but the weapon loses the 
		ability to generate the massive burst damage that was unbalancing PvP.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">A bug with Issk in Old Yanshi that would allow 
		players to repeatedly hand in an item for the reward has been fixed and 
		Issk should be returning to his post in October. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">An issue with the portal that would send you in 
		to fight the Prodigal Olthoi Queen has been fixed and players once again 
		should be able to go in and fight the queen.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Penumbral Shadow Mages were using Healthbolts 
		(Hectacombs) and causing more player deaths than intended. We have 
		removed this spell from them and raised the chance for a normal war 
		spell to fire in order to keep the area at a high difficulty. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">A typo in the text that Collectors use in regards 
		to Drudge Cabalists has been fixed. <br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Based on player feedback we have changed the 
		amount of XP a player can receive from completing the Death Tail Fang 
		quest. Players will now receive up to 50% of their level up to 100 
		million XP. </span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us">So there are just some of the things we have in store 
	for Asheron's Call in October. Please remember that along with everything 
	listed here, there are several new quests and exciting things going into the 
	game for the October event.<br>
