	<p>
    <span lang="en-us">Adso crested the hill and looked out over the valley. 
	Wary of being spotted from below, he crouched down and made himself part of 
	the scraggly brush covering that topped this hill. Far beneath him, the 
	ruined Empyrean graveyard brooded in its own darkness. Even from this 
	distance, hidden by the valley’s perpetual black fog, he could make out the 
	movements of the many unnatural denizens of the graveyard. <br>
	<br>
	Roving patrols of the tormented dead and packs of huge rats, twisted by 
	their exposure to the unnatural grounds… He knew these enemies well. He’d 
	made numerous scouting expeditions into the heart of this graveyard to seek 
	out an artifact or to track down some long-dead noble that his Master sought 
	news of. He’d gained more than a few scars to show for all his trouble, and 
	he was not looking forward to the next trip. The target of his new search 
	was known to be powerful and unpredictable, and Adso hated dealing with such 
	a degree of uncertainty.<br>
	<br>
	From ten paces behind him came the sound of a rustling branch, too loud to 
	be caused by wind. He spun, blades out and ready to confront an enemy, when 
	Sabithra stepped out of brush cover. He relaxed slightly, but not 
	completely, as she approached with a grin on her face. Though she had risen 
	in Master’s estimation and trust, Adso still didn’t trust her, and wouldn’t 
	put it above her to knife him in the back to smooth her own path to 
	advancement within their small organization.<br>
	<br>
	“At ease, Adso,” Sabithra smirked when she noticed his tension. She raised 
	her hands and wiggled her fingers to show she was not carrying any weapons. 
	“We’re all friends here.”<br>
	<br>
	“You are no friend of mine, acolyte,” Adso muttered. He pointedly did not 
	sheathe his blades. “Your fieldcraft still wants improvement. I heard you 
	coming.”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra bowed with false modesty. “I am ever willing and eager to receive 
	training from my betters,” she said. “But I got close.” The glint in her 
	eyes showed the delight she took in tweaking his nose this way.<br>
	<br>
	Adso grunted, upset that he’d let himself show his irritation to Sabithra. 
	“Why are you here?”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra pulled a thin, rolled-up dispatch from her belt, sealed with red 
	wax and a device he knew well. He took it from her without a further word, 
	and read it.<br>
	<br>
	Without being asked, Sabithra began to elaborate. “It seems Master got word 
	that some other players seek an audience with Lord Rytheran. Master wishes 
	for you to suspend your original mission and take me with you to find 
	Rytheran to ensure that we get the item Master seeks, before servants of 
	some other interested party cozen it out of the undead lord.”<br>
	<br>
	Adso grimaced and looked up at her from his letter. “And did he tell you 
	what my mission is?”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra shrugged. “He told me the details were not important to me, but 
	scuttlebutt among the younger acolytes said that you were off to find the 
	Jester. That you were supposed to… talk to him. Get a story out of him. We 
	wondered what you’d done to get such a… choice assignment.” <br>
	<br>
	“Prying into missions that are not one’s own responsibility will eventually 
	get one killed,” Adso warned, as he finished reading the letter.<br>
	<br>
	“Provided one is an inferior fighter to one’s killers, one supposes,” 
	Sabithra quipped.<br>
	<br>
	Adso ignored that obvious bait and rolled up the letter. Unwilling to burn 
	this letter while he was attempting to maintain some cover, he settled for 
	ripping it into a few small pieces and eating them, chewing each piece 
	thoroughly and methodically.<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra watched with amusement, as if their Master’s very strict security 
	instructions were nothing to her. It didn’t make the letter go down any 
	easier.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, he was ready to set out into the graveyard. He scanned the horizon 
	one last time, then turned back to Sabithra. “Can you control your cockiness 
	long enough for an audience with Rytheran? I promise you he will not suffer 
	your impertinence. If you bungle this mission for us, I’ll send you back to 
	the lifestone myself.”<br>
	<br>
	Sabithra nodded seriously. “You know I am dedicated to the Master’s craft, 
	as dedicated as you are, Adso. I may joke around, but I remember myself when 
	the knives are out.”<br>
	<br>
	That would have to do. He nodded. “Fair enough. Follow me, then…” <br>
	<br>
	He led them by a side path off the hill, and towards the graveyard. He 
	relied on his past knowledge of the site to steer them past the most 
	dangerous concentrations of rats and undead. They moved low and quietly and 
	ducked behind cover as much as they could. They spent half an hour 
	cautiously making their way into the heart of the graveyard, and soon Adso 
	began to feel comfortable with Sabithra as a hunting partner. She was a 
	competent sneak and she had good reflexes and seemed to anticipate his own 
	moves, working in harmony with his leadership.<br>
	<br>
	He was so pleasantly surprised that he allowed himself to get complacent. As 
	they passed one set of ruined stones, she reached out absent-mindedly to 
	touch one stone in particular. He noticed her motion but didn’t think about 
	it… until her fingers left glowing traces on the stone’s smooth surface.<br>
	<br>
	He felt the blood drain out of his face as high-pitched laughter boomed out 
	above and behind them.<br>
	<br>
	“Joy! Someone’s come to help me clear my head!” The sound of jingling bells 
	had never sounded so menacing…<br>

	</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="1">June 19, 2008</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">An old woman, tired and 
	alone, stood in front of a stone altar. The set of her back was imperiously 
	high and proud, but she could not keep her shoulders from sagging or her 
	head from drooping periodically, out of sheer exhaustion. Her white hair was 
	close-cropped and she was dressed in a plain linen robe, spotted with brown 
	bloodstains on the sleeves and chest. The oblong room in which she stood was 
	lit only by a flickering candelabra positioned near the wall behind her. 
	Atop the altar in front of her was a wide silver bowl, filled with clear 
	water. She was staring intently into the water and muttering under her 
	breath, in words that only a handful of people would understand. She had 
	been looking into the placid, unchanging surface for hours. If she saw 
	anything in the water now, it was surely only illusions conjured by her 
	weary mind…<br>
	<br>
	Finally, Nuhmudira snorted in disgust and frustration and looked away from 
	the water vessel. Turning from the altar, she called out, “Brizinna!”<br>
	<br>
	A door opened in the far end of the room and a younger woman, dressed in 
	much cleaner linen robes, shuffled in. She had the pale blue skin of a 
	Viamontian and her hair was a bright, almost shocking red. As she came in 
	she snuck a glance at the older woman, standing suspended in her bubble of 
	candlelight with her altar and scrying bowl, surrounded on all sides by 
	darkness, and she couldn’t help shuddering at the image as she averted her 
	eyes and knelt in submission.<br>
	<br>
	“I am here to serve, teacher,” the younger woman murmured.<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira sneered. “Oh, stand up, woman. I didn’t pull you out of the 
	Varicci’s college of royal finger-wagglers so you could scuttle around on 
	your knees, bowing and scraping to everyone who’s older or more learned than 
	you.”<br>
	<br>
	Embarassed, Brizinna stood up with what dignity she could muster and asked, 
	“What would you have of me, teacher?”<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira gestured. “Come. Stand here, opposite me.” Brizinna quickly 
	complied, and came to stand on the opposite side of the altar from her 
	leader and mentor. She stood silently, looking off into a point in space 
	just above Nuhmudira’s left shoulder, not daring to meet the powerful mage’s 
	gaze. She was aware that Nuhmudira was watching her, seemed to be studying 
	her, almost like a cat studying a wounded bird before pouncing.<br>
	<br>
	“Give me your hand, Brizinna,” Nuhmudira said, in a soft and soothing voice. 
	Brizinna extended her right hand, palm down, and watched with fascination as 
	Nuhmudira took it into her own right hand. She had expected the elder 
	sorceress to have rough, callused hands, but her touch was warm and 
	comforting. She watched as Nuhmudira turned her hand over so that her palm 
	faced up. She belatedly realized that she was being lulled into a trance, 
	could almost feel the spell working on her, looked into her teacher’s face 
	and saw lips moving and forming near-silent syllables that were…<br>
	<br>
	She was broken from her stupor by a flash of pain in her palm, followed by a 
	gush of warmth that enveloped her whole hand. She gasped at the pain and 
	belatedly noticed the bronze knife in her teacher’s free hand... A free hand 
	that was wrapped in bloody white linen. Nuhmudira had pacified her senses 
	only to cut her palm open, and now her blood was dripping in hot pulses into 
	the silver bowl.<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira released her hand, almost as an afterthought. “There are strips of 
	cloth to bandage your palm with at the base of the altar,” she said. Her 
	voice was absent-minded and distant, with not a hint of remorse or regret 
	for wounding her student.<br>
	<br>
	Shocked, Brizinna sought out the linen strips as directed, and wound them 
	around her palm until she had bandaged it securely. She couldn’t keep the 
	sense of betrayal out of her face as she sought her teacher’s eyes.<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira was staring into the bloodied water with an expectant grin, when 
	she finally thought to look at Brizinna again. Her lip curled with contempt 
	when she saw Brizinna’s hurt expression.<br>
	<br>
	“Did you think blood magic just meant other people’s blood, young girl? You 
	have much to learn about the Radiant Blood if you thought the path to 
	mastery would require no sacrifices of your own.”<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira looked down into the swirling blood and water and grinned 
	triumphantly. Brizinna looked into the bowl and watched with horrified 
	fascination as the blood seemed to drain out of the bowl and the 
	crystal-clear water started to cloud over, turning opaque, and then starting 
	to display an image…<br>
	<br>
	“Some of the Old Ones have grown finicky, and prefer the taste of blood 
	unwillingly given,” Nuhmudira said in a conversational tone. “Perhaps they 
	have tasted my own blood too often, and would not give me the power I needed 
	to defeat that old fool’s warding until they got a taste of your fear and 
	pain. Or perhaps they simply wanted the taste of a younger, fresher life.” 
	She almost seemed to leer at her student.<br>
	<br>
	Brizinna shuddered, but could not look away from the image taking shape in 
	the bowl. It resolved itself into something recognizable… something that 
	looked like a skeletal corpse in a grey robe, reclining on a throne carved 
	from stone. At first she thought Nuhmudira was scrying another crypt to loot 
	for Empyrean artifacts. But then the corpse moved, and seemed to stare 
	directly at her. There was a malevolent light in the skull-face’s eye 
	sockets, and she knew she was face to face with one of the great undead 
	lords of Dereth.<br>
	<br>
	She heard Nuhmudira’s throaty laughter from across the altar. “I have you 
	now, my lord of bones.”</font></span></p><font face="Arial" size="2">

	<p><span lang="en-us">Greetings and welcome to the June 2008 Release notes! 
	Let’s see what is new and exciting this month in the world of Dereth!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Updated Content and Functionality</b></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us">There are now two summoning stones in the 
		Graveyard. One summons the Jester with the old quests, other summons 
		Jester with new quests. You must complete last month's quest before he 
		will allow you to do this month's.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Jester in the Graveyard will allow you to 
		hand him in a spectral Soul Bound staff for a new one - this is for the 
		players whose staff did not update on last patch like it should have.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Jester at end of the Jester dungeon will now 
		reward players with a jester card for repeat runs along with the Arcane 
		Pyramid.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The Jester in the Graveyard will allow you to 
		turn in a Soul Bound spectral atlatl for a new one with a lower wield

&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">Glenden Wood invasion has been changed to no 
		upper level cap on the dungeons. To allow for this the starting quests

		<li><span lang="en-us">The Soul Fearing Vestibule quest has had some 
		adjustments made to it. The High Acolytes Skull is now on a 13 day 
		pickup timer instead of 5 hours.<br>
&nbsp;</span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us">The XP reward for turning in the Acolytes Skull 
		has been raised on both NPC’s you can turn it in to.<br>

	for Asheron's Call in June. Please remember that along with everything 
	listed here, there are several new quests and exciting things going into the
