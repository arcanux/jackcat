	You start by going to the Obsidian Span, to a little shop at 35.2N/39.3E, 
	and talk to Larinne Kerendova just inside the door. She will give you 4 
	letters you need to deliver to 4 different people in 4 towns.<br>
	<br>
	Renald the Eldest in Holdburg<br>
	Nen Ai just outside Shoushi<br>
	Ma'yad Ibn Ibsar in Yaraq<br>
	Turien Di Furza in Sanamar<br>
	<br>
	Once you have their replies, return to Larinne and hand the 4 answering 
	letters to her. In turn, she will give you a token, which you can then hand 
	to one of the 3 pet vendors. I gave mine to the Ursuin vendor, and received 
	a kennel, which will summon/de-summon my pet.&quot;</font></span></p>

	Maggie -- Another thing 
	on pets, they do not portal with you. No worries, when you portal, they just 
	go back into their box, so when you come out of the portal, just double 
	click and out the come again. Pets don't do much, besides look pretty cool 
	following you around. They don't fight, and they are transparent as far as 
	other monsters are concerned, but I did get mine stuck on a rock! I tried to 
	out run it, no luck, it kept up pretty well. I'd imagine that if you do 
	manage to lose your pet, using it's box will make it pop out again.<span lang="en-us"> 
	One more thing Maggie, it's ok if you out run your pet. I managed to be mine 
	stuck on the side of my villa and then ran off. I had it selected and when I 
	ran away it disappeared, so I used my box, and out it popped again. So no 
	worries if you lose your pet, just use the box and it shows up again!&quot;</span></font></p>

	Known Issue</a>: &quot;There is a known issue with The Zefir, Tusker and Fallen 
	Creature kill tasks this month. Players have reported no matter how many 
	kills they get, the tasks do not complete.<br>
	<br>
	There is also an issue with the Elementals killtask in Stonehold. With all 
	of these tasks, if you complete them you will be able get the reward for

	</b>Thanks to Chris, Yertle of MT, Septa Scarabae!<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Yuan Hanzu tells you, &quot;If you wish to craft a 
	Composite Bow for yourself you can find my book on the process at most Ivory 
	Crafters.&quot;<br>
	Yuan Hanzu tells you, &quot;If you are looking to upgrade your bow or simply wish 
	to help me collect some materials for my craft I have a small task for you.&quot;<br>
	Yuan Hanzu tells you, &quot;I've heard of a chain of Ancient Caves where an 
	unknown creature's bones may be found. These bones make exceptional handles 
	for the Composite Bow and Composite Crossbow. Unfortunately the caves are 
	infested with Grievvers and can be quite dangerous for an unprepared 
	explorer. Go and find a Fossilized Bone in the caves deepest depths. There 
	are other bones on the upper levels of the cave that I can use as well.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Yertle of MT reports: 
	&quot;Retrieved Fossilized Bone which is in Deepest Caves (contains Parasitic and 
	Bile Grievvers) which is entered from Ancient Caves at 46.1S 87.2W outside 
	AB near Pookie (good for quick recall/tie to Pookie as well). Gave 
	Fossilized Bone to NPC by the Bowyer in AB and he returned an Exquisite Bow 
	Handle which I then attached to a Composite Bow with a Bow Skill of 466 
	(don't actually know if a check is involved). Picked up 2 other bone types 
	in the Ancient Caves, one from Ancient Caves then one from Deep Caves portal 
	in there. I think I used the best available handle (other two were in less 
	dangerous monster dungeons). Appears you can turn in bones for handles and 
	then handles for XP as well (not sure how much but think 13 day timers on 
	bone pick-ups. Thanks!&quot;</font></span></p>
