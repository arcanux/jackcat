	<p>
    Ardry staggered into the study, bent under the weight of a bulging pack. He 
	set the pack down on a desk already overflowing with notes and papers, and 
	the pack settled with an audible series of clanks.<br>
	<br>
	At the other end of the room, the renowned sage Aliester the Loquacious 
	peered at his nephew over the steaming rim of an alchemical crucible. His 
	eyes drifted to Ardry's pack.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Great Geraine's ghost, Ardry! Are those stag antlers poking out of your 
	pack? I haven't seen a stag in Dereth in all the years I've been here. In 
	fact, the lack of ruminant ungulates in Derethian fauna is the subject of a 
	treatise I have been working on...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry held up a hand to stop him before he could go on any longer about 
	another of his favorite esoteric subjects. &quot;Not a real stag, Uncle. Just 
	some clever heraldry on a new helmet, you see...&quot; He opened the pack and 
	lifted out a beautiful silver helm, fashioned in the shape of a stag's head.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ahhh, I recognize that now. Yes, the famous Stag of Bellenesse. Did you 
	know, among all of the great houses of Viamont, the heraldic animals are 
	actually a hold-over from the days when the savage Viamontian tribes 
	worshipped totem animals, and thought to draw their strength from their 
	tribal animal? There was one tribe called the Tullio, who controlled a fort 
	at the center of a river network and took the trout as their symbol. Suffice 
	it to say that the choice of a, ahem, well, floppy food item led to a 
	disastrous...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry interrupted his uncle again. &quot;I'm sorry, Uncle, but I haven't really 
	got time for another lecture. I've brought these here for your analysis, as 
	I was asked. But I must get going soon. I just have to gather a few supplies 
	and head right back out, because there are reports of some of those strange 
	creatures from last year's Festivus season re-appearing, and in more towns 
	than just the one we had last year.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ardry started rummaging through his desk's drawers, picking up and 
	inspecting everything he found. He quickly tossed a few of the objects into 
	another pack, much less full than the one he'd dropped on top of the desk.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Do tell? I shall be most curious to read your report about these latest 
	occult disturbances.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Some day, Uncle, I'd like you to put your mind to work trying to figure out 
	why such strange things happen every year at this time. Is there some 
	compelling reason for spirits or the undead to feel particularly restless in 
	the fall?&quot; Ardry tried to keep the sarcastic tone out of his voice. It 
	didn't really matter – his uncle Aliester was famously oblivious of irony or 
	sarcasm if there was any chance he'd get to talk about some interesting 
	research topic.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well, as to that, Ardry, I have put together some preliminary observations 
	in the hopes of formulating a thesis for evaluation with the other sages. 
	You see, I think it has something to do with the onset of the coming winter, 
	and a reminder of the turn of the seasons, what some tribes of the Falatacot 
	called the Wheel of All Things and the Milantans on Ispar commemorate with a 
	Festival of the Dead, in fact, particularly disturbs the sensibilities of 
	creatures so tragically and irrevocably frozen in necromantic stasis...&quot; <br>
	<br>
	As he built rhetorical momentum on this topic, Aliester started 
	absent-mindedly toying with the very objects Ardry was trying to sort 
	through. Ardry tried to tolerate the disruption, but his frustration got the 
	better of him when he looked for an item a second time, discovered it was 
	missing, and realized one maddening moment later that his uncle was playing 
	idly with it.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Uncle!&quot; In desperation for some way to distract the meddlesome sage and 
	shoo him away, he looked around the room, and saw the crucible on his 
	uncle's desk. &quot;What have you been working on?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ahhh, I am glad you asked, Ardry!&quot; The easily distracted sage shuffled 
	excitedly back to his desk and started picking over the items there. &quot;It 
	turns out that some of the more powerful alchemical preparations we have 
	been trying to perfect for some time were actually deceptively simple. The 
	solution, hah, no pun intended, was right under our noses the whole time. 
	You'd have thought that initial research would have led us to look at it, 
	but I suppose it is easy to overlook the simplest and humblest 
	ingredients...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Aliester stopped and looked around. It looked like he was alone in the room.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Ardry? Did you go to the bathroom, my boy?&quot; There was no answer. The 
	drawers of the desk were closed again. The second pack was gone. Ardry had 
	evidently gotten everything he needed from his desk and left the room before 
	he could finish detailing his alchemical experiments. &quot;Ah, well. I'll 
	prepare a full report for him when he returns. He'll enjoy that, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	He looked down at the stag helm and the pack full of other items that Ardry 
	had dropped off. &quot;Well, I may as well take a look at all the wonderful 
	things he's brought me. I do love this time of year.&quot;</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">In the warm, smoky confines of the Shining Shield 
	tavern of Hebian-To, two men shared a plate of pickled eggs and a pot of 
	green tea at a second-floor table. They were masked, much like the revelers 
	who filled the tavern's first floor, but their masks were simple strips of 
	black cloth that covered the upper halves of their faces, not the elaborate 
	and garish monster masks favored at this time of year.<br>
	<br>
	The larger of the two men sipped thoughtfully at his tea as his green eyes 
	flicked over the crowd, wary for danger even now, in the middle of one of 
	the most festive occasions celebrated in Dereth. His companion, smaller and 
	younger, was more openly vigilant, to the point of appearing restless. He 
	seemed particularly intent on staring at the door of the tavern and 
	inspecting every person who came in or out.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Calm yourself, Adso,&quot; the older man said. &quot;Anyone casing this tavern would 
	pick up on your nervousness immediately.&quot; He picked up a pickled egg from 
	the plate and popped it into his mouth, chewing precisely and thoroughly 
	without any evidence of actual enjoyment on his thin lips.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I'm only nervous about Sabithra's foray into the crowd, Master,&quot; Adso 
	responded. He seemed on the verge of getting up out of his chair. A simple 
	gesture of Master's left hand seemed to center him and keep him from getting 
	up, but he remained agitated. &quot;What time is it, anyway?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;It's almost midnight, Adso. A very wise man once told me that all things 
	are possible after midnight. Keep that in mind.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso sat back, thought that one over for a moment, and looked at his Master 
	with a confused and vaguely irritated expression that was easy to see even 
	past his mask. &quot;With all due respect, Master, what is that supposed to 
	mean?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The Master smiled enigmatically and said only, &quot;You'll see.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The words had just left his lips when there was a high-pitched whistling and 
	crackling noise outside. The patrons of the tavern rushed outside. Through 
	the open door, Adso saw flickering purple light. People were cheering and 
	dancing. Over the mysterious noise and the cheering, Adso thought he could 
	hear people shouting, &quot;Happy Anniversary!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What is going on out there?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You haven't been here long enough to have seen one of these for yourself, 
	Adso, but maybe your duties have also kept you too isolated from the rest of 
	your fellows here on Dereth. They are celebrating another milestone in our 
	people's tenuous foothold on this world.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Are they celebrating the defeat of Grael? The truce in the war with Varicci?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;All of that, and more. They are celebrating what it means to be a Derethian, 
	alive in a world that is certainly intent on devouring them. It will do you 
	some good to learn more about your fellows. I feel like perhaps I pulled you 
	too soon from your fellow new arrivals, before you got a chance to 
	experience the things which give us all a common bond here. Ah, but Sabithra 
	has returned.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Adso whirled. Sabithra, masked like they were, stood behind their table at a 
	rigid posture of attention. In his agitation, he had not noticed her coming 
	in, nor noticed her progress as she snuck up behind them. Apparently their 
	Master had, which was why, Adso reminded himself, he was the Master still.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Did you get what I asked you to get, Sabithra?&quot; Master asked calmly.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I did, Master. The attendant didn't want to give me three. She said I would 
	have to wait to get more than one. But I&amp;&quot; she paused, before smiling 
	proudly. &quot;I stole two more.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Well done, Sabithra. Give one to me, one to Elder Brother Adso, and keep 
	one for yourself.&quot; He got up, left some pyreals on the table, and gestured 
	to his two apprentices.<br>
	<br>
	Adso inspected the slip of paper that Sabithra gave him. It was marked with 
	a stylized N and C. He didn't get to read the inscription on it, because his 
	companions were moving briskly down the stairs and he had to catch up.<br>
	<br>
	Master led them through the celebrating crowd. There were fireworks shooting 
	into the sky, coming from the bronze statue of Ben Ten near the center of 
	town. Adso gaped unprofessionally at the sight, allowing himself to be 
	pulled along in his Master's wake until they stood before a smiling Aluvian 
	woman in extravagant white robes.<br>
	<br>
	At Master's direction, they turned over their scraps of paper to the woman. 
	Adso was still too confused by the noise and the show in the sky to pay much 
	attention to what was going on, and was only dimly aware of her instructions 
	to &quot;hold on to your socks&quot; – but the wrenching tug of portalspace brought 
	him back to himself.<br>
	<br>
	After a few moments, he, Master, and Sabithra stood in a darkened corridor 
	in a place that Adso did not recognize. There was the faint sound of some 
	frenetic, pulsing music, unlike anything he had ever heard before.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What is that noise?&quot; Adso asked.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Nostalgia,&quot; their Master said, with a strangely wistful tone in his voice.</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Hello there and welcome to the October 2006 Letter to 
	the Players!<br>
	<br>
	It is once again festival time in Dereth! The time of year when the chill of 
	the fall season begins to nip at the air, and at your toes! With the coming 
	of the Festival celebration comes new masks and guises as well some fun 
	surprises. <br>
	<br>
	Let's see what is new this month in Asheron's Call!<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Content and Updated Functionality</b><br>
	This year the October event brings us to the seventh anniversary of our time 
	together in Asheron's Call. With that comes some grand celebrations among 
	the people of Dereth. There will be fireworks, sparklers, and maybe even 
	some disco dancing! Not to mention the many tricks and treats that will be 
	available. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank you, the 
	players of Asheron's Call. Without you we would not be able to continue 
	working on the game that we love so much. So as we approach that day 
	(November 2nd) we just want to say a heartfelt Thank You for your loyalty 
	and support from all of us here on the Asheron's Call team. <br>
	<br>
	The first stages of our proposed improvements to the trade skills will be 
	going in this month. Players who have the Alchemy skill trained will have 
	the ability to create new 7th level protection gems. These gems will be able 
	to be traded or given to any player and can be used by any player to cast 
	the various Life Magic protection spells on themselves. <br>
	<br>
	The Scarecrows have once again begun appearing on the landscape throughout 
	Dereth. Be sure to keep an eye out for them when you are out hunting. <br>
	<br>
	In keeping with our theme of revising some areas of the game for better 
	hunting we have added some new tasks to continue the improvements in the 
	area known as the Valley of Ruin. <br>
	<br>
	When the October event goes live newly acquired white rabbit slippers should 
	now appear white instead of the off white that appeared after the launch of 
	ToD. This only applies to newly created slippers and not previously crafted 
	slippers. <br>
	<br>
	<b>In Concept</b><br>
	These are game changes that we are thinking about for upcoming events. We 
	cannot guarantee when or even if these changes will be added to the game, as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items we will be adding to the game. With each 
	monthly event we will be discussing an in concept topic, in order to give 
	you as much information about the item that we can.<br>
	<br>
	As part of our effort to continue improving the overall experience here in 
	Asheron's Call we are going to be working on some Housing Economy 
	Improvements over the next several months. The goal of these improvements is 
	to make all forms of housing more useful to players, as well as making the 
	concept of owning housing less of a chore and more of a bonus, while still 
	making sure that there is a cost associated with owning the various levels 
	of housing. <br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	October and beyond. Please remember that along with everything listed here, 
	there are several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the 
	October event.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you for playing Asheron's Call and we look forward to seeing you all 
	in Dereth.</span></p>
