	<p align="left">Queen Elysa entered the royal Map Room to find a man in 
	well-worn chain and leather armor standing by the table. He was old enough 
	to be Elysa's own father, but he had the spare, leanly muscled build of a 
	veteran who has survived innumerable battles. With his fearsome scars and an 
	intense yet distant gaze, the soldier was a discomfiting presence.<br>
	<br>
	As soon as she entered the room, the old man snapped to attention and bowed 
	at a precisely correct angle. She nodded in response and sat at the head of 
	the table. He took his signal to sit, and waited politely for her to speak 
	first.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Forgive my late arrival, Captain Tharnoch. I was delayed by another 
	argument with the young Prince.&quot; She smiled as graciously as she could.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;That is frankly none of my business, Your Majesty,&quot; Tharnoch said, after a 
	slight pause.<br>
	<br>
	Elysa blinked, momentarily confused at the captain's stiffly correct rebuke. 
	Then she recovered her composure and decided to get to business. &quot;Captain, I 
	have read a very brief report on the circumstances that led you from the 
	Bellenesse lands on Ispar to the wilds outside of Silyun here, but I would 
	like to speak in further detail about your experiences.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As you wish, Your Majesty,&quot; he said.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So let us start from the beginning. Please tell me what you and your 
	soldiers were doing so deep in Viamontian territory.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;We had received information hinting at the rift between the House of 
	Bellenesse and the royal house. I was given broad freedom in my command, and 
	I figured that properly planned and targeted attacks on the borders between 
	Bellenesse lands and loyalist houses would create the appearance of 
	rebellion, forcing the Viamontians to bring at least some of their army home 
	to deal with the problem.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So you were, essentially, creating an appearance of civil war in order to 
	start a civil war.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	For the first time since she had met him, Captain Tharnoch smiled. &quot;Yes, 
	Your Majesty. I thought it was very poetic that we were killing Viamontians 
	to make Viamontians kill each other.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Elysa nodded. &quot;I see. And then... Prince Renlen's murder... We heard reports 
	of all that from new arrivals...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Yes, Your Majesty. Bellenesse was already planning his own insurrection, 
	and his daughter's murder of the younger Prince at that tournament provoked 
	a true civil war. In a sense, Duke Bellenesse unknowingly accomplished our 
	goals.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So how did you come to Dereth?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;The royal armies were recalled from Aluvia and Gharu'n, and swept through 
	the Bellenesse lands. We did our part to bleed them as they went, but we 
	were slowly driven toward the Duke's castle, hiding from both sides. We 
	finally went to ground in an abandoned farmhouse near the castle, with the 
	royal armies closing the circle around Bellenesse. We were preparing to, ah, 
	sell our lives dearly in a last stand, Your Majesty, when a portal appeared 
	in the barn.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;A portal that led you to the Halaetan Islands, along with all the 
	Viamontians.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;That is correct, Your Majesty.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;So how did you survive all those years in isolation, without a way off the 
	islands?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;My soldiers were all highly trained for just that sort of situation, Your 
	Majesty. I will not pretend that it was easy. Prince – er, excuse me, King 
	Varicci's forces infested the islands. I had seen many terrible things in 
	war before, but what we encountered in those long years in the 
	wilderness...&quot; He paused and met the Queen's eyes for just a second. In that 
	moment of contact, Elysa somehow got a keen understanding of the kind of 
	horrors that Tharnoch had been through, isolated in an unknown world, 
	hounded across wild and desolate islands by Varicci's monstrous forces.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Captain, I must tell you that all of the veterans of Isparian wars who 
	served with you have only the highest praise for your dedication, courage, 
	and skill. You bring with you a formidable reputation. And still I find 
	myself amazed that you managed to survive that long, especially without 
	lifestone protection...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;As I said, Your Majesty, it was... very difficult. I lost half of the 
	soldiers under my command. Brave and loyal Aluvians, every man and woman of 
	them. All of us still alive were... changed by what we went through. But we 
	did manage to survive, get off those islands, and finally make contact with 
	your people. As for the lifestones...&quot; The captain's gaze wandered, and he 
	shivered. &quot;I still have trouble accepting that such things could be 
	possible.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Elysa nodded knowingly. &quot;In a just world, Captain, I would be able to offer 
	you honors, titles, a grant of rich land, and a comfortable retirement to 
	reward you for your service. But in this strange world, I am afraid I can 
	only offer you more of the same: war against Varicci. You and your soldiers 
	have so much knowledge and expertise, I am afraid we are going to have to 
	press you into service with little rest. We have another unorthodox war to 
	fight.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch's eyes gleamed. &quot;Your Majesty, I was born in Morain Province, right 
	on the border with Viamont. I have lived almost my entire life fighting 
	Viamontians, in the open or from the shadows, whether the local lord held 
	allegiance to their crown or to ours. All I ask is to be able help carry the 
	fight to this rabid dog who calls himself a King, and the opportunity to 
	meet the end of my days with Viamontian blood on my blade.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Your end of days may not come for a long, long time here because of the 
	lifestones, Captain. Though there are exceptions...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Tharnoch nodded solemnly. &quot;I have heard tell of the death of one named 
	Antius Blackmoor, Your Majesty. From what I have heard, it was a noble 
	sacrifice. It was a good death.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	She took some time to contain her emotions and said, &quot;Antius was a great 
	man, and he will be sorely missed. He provided good counsel, he was a 
	courageous leader, and not least, he was instructing my son, the Prince 
	Borelean, in the arts of war and diplomacy.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I am no diplomat, Your Majesty, but there are several soldiers from my 
	command who can educate the Prince in the ways of combat. And in subtler 
	ways of fighting, as well. Ways that he might not have been able learn from 
	a gentleman.&quot; The captain allowed himself another smile. &quot;Yes, given what I 
	have learned about the nature of the war you have on your hands, I think we 
	can help you. I pledge myself and my soldiers to your service, my Queen.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;We have much to discuss then, Captain.&quot; Elysa looked for a long time across 
	the table at the captain. This conversation had given her a clear sense of 
	the rage that roiled beneath his courtesy and discipline. Not too long ago, 
	the edge of madness that she sensed in him would have worried her. Now, she 
	felt more hopeful than she had felt in a long time, just to have this proud, 
	half-crazed old warrior on her side.</p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">The old Viamontian woman shuffled across the room, 
	cradling a bottle of wine in her hands. She brought the wine to the table 
	and presented it to her guest, a younger Gharu'ndim woman dressed in blue 
	Amuli armor. The younger woman inspected the label and sighed 
	appreciatively.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I never expected to see another bottle of Bonniduenne in my life,&quot; she 
	murmured. &quot;The grace of the Poet be upon you, Grand Mother.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The older woman laughed as she poured out two glasses. &quot;Please, Hashina, you 
	may call me Elgenia. And it is my pleasure to share one of my last bottles 
	with you. I will also give you a bottle to bring back to your gracious 
	Queen. I know that the grapes in this land are an inferior vintage to what 
	we had in Ispar.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Hashina accepted a glass and raised it in toast. &quot;To the success of our 
	shared ventures, both public and private,&quot; she said.<br>
	<br>
	Elgenia, the Grand Mother of Silyun, clinked her glass against Hashina's. &quot;A 
	worthy toast,&quot; she said, and took a long sip. &quot;Though, speaking of sharing, 
	there is one matter I wished to discuss with you...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Hashina arched an eyebrow. &quot;I must warn you that I am not empowered to 
	discuss any other terms beyond those which we have already ratified, and 
	the... informal cooperation agreement.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Elgenia nodded amiably. &quot;As I expected. Call it a suggestion, to bring up 
	with your Queen when you speak with her again.&quot; Hashina nodded, and she went 
	on. &quot;I think that the name of this realm we will forge together should be 
	changed. I do not think a name like 'New Aluvia' is suitably inclusive of 
	all Her Majesty's subjects, even before my people arrived here. It is, 
	perhaps, best suited to region of riverlands and mountains that the Aluvians 
	themselves claim in Dereth, but not to name the realm as a whole.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Hashina considered that. &quot;Personally, I agree with you. We just never 
	bothered much about names before. After our three nations escaped from the 
	Olthoi enslavement, we were too busy with matters of survival to give it 
	much thought. And those of us of Sho and Gharu'n were too happy to find a 
	secure alliance to quibble much about names. Elysa did much to bring us 
	together in the early days. And then there was all the trouble with the 
	Hopeslayer, and then the Virindi...&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I understand how that could be so, and I understand that, if there were no, 
	ah, competing kingdom in Dereth, the name would be moot. But you must 
	understand that my people in particular might not be so enthusiastic to join 
	a realm named after a country with which we have warred for centuries. How 
	would you like, for example, to be sworn to the Kingdom of New Milantos?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I take your point,&quot; Hashina said, grimacing. &quot;Though I hardly think Aluvia 
	and Milantos are comparable nations, I will mention it to the Queen.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Every comparison has its limits,&quot; Elgenia agreed. &quot;But let us move on to 
	other matters,&quot; she said. &quot;I know you are eager to share intelligence on 
	Varicci and the movements of his armies.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Of course, but there are many other things my Queen is curious about. For 
	instance, let us discuss these Fiun creatures and their unique trials...&quot;</span></p>

		<li><span lang="en-us">Some changes have been made to inventory 
		manegement. Here is a summary of these changes.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Picking Up:</b><br>
		- When you pick up an item from an external source, it first tries to 
		merge with a stack in your open pack. If it can't merge with a stack in 
		your open pack, it will try to merge with a stack in your main pack, 
		then try all your other packs one after another. <br>
		<br>
		- If the item cannot merge with any stack anywhere in your contents, it 
		will go into its own slot. It will start by trying to go into the first 
		slot in your open pack (moving everything else down a slot, as normal). 
		If your open pack is full, the item will look for the first pack with an 
		open slot it can use, starting with your main pack and working down. 
		(Note that packs that are being traded, etc., are not valid for putting 
		things into and are skipped during this process.)<br>
		<br>
		- If your entire inventory is full (and the item was unable to merge 
		with any existing stacks), you'll get a message that your inventory is 
		full. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Example:</b> Let's say you have your third pack down open -- your 
		only red pack. The red pack is full, and it contains a stack of 9000 
		pyreal coins. Your main pack is also full and contains no coins, but the 
		second pack down -- the blue one -- has 3 slots open yet and a stack of 
		5000 coins. You are picking up a stack of 1001 coins off a creature 
		corpse. <br>
		<br>
		The coins you pick up try to go into your red pack, but they are too big 
		to merge with the coins that are there already. So they start at the 
		top, in the main pack, looking for a merge. There are no coins in the 
		main pack, so they try the second pack down, the blue one. This pack has 
		a stack they can merge with, so they do. The coins end up in your blue 
		pack, in a stack of (now) 6001 coins. <br>
		If there had been no coins in your blue pack (and no more packs to 
		check), the the coins would have tried to make a new stack in the red 
		pack. Failing that (because there was no space), they would have tried 
		to make a new stack in the main pack. Failing that (again, no space), 
		they would have made a new stack in the blue pack, which had space. <br>
		<br>
		-- The following count as trying to pick something up for the purposes 
		of this behavior: <br>
		-- Using the R key on something external to you that can be picked up.<br>
		-- Using the F key on anything, internal or extermal.<br>
		-- Dragging an icon of an external object onto your 3D representation.
		<br>
		-- Making a shortcut to an object that you do not own but can pick up.

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the January 
	Letter to the Players!<br>
	<br>
	Last month we saw many changes to Dereth. With the passing of Antius 
	Blackmoor, the people of Dereth quickly came to see that war was coming and 
	that the time for action was upon them. This led to the people of Yanshi 
	finishing their rebuilding process to once again become a vibrant town. But 
	the question still remains... what action will the Queen take against King 
	Varicci?<br>
	<br>
	Last month we also unveiled the new timers for the Temples of Forgetfulness 
	and Enlightenment. Although we were very pleased with the design, it appears 
	there may have been some confusion on how the timers work. So in this letter 
	we have decided to clarify how the timers work for those you who were 
	unclear. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Untraining Skills</b><br>
	The first through fourth gems you can pick up instantly. That means you 
	won't have to wait to pick up your first 4 untrain gems. To pick up your 
	fifth through eighth gem you will have to wait one week per gem. On the 
	ninth through the sixteenth gem, you will need to wait 2 weeks per gem. And 
	everything after the 17th gem will require you to wait for 3 weeks per gem.
	<br>
	1st-4th gems: Instant<br>
	5th-8th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	9th-16th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	17th and above: 3 week timer<br>
	<br>
	<b>Specializing Skills</b><br>
	When specializing a skill, the timers differ from the untraining timers.<br>
	The first and second gems you can pick up with no timer. The third and 
	fourth gems you must wait one week each to pick up. The fifth through eighth 
	gems are on a two week timer, which means once you are trying to pick one up 
	you must wait 2 weeks to pick up each gem. For the ninth gem and above you 
	will have to wait 3 weeks per gem. <br>
	1st-2nd gems: Instant<br>
	3rd-4th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	5th-8th gems: 2 week timer<br>
	9th and above: 3 week timer<br>
	<br>
	<b>Attribute Gems</b><br>
	The Attribute gems seem to be the part of the interaction that causes the 
	most confusion. You can pick up your first eighteen gems, either raising or 
	lowering right away. Not eighteen of each but eighteen in total. Then you 
	must wait one week to pick up your nineteenth through thirty-sixth gem. That 
	means for each gem in this span you must wait a week per gem, not pick up 
	another eighteen gems. For the thirty-seventh gem and above, you will need 
	to wait two weeks per gem.<br>
	1st-18th: Instant<br>
	19th-36th gems: 1 week timer<br>
	37th and above: 2 week timer<br>
	<br>
	I hope this helps to clear things up for those confused about how this 
	system works. Now, onto what is happening in the month of January in Dereth! 
	Please keep in mind that this list does not include new quests, or all of 
	the new content going in to the game in January.<br>
	<br>
	<b>New for January</b><br>
	<br>
	<b>Higher Resolution Textures</b><br>
	These textures will be available for use when the event goes live. You will 
	be able to activate them in the same way you would change your graphic 
	settings normally. Simply go to your options tab and scroll down till you 
	see the Texture Detail dropdown. In the dropdown, there is now a Very High 
	setting. If you have ToD, you can enable these textures. Please note that in 
	order for the textures to be seen, you must restart your client after making 
	the changes. Everyone who meets the recommended hardware requirements listed 
	on the box should be able to run these textures with a minimal difference to 
	performance.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Friends Panel</b><br>
	New to Asheron's Call this month is an interactive Friends Panel. With this 
	panel it will be easier to add and remove friends. You will also have the 
	ability to hide your online status. We were unable to transfer your old 
	friends list over to the new Friends Panel. You can however, enter the 
	command @friends old and you will get a listing of your old friends list in 
	your main chat window. In addition, your friends list can now hold up to 50 
	people. <br>
	<br>
	<b>PK Arenas</b><br>
	After getting some feedback from players, we have decided to add in PK and 
	PK Lite Arenas. These arenas will be easily recalled to by either typing in 
	@pkarena if you are a normal player-killer or @pklarena if you are 
	player-killer lite. You will need to be in the state of being PK or PKL, 
	respectively, in order to enter these arenas. For example, if you want to 
	recall to the PK arena, you will need to be PK to do so. These recalls cost 
	the player no mana. In future months, we will solicit feedback from our 
	playerbase on how the arenas can be made better. The goals of these arenas 
	are to not only give player-killers a place of their own to fight in and to 
	also help get the combat out of the marketplace. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Billing Improvements</b><br>
	As most of you already know there was an extended downtime earlier this 
	week. Part of what was being updated was the billing system. As a result of 
	this update, you will now no longer need to contact our billing department 
	in order to re-subscribe your account. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Darktide Server Crashes</b><br>
	Over the past several months there have been multiple instances where 
	sub-servers on Darktide have crashed. We have tracked down the cause of this 
	issue and resolved it. We will have more details on this in the coming 
	weeks. <br>
	<br>
	These are just some of the changes that will be taking place in the January 
	Event, Reprisals. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>In-Concept<br>
	</b>These are some of the game changes we are thinking about for the 
	upcoming months in Asheron's Call. We cannot guarantee when- or even if - 
	any of these changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and priorities 
	can change. These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and 
	items we'll be introducing in each monthly event. Your feedback on these 
	topics is particularly valuable.<br>
	<br>
	-Additional Allegiance Improvements<br>
	-Player-vs-Player improvements<br>
	-Additional High Level Hunting Areas<br>
	-Story Driven Loyalty Decisions<br>
	-Rares system changes/Login Rares<br>
	-Title Management Tools<br>
	-Chat Filters for Global Channels<br>
	<br>
	The items that are included in this section are just some of the things we 
	are looking at for future changes. As time goes on this list will continue 
	to change and expand. As always, all in-concept ideas are subject to change 
	with scheduling and priority changes.<br>
