	the Bur quests.<br>
	<br>
	It started with the Prince spawning some critters, then summoning all 3 ped<span lang="en-us">e</span>stals. 
	Once we defended him while he arranged everything<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
	he opened up Bur. There were 4 chests spawned with the xp item/hookable item 
	in it. We then went through found lots of mushrooms, <span lang="en-us">B</span>uruk, 
	and some Burun NPCs. There are several slayer quests to kill buruk, 4-5 of 
	them or so. Also 4 new Decorative statues of the buruk weapons.<br>
	<br>
	After talking to all the burun NPCs<span lang="en-us">,</span> I went into 
	the Southern Catacombs, then ran around for a little bit and finally found 
	the Deep Caverns portal. There is where I found the Matriarch undead/falatacot 
	at the bottom. She had 9000 hp, and had lots of friends. After killing her 
	then taking the two items back up to the main burun, he gave me a title for 
	one, then sent me to <span lang="en-us">the </span>Hebian-To translator for 
	the other. After translating it, I went back to him again for a second 
	title, Seeker of Torgluuk.<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Adam Swish of TD sends this report: &quot;I played 4 years 
	ago, if you remember, but I got some pictures of really early cottage 
	settlements for you before anyone could buy them. I'm level 40 right now, 
	and reading a little about last night's live event, I knew I had to be 
	careful. I met at my monarch's mansion, Wandering Stranger, and we cast a 
	portal (New Colier Holtburg Settlement Portal), ran about 8 clicks, and were 
	there right when it started, if a little bit late... we got lost =).</span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">The lag was the worst I've ever had in AC. I think it 
	was because when baddies summoned, they came about 2 dozen at a time. I 
	perched up on one of the four towers, and enjoyed the show, trying not to 
	get killed. I clicked the prince to watch what he did. He went to each 
	pedestal and prayed. Every time he did this, the 2 dozen creatures spawned, 
	the lag got worse, and people cleared the way for him. He basically said he 
	was gonna keep praying no matter what. When he got done with all three, he 
	went onto the platform and left. Great.<br>
	<br>
	When he left, he said stay here, and I'll be back soon, basically. When he 
	left, more creatures spawned including a boss that killed probably a dozen 
	people before a group of players took it down. With this, the portal to bur 
	appeared as well as 4 chests with Prince's Badges of Honor for helping with 
	the live event. You can take them to this guy in Yanshi for Xp based on 
	level or hang it on a hook. I made the mistake of turning it in =/. I 
	couldn't go to bur... didn't do the quest, but people already cleared 
	dungeons and beat bosses to get scrolls. These scrolls have to be translated 
	and then I guess they are turned in for XP? Not 100% sure. The 1 of the 2 
	NPCs at the bur site speaks positively of the prince, which I thought was 
	cool. </span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us">The prince talked to people after the portal spawned. 
	He bowed to me and told me that the portal was gonna stay there for a while, 
	which I thought was cool. (people thought it would disappear) I visited the 
	portal again a few hours after and a few people were planning to clear out a 
	bunch of dungeons. As for anything else on Asheron... I don't know, I think 
	we need to give people more time to check out Bur. Hope this helps Maggie!&quot;</span></p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">

	<p><span lang="en-us">Eyas Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	I was early in Cragstone, and was setting my graphics to minimum (sorry for 
	quality screenies), when I actually saw the prince come running into Crag 
	from beyond the meeting hall. The global hadn't been broadcast yet, guess he 
	wanted to be right on time too ;). He prolly ID-ed me and saw my portal 
	ritualist title, since he thanked me for that, but since I was still busy 
	with my pc, I had no proper answer ;).<br>
	<br>
	After the broadcast, more people gathered in Crag, most people on WE were 
	already at the portal site. The prince cast a portal and asked us to clean 
	the way to the site. Few waves of critters, first towards the drop from the 
	portal, later towards the pedestals. Snakes, spirits and falatacot, just 
	like in the dungeons for the flagging and the preparing of the site.<br>
	<br>
	Lag was incredible. I could not switch weapons and hardly managed to heal. 
	After the praying at each pedestal, he asked us to gather on the platform, 
	and a massive wave, including a baddy which was planning to come for our 
	blood (also a dev I guess, since he responded to some stuff people said 
	too). The prince kept role-playing and responding to people the whole time 
	during the event, except when he said something like &quot;save3&quot; and told us to 
	ignore that ;).<br>
	<br>
	After the portal was summoned, the chests spawned, and the prince stuck 
	around a bit chatting with a lot of people, but staying completely in his 
	role. Unfortunately, I don't have a log, since his early appearance kinda 
	surprised me.<br>
	<br>
	The event itself did not take long, I guess 40 minutes all, but after that 
	we started exploring the world of Bur. It might be a dungeon, but it's huge, 
	with a lot of sub-dungeons. Small non-aggro shrooms run around in there, I 
	guess they are the rabbits of Bur. There is a portal that doesn't look like 
	a portal (something like Kor-Ghura or so), which leads to where the 
	kill-task NPCs are, and the vendors which also sell the decoration weapons.<br>
	<br>
	Several other portals, I ran into Southern, but gave up after having the 
	feeling of running in circles, it's another huge dungeon. Lots of new shroom-type-critters 
	and the Guruk. We gathered with a huge group led by Paloma II, and managed 
	to find the portal to get to Bosh Bosh, which was eventually killed. Got 
	loads of screenies from running around there and the new critters, including 
	the image from the splash-screen in the dungeon, but wont fill up the 
	mailbox ;).<br>
	<br>
	Greetz and keep up the good work,<br>
	Sanddh of WE</span></p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">
