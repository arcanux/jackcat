    From the

    Zone</a></span></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The members of the 
    Arcanum would like to welcome you to Dereth. You must be bewildered by what 
    has happened to you, and we hope that this and other documents will help 
    familiarize you with our new world. We call it “our new world” because--and 
    this may be difficult for you to accept--there is no way for you to return 
    to Ispar. Before your arrival here, you may have heard rumors of mysterious 
    spinning discs and missing people; as you now know, these tales are true. In 
    time, we hope that you will accept your fate and see the many opportunities 
    our new homeland offers. Few people get the chance to make a world, and 
    while we may have lost our old world, together we can make this one just as 
    much ours. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin, you will need to understand a 
    little history about our new world. Over 25 years ago, the first Isparians 
    began arriving on this planet Auberean, and specifically here on the island 
    of Dereth. Those first brave souls met the Olthoi, a horrible race of 
    enormous insect-type creatures. The Isparians were quickly enslaved and 
    forced to tend to the disgusting gruel that the Olthoi feed their grubs. 
    Eventually, a few Isparians escaped and formed a small band of resistance 
    under the leadership of Thorsten Cragstone and Elysa Strathelar. With the 
    help of Asheron, the last of the ancient Empyrean people, Elysa and Thorsten 
    killed the Olthoi Queen, throwing the Olthoi into disarray and freeing the 
    captured Isparian people. But the fighters paid a heavy price, as the Olthoi 
    Queen killed Thorsten moments before Elysa struck the killing blow. In 
    memory of the Isparians' heroic accomplishment, the year in which these 
    events occurred is called PY 0 (Portal Year 0). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That climactic battle took place over 10 
    years ago. A period of relative quiet followed, during which we began to 
    find our place in this new world. Only recently has our calm been 
    interrupted by world-spanning near-catastrophes, events that threatened not 
    only to destroy all that we have built here, but to take our lives. Now, in 
    the face of these challenges, our long-absent Queen Elysa has returned. More 
    than ever, we are determined to make Dereth ours. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now that you know a little about our world, 
    you are welcome to explore these halls so that you may understand this world 
    even more. We recommend that you spend some time familiarizing yourself with 
    the most recent events in our history, those that began in the year PY 10. 
    After this, you may want to find out more about the creatures you will be 
    encountering and review such details of this land's history and people as we 
    have been able to piece together. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>The Fourth Sending of Darkness </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    These events culminated with the release of the dread Hopeslayer, 
    Bael'Zharon. Many were surprised by the turn of events that began with a 
    single snowflake falling. . .</font></p>
