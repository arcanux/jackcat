      <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Why not destroy them all?&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Make him cease to be, open him up,
      discover his secrets. When he is liquid and meat you shall know
      everything. </i>Martine was too tired to quiet the voice of the Virindi in
      his mind, so he let it ramble on while he tried to focus on the question. <i>Sharpness
      hurts meat, </i>the voice continued, <i>it is a point. Meat knows nothing
      about a point, about how lovely a point is. You can make the point sing.
      We can sing together. </i>No, the man still had his uses. There would be
      time enough to deliver the man to his minions. Once Martine had received
      his boon, there would be so much time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Forgive me, lord. I must have
      whispered too softly. I asked, 'Why not destroy them all?' Pardon my
      ignorance, but I don't understand why we didn't start with the one in the
      first settlement.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Holtburg, he would have called it a year
      ago. But Holtburg would not do now. Let the man be stupid. Holtburg was
      building a garrison. How could it be more perfect? Holtburg was building a
      garrison, and there was no need to destroy anything there. Quite the
      contrary.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There is a new plan. A better plan.
      A. . .&quot; <i>slice and slice and slice and slice </i>&quot;We will
      still destroy some of them. Enough to cause fear. And leave a few to let
      them feel hope. Their hope is our friend. It makes them soft. Weak. The
      new plan is much better.&quot; The man, <i>what is his name? </i>Martine
      could not remember his name. He knew it once, what was it? <i>slice and
      slice and slice </i>The man did not speak anymore but he seemed content.
      Good, let him be content, let him be happy. Everyone was weak. Except him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;So we shall do it here? This shall be
      the first?&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine nodded. He was tired. Tired of
      listening to the Virindi. The Virindi no longer listened to him. He had
      asked it to be quiet. He thought he had crushed it a long time ago. . . he
      thought <i>sing and slice sing slice we will all sing and slice.</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My lord? What will we be doing?&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What had he said? Where was he? He looked
      around and caught sight of the tower looming before him, a large pyramid
      of stone illuminated by the flickering torches warding off absolute
      blackness. Hatred of the sight coursed through his blood, snapping his
      neck up as it bloomed in his brain.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In his mind, a small girl danced around his
      feet, singing. His daughter? Aritta? She paled. Her mouth went wide,
      frozen into a rictus. Her eyes were holes brimming with violet light.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>You dare? </i>He jabbed his thoughts
      into the place the Virindi whispered from. A horrible squealing, and it
      fled into the jumbled depths of their shared mind. <i>Yes, go and hide for
      now.</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Silence.&quot; The man bowed. <i>I am
      Martine. </i>&quot;Yes, this will be the first.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Do you need time to prepare, lord? Do
      you not require. . . I know that you. . . that Isparians need focusing
      materials for the spells of great power. I have such a device if. .
      .&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Need?&quot; Martine was too amused to
      be offended. &quot;I have desire. I have hate. That is all I need. It
      begins here.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine raised his hands.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She would not allow them to see tears.
      There had been one time before, after Thorsten. . . and she remembered too
      well the problems that had caused. She was the Queen. She could not forget
      that. Yes, a Queen without a castle, a Queen whose subjects barely knew
      her, many of whom would as soon spit at her feet than declare her their
      sovereign.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She was their Queen nonetheless.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She had not wanted the responsibility. She
      only wanted to raise her son. But she had tried to turn her back on the
      world, and the world had almost taken that son from her. Never again, she
      had sworn. Let her people go through their lives either unaware or
      resentful of their Queen, unaware of her life, unaware of her duties. That
      is why she was there.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But this. . . this was almost too much to
      bear. The grim faces of the Council of Antiquaries around her were almost
      as disheartening as the news they bore. Nuhmudira was the surprising
      exception, a distant and vague cast to her eye. Gods, Elysa thought, if
      Nuhmudira is unhinged by this disaster. . . Elysa felt laughter burbling
      up inside. She stifled it. She wanted to release it if only to release
      some of her tension, but she was not sure she could stop it from turning
      into a scream.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It had happened in the midst of high night.
      Where once had stood eighteen proud and tall Empyrean towers, now only six
      remained. The rest were crumbled and aflame. They had burst from within.
      Without warning or apparent provocation, they had been rent by an instant
      inferno, leaving six towers standing.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She had ordered guard outposts built the
      month before in six locations. Those six locations happened to be the same
      as where the towers were that remained. The Arcanum had been reporting
      portal space disturbances around the Nexus towns for weeks. The lack of
      specifics was maddening, but when Nuhmudira and Celdiseth agreed on an
      issue, even if that issue could be no better described than,
      &quot;something is wrong,&quot; Elysa knew that there was a problem. When
      even Asheron could offer no insight into the nature of the matter, Elysa
      decided to begin construction on only the six. Being a Queen to whom no
      one paid taxes did not place her in a position to spend greatly. And she
      thought she had more time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rithwic. Al-Arqas. Nanto. Every day more
      Isparians portaled in from their homeworld. Yanshi. Lytelthorpe. Samsur.
      And they would appear around the nine Nexus towns. The settlements had
      been built around these points, to welcome and shepherd new arrivals into
      a dangerous world. And in the blink of an eye, twelve of them had been
      taken away. There would be no new visitors to these towns now. Only Yaraq,
      Shoushi, and Holtburg remained. And who could say for how much longer
      those would stay? If the goal of their adversary was to let no new
      Isparian adult portal in to Dereth, if they wanted the entire world
      closed, that could only mean. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While she had been lost in thought, the
      Council had started arguing again. Some were saying that this was the work
      of Martine, others that it was the Hopeslayer come again. The theories had
      been endless. Perhaps the Virindi, no, the Dericost; Nuhmudira started in
      about the Empyrean again, but she did it so half-heartedly that even
      Celdiseth did not raise his voice in scorn. Shoyanen was speaking
      earnestly to Fadsahil, presumably about the deep philosophical motivations
      behind such an attack, but either she was too blind to see Fadsahil's
      growing impatience, or too nervous to care.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>They need you. </i>The voice came,
      gentle and resolute into her mind. She wanted to sleep. She wanted to cry.
      Thorsten should have been here. <i>They need you. </i>Were “they”
      Asheron and Borelean? The Arcanum? The Isparians? <i>Yes. They need you.</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Enough.&quot; A soft word spoken into
      the tumult, but the voices of the Arcanum, muttered and raised alike,
      dimmed to silence. She had not chosen this path freely, but that was no
      excuse not to learn her role well. &quot;I have heard the reports of the
      Arcanum, and what I hear is that we know little. Which is worse than
      knowing nothing. If we knew nothing than at least we would not be
      afraid!&quot; She deliberately let some of her anger leach into her last
      few words. Sometimes it was enough to lead with kindness. Other times. . .
      She turned to each of the twelve of the High Council present, looking into
      their eyes for a few seconds. Only Nuhmudira did not look a touch ashamed,
      but she seemed not to notice Elysa at all. Pwyll take the woman! She could
      not fall apart on them now.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nuhmudira, Celdiseth.&quot; At this
      at least Nuhmudira came to, and looked directly at her Queen. &quot;I task
      the two of you with leading the search for how this happened. How and why.
      There are edifices of stone that lasted for thousands of years, destroyed
      in a heartbeat. We will find who did this. Find them and stop them.
      Kerralon, double the guards at the existing outposts. Report immediately
      to me any further disturbances or news. The rest of you are at Nuhmudira
      and Celdiseth's disposal.&quot; They nodded. She let her silence be their
      dismissal. It was dangerous to pair those two old antagonists together,
      but she needed something to shake Nuhmudira out of her current lethargy.
      Maybe Celdiseth would be the proper catalyst.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She looked around the empty room, wondering
      whether she should check in on Borelean. <i>Let the lad sleep, </i>she
      thought as she turned to go back to her quarters. Aye, sleep would be
      welcome. A smile crossed her face, the first of this long night as she
      anticipated a slumber so needed she doubted she would dream.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asaina al-Arqis, a Scholar of the Arcanum,
      burst into the room, gasping for breath and with hair clumped to her
      sweaty brow. &quot;My Queen, forgive the intrusion. . .&quot; Normally
      Elysa would once again have let Asaina know that such formality was not
      necessary, but she nodded for the girl to continue. <i>What now?</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Asaina related the news, Elysa struggled
      to understand the import of this latest event. It bordered on the
      laughable, but still. . .&quot;Get Jaleh back in here.&quot; As Asaina
      sprinted out, Elysa put thoughts of tears and even sleep far from her
      mind. Her people were under attack. She was the Queen. She began reviewing
      in her mind the lists of supplies requested by the outposts as she waited
      for Jaleh to arrive.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the
      world of <i>Asheron's Call </i>continues to evolve. Last
      month saw great prosperity, with increased housing sales and improved
      fellowships. Yet with the onset of winter, how long can such prosperity

      December 18, 2001</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rumbling over the mountains and pouring
      into the valleys, winter has come once again to Dereth. Snow thickly
      blankets the landscape in a lustrous white gloss, coating the trees,
      fields, and hills. In several towns across Dereth gifts have been left in
      the town centers, spreading cheer to all. Farmers report that their
      harvests have yielded an abundance of carrots, but their sales have
      increased threefold in the past weeks. Though they cannot explain the
      reason behind the rush on carrots they point to the new housing
      communities for more complete answers.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New settlements are crowded with
      homeowners, enjoying the “fruits” of the season. Many struggle to
      complete the snowmen that will stand guard outside their homes, while
      inside others enjoy the comforts of their new slippers and warm mugs of
      cider.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet the storm clouds that gathered on the
      horizon during the month of Leafcull have set High Queen Strathelar into
      action. She has moved to fortify the arrival towns across Dereth in
      reaction to severe portal disturbances. Dispatching her Royal Guard to
      each of the outpost towns she has managed to salvage three from the
      destructive forces of a new enemy. In Holtburg, Shoushi, and Yaraq,
      training academies have been established to welcome and prepare new
      arrivals from Ispar for the trials that will face them in this strange
      world. Bolstered by the presence of her troops and the assistance of the
      newest arrivals, these three towns yet withstand the onslaught of this new
      force.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the enemy begins the first stages of its
      assault, adventurers set forth to meet this newest threat. Thrown weapons
      experts take up arm and shield to face the enemy wherever it may next
      rise, as the Isparians unite at last beneath the banner of High Queen
      Strathelar.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most

    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The bug where entire communities could 
      lose all items in their hooks and storage has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">House owners no longer need to add other 
      characters on their account to their guest list. This is now automatically

    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements 
    and Changes</b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We identified and fixed a bug where 
      players could duplicate their items. We log these types of duplication 
      efforts, and players engaging in them risk all of their accounts being 
      banned from Asheron's Call. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was an exploit through which players 
      could fire off a wand's spell many times per second. This was initially 
      fixed in a Darktide-only hotfix, and later hotfixed on all the worlds.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players can now use thrown weapons while 
      wearing a shield. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players with the Thrown Weapons skill now

      have been added to the world. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously, when a house was abandoned, 
      all items in the house on hooks and in storage were deleted. These items 
      now stay in hooks and storage and are accessible to the next owner. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The journal for the Palenqual Totem quest 
      had erroneous text in it meant for the Aun Tanua quest. That text is now 
      given out as part of the Aun Tanua quest. The intended Palenqual quest 
      text, which had not previously been in the game, is now properly listed in 
      Shimauri's Instructions. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug where fellowships did not 
      correctly display the fellowship xp split from the new fellowship changes 
      last month. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Elari Bow has undergone some changes 
      in its spells. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The slide cast range has been increased 
      very slightly to account for situations in which players have only 
      recently stopped moving but still receive “Your movement has disrupted 
      your casting” messages. These messages will still rarely occur. </font>

      Fallout of Duping</b> - </span>From the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletterdec3.asp">Zone</a>
      </small>
      </font>
      </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>December 17, 2001</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As most of you know, we discovered a bug that 
    allowed people to duplicate items in the game without crashing the servers. 
    We have been both actively working on a fix and banning those who engage in 
    this activity. To date, we have banned over 200 accounts associated with 
    duping. It is unfortunate that a subsection of the players felt it necessary 
    to continue to duplicate items knowing that all of their accounts would be 
    banned as a result. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The fix to stop duplicating will be in place 
    with tomorrow's monthly update. We apologize that this took longer than 
    normal to implement. It was an extremely tough bug to fix and we wanted to 
    make sure we tested it enough so as to not introduce another bug. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With that said, now comes the question of 
    what to do about the items that were duped. When we looked at this, we had 
    three options: 1) rollback two weeks to ensure the majority of the duped 
    items were gone, 2) look for items we can be sure were duped and delete 
    them, or 3) leave things as they are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each had their pros and cons: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) If we rollback, even by a day, this would 
    punish every player in the game. The majority of our players did not dupe or 
    even come in contact with duping. We felt, due to the amount of time we 
    would roll back, this would be the most unfair option to the entire player 
    base. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Delete those items we knew were duped. 
    This would be nothing more than a small band-aid on the problem. Many people 
    were duping items that got turned in for other things, which meant we could 
    not detect them. This would be more of a punishment to people who may not 
    have known the item they were getting was duped while letting those who did 
    the duping off the hook. Further, not all items that have been duped are 
    necessarily identified as such. While we could remove the majority of the 
    duped items, we could not remove all of them, and we felt that a partial 
    removal of items would merely increase the value of those duped items that 
    remain thereby making the crime more profitable. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) Leave things as they are. This would leave 
    the economy on some worlds skewed considerably from the norm. This also has 
    the effect of “punishing” those players who out of a sense of ethics did not 
    trade or bargain for duped items, and who miss out on the availability of 
    these items as a result. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each choice above has painful consequences. 
    However, we decided the largest majority of our player base benefited from 
    option 3. Additionally, for the last few months we have been discussing the 
    options of resurrecting items such as the original GSA and the Hoary 
    Mattekar Robe. With the advent of <i>Asheron's Call Dark Majesty</i>, and 
    some of the refurbishing of the treasure system which will be taking place 
    soon, we felt that these items could be reintroduced without the deleterious 
    effects on the game economy and balance that they had before. The events of 
    the last two weeks have further solidified this decision for us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In February, expect a return of these items 
    to be available to the general public. We are cognizant of those issues 
    which made us decide to take these items out over a year ago, but we feel 
    that the new implementation of the dynamic treasure system, as well as the 
    nature of our changing game, make it a good decision to bring them back.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will continue to be vigilant about 
    duplicating offenses, and we will continue to ban those accounts that engage 
    in this practice. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>December 18, 2001</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The December event, <i>The First Strike</i>, 
    is now upon us. Before we delve into the content for this month, we'd like 
    to discuss some of the content issues of last month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the biggest and scariest problems in
    <i>AC's </i>history has been the item loss bug affecting house storage and 
    hooks for the last month and a half. We committed our entire <i>AC1 </i>
    coding resources to identifying and eliminating this elusive bug. Finally, 
    after weeks of searching through bug reports and server logs, we were able 
    to generate a consistent reproduction of the bug and its conditions, and 
    soon after fix the problem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our deepest apologies go out to those players 
    who lost items permanently as a result of this bug. We are committed to 
    ensuring a completely secure storage system for those players who own 
    housing, and we expect that this fix, combined with our recent server 
    stabilization changes, will have permanently solved the problem of item loss 
    in housing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you experience a loss of items in your 
    house, please make sure to either contact an in-game admin or send a bug 
    report to
    <a href="http://bugs.zone.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    http://bugs.zone.com</a>. The quicker we get accurate reports of any such 
    situation, the quicker we can respond to fix the problem. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once we had solved the item-loss situation, 
    we were then confronted with a potentially disastrous dupe bug. For the 
    latest information on that situation, please refer to this page
    <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletterdec3.asp">
    here</a>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, focusing on these two issues 
    forced us to make the tough decision to cut some features that we had 
    originally planned in December. The most notable of these cuts were our 
    planned changes to the treasure system. However, we already have more than 
    half of these changes in for January, so expect to see some improvements in 
    this area soon. These changes will truly revolutionize the concept of what 
    high-level treasure means to the <i>Asheron's Call </i>player. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What we do have going in for December is 
    fantastic. First, in addition to a couple of oft requested housing features, 
    such as allowing all characters on an account to recall to an owned house, 
    and not making other characters on an account take up room in the guest list 
    but possess entry privileges automatically, we are also adding an additional 
    300 houses for December. Further, because of the public demand for more 
    housing, we are planning an additional 500 houses each for January and 
    February. By this time, we are discussing alternate forms of housing to 
    ensure that all players who want some kind of domicile may possess one.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before we get to the main theme of the 
    content, a few quick and scattered observations about some of the other 
    content: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Thrown Weapons: It's what's for killin' 
      stuff. (At least, it's a couple of steps in the right direction.) </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Talk to the hand, baby. . . </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The candy canes really do have a deeper 
      connection to the lore and history of the game that shall be revealed 
      anon. We're not lying. Really. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the dynamics that the team has been 
    very excited about is the new content for beginning and low-level 
    characters. While there had been general improvements to the content for 
    low-level players over the last two years, this was the first time that we 
    decided to try and redo the entire experience for the true newbie. The 
    experience is now a lot more streamlined and “game-like.” We realize that 
    these changes won't appeal to everyone, but we hope you take a look and 
    create a new character to go through it and let us know what you think.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also realize this focus on the newbie 
    experience of the game has left a void in some of the higher level content. 
    After December, we will be focusing on two main tasks: First, our next story 
    arc. Some of you have commented on the difference in teasers over these past 
    two months. This change has been intentional, and it reflects our commitment 
    to this new story arc and the depth and breadth that this story represents. 
    We wanted to make sure that <i>all </i>of our players have the opportunity 
    to follow the basic story, and so we will continue to use these teasers as 
    story bridges for the events. We think the events and content planned for 
    this story arc will represent some of the best work that the <i>AC </i>Live 
    Team has done, and we're excited to showcase it for you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hand-in-hand with that story arc, our other 
    big focus will be to continue to revamp and improve upper-level content 
    dynamics. New enemies to hunt, new strategies to employ to defeat them, new 
    weapons, new armor, new spells. . . we want to continue to redefine what 
    playing <i>AC </i>means so that it continues to remain fresh and enjoyable 
    for all our players. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have experienced some bumps on the road 
    this last month. But we remain committed to providing you with the best 
    online role-playing experience that exists today. As always, we're able to 
    continue to create new stories for Dereth because of you, the players. We 
    appreciate your support and feedback and encourage you to let us know what 
    you think of the latest content. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">December 19, 2001</font></b><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Turbine Entertainment Software is pleased to 
    announce the opening of their <i>Asheron's Call Dark Majesty </i>Web site. 
    In conjunction with the December event, Turbine has opened the doors to
    <a href="http://www.acdm.turbinegames.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    acdm.turbinegames.com</a>, a haven for all players of <i>Asheron's Call </i>
    to keep abreast of the latest news, lore, and a complete compendium 
    database. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We wanted to take the time to answer some of 
    the questions that many of our supporters have been asking, and some 
    questions that just need to be answered. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What is Turbine's purpose for this new site? </b>
    </span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    The new site has been designed to be a valuable resource for all players and 
    fans of <i>Asheron's Call</i>. It offers an interactive news page, developer 
    Q&amp;A section, a detailed compendium and much more. Though not all areas of 
    the site are complete we remain dedicated to giving our players a resource 
    for information about the game they love! </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Why has it taken so long for Turbine to open its 
    own AC site? </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    Oddly enough that is a question that we have been asking ourselves. We had 
    wanted to for a very long time. In the end it took a swift kick in the pants 
    from our CEO, Jeff Anderson, assistance from Ken Karl, Chris Lye and others 
    at Microsoft, a private contractor putting in many hours, and a concerted 
    effort of multiple Turbies to reach our end goal. We're pretty pleased with 
    the results. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What are your hopes and plans for the site and its 
    future? </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    Our plan is simple. Make
    <a href="http://www.acdm.turbinegames.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    acdm.turbinegames.com</a> the most informative and entertaining Web site 
    available for <i>Asheron's Call</i>. We have all of the information on the 
    game, so we can provide the most accurate and complete details about 
    everything to do with the game. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our hope is that the site aids players and 
    fans in communicating more completely with us, while providing a complete 
    and accurate compendium, accessible and detailed history, and an informative 
    news section. What we really want is to become a place where players can 
    come and get the information that they want, without giving too much away.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each month you'll see new updates as we 
    expand the site. An Events Calendar that players can use to announce events 
    on each world, a Turbine Store, more compendium releases, and contests and 
    prizes are in the near future. This site will change as our community does, 
    and we want to make that clear. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Will we be seeing a similar site for AC2 in the 
    near future? </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    Maybe. . . </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Who were the Turbies that helped work on the site?
    </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    An undertaking of this proportion is something that cannot be accomplished 
    without assistance from the whole team. Many late nights and extra hours 
    were put in to ensure that we met all of our day-to-day obligations. Each 
    member of Turbine contributed in their own way and they should all be given 
    a round of applause for the efforts that went into this site. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some additional people should be mentioned as 
    well. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brent Stineman: Brent was contracted to help 
    us build the site from the ground up. He's responsible for the unique 
    structure and all of the code that makes the site tick. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Randy Spong: He's the newest Turbie, handling 
    the daunting task of general webmastering right now. He's the poor guy 
    sifting through your questions, compliments, and complaints. Go easy on the 
    guy, he gets enough guff from us. We don't want him getting broken, we kind 
    of like him. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lastly, but certainly not least, we asked 
    Brent to solicit screen shots, stories and artwork without being able to 
    tell anyone why. We received the great stuff you now see on our site and 
    those artists and writers should be thanked as well. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What was up with the job opening for an intern on
    <a href="http://www.acdm.turbinegames.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    www.turbinegames.com</a> ? </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    As you may have figured out, the intern position was announced to find a 
    person to be the site's Webmaster. We received a slew of resumes within the 
    first few hours of the announcement, and looked through each of them before 
    realizing that we really wanted to find someone local. They needed to know 
    something about the game and be willing to, sometime in the future, face 
    down our rabid fans on forums. In the end, the practicality of finding 
    someone that fit well with the Turbine culture, was nearby, and who knew the 
    game and had previous experience won over and we hired Randy Spong. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We're very excited about the opening of
    <a href="http://ww.acdm.turbinegames.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    acdm.turbinegames.com</a> and hope that you take the time to come by and 
    check out what we've got to offer! </font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">THE GATHERING STORM DUE TO ARRIVE<b><br>
    </b>As the holidays arrive, so too does snow upon the shoulders of Dereth. A 
    lovely sight, and one to herald the return of festivities.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Enormous crystalline structures have appeared in towns, though 
    not of malevolent substance but rather sugar and good will.
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Those passing close by report gifts of 
    peppermint appearing on the ground, as well as helpful blessings added to 
    their persons. Of course, gifts even greater than peppermint include the 
    increased sale of houses and warmth of a furry bunny slipper.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Yet, at what price do these gifts come? Surely the world will 
    exact its toll one way or the other. Already, doomsayers warn of snowmen 
    bearing a wicked gleam to their eye, and new arrivals rushed into the depths 
    of unknown dungeons. Yes, wintertime has come to Dereth--and may all 
    Isparians stand ready!</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">THE FIRST STRIKE<br>
    Rumbling over the mountains and pouring into the valleys, winter has come 
    once again to Dereth. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Snow thickly blankets 
    the landscape in a lustrous white gloss, coating the trees, fields, and 
    hills. In several towns across Dereth gifts have been left in the town 
    centers, spreading cheer to all. Farmers report that their harvests have 
    yielded an abundance of carrots, but their sales have increased threefold in 
    the past weeks. Though they cannot explain the reason behind the rush on 
    carrots they point to the new housing communities for more complete answers.</p>
    <p class="Default">New settlements are crowded with homeowners, enjoying the 
    &quot;fruits&quot; of the season. Many struggle to complete the snowmen that will 
    stand guard outside their homes, while inside others enjoy the comforts of 
    their new slippers and warm mugs of cider.</p>
    <p class="Default">Yet the storm clouds that gathered on the horizon during 
    the month of Leafcull have set High Queen Strathelar into action. She has 
    moved to fortify the arrival towns across Dereth in reaction to severe 
    portal disturbances. Dispatching her Royal Guard to each of the outpost 
    towns she has managed to salvage three from the destructive forces of a new 
    enemy. In Holtburg, Shoushi, and Yaraq, training academies have been 
    established to welcome and prepare new arrivals from Ispar for the trials 
    that will face them in this strange world. Bolstered by the presence of her 
    troops and the assistance of the newest arrivals, these three towns yet 
    withstand the onslaught of this new force.</p>
    <p>As the enemy begins the first stages of its assault, adventurers set 
    forth to meet this newest threat. Thrown weapons experts take up arm and 
    shield to face the enemy wherever it may next rise, as the Isparians unite 
    at last beneath the banner of High Queen Strathelar.<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">

    </span>On December 11th, players experienced a different method of signing 
    in to the Zone and <i>Asheron's Call</i>. Starting that day, players needed 
    to sign in using their .NET Passport IDs instead of their previous MSN Zone 
    IDs. Those who do not yet have .NET Passport accounts can register for one
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/97505.asp">right here</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to answer many players' questions, a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/97506.asp">FAQ</a> has been 
    provided. Also, the MSN Zone
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/97507.asp">FAQ</a> has been 
    updated with information on the &quot;Reset Your Claimed Zone Name&quot; function. In 
    addition, members of the Zone took the time to host a developer's chat 
    covering .NET Passport integration. With many questions fielded, the 
    transcript can be read
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/97508.asp">here</a>.</p>

    with Thistledown's Empyrean Guard. With combined forces, the newly formed 
    Empyrean-Guard raised its common monarch, Drexel Fisthand, to the top five 
    monarchs in the game.<br>
