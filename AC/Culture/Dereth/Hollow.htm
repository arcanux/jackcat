      Oct 2, 2000</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">“Time is not on our side! If things continue
      on their current path, we are all doomed!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon looked around the Zaikhal meeting
      hall, nearly bored to tears. They had been ranting on about the dreaded
      Hopeslayer for hours. Who cared about the Hopeslayer anyway? If this
      Bael'Zharon was going to arrive, wouldn't he have gotten here already?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon stood, throwing his hands up in the
      air in disgust. “Why don't you people live a little! Other things are
      out there besides those Shadows and their shiny floating crystals.” The
      chatter in the room stopped almost instantly. Shocked faces regarded
      Gideon incredulously.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I imagine that most of you probably don't 
      know this, but we do have other enemies besides them. Any creature with a 
      weapon or spell can kill you, and I assure you, there are creatures other 
      than Shadows capable of wielding both. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The monsters all over Dereth are getting
      better organized. Little camps of mosswarts have begun appearing on the
      countryside, which means we may start seeing monster fortifications in the
      near future.” </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon shouldered his crossbow and began to
      walk toward the exit portal. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“And in case you've forgotten, it is
      harvest time -- grain and pumpkins are being harvested under the glowing,
      watchful eyes of scarecrows. There is a keg in every town, and a festive
      feel to the air. Speaking of which, I know it has probably been quite a
      while since any of you have seen a member of the opposite sex, but they
      are out there you know. Live a little. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“And it probably wouldn't hurt for you to
      dress a little better, too. I hear they have some new outfits that might
      even make scholars look good.” </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And with that, Gideon exited the meeting
      hall, leaving a stunned silence behind him.<br>

      Zone</a></font></p>
    <p>
    <img alt="Prepare for adventure" src="Hollow/img_daggerknife.jpg" align="left" width="175" height="126"><font face="Arial" size="2">As fall colors arrive in Dereth, so too do 
    other startling changes. Many autumnal additions have been more than welcome 
    -- consider the pumpkin pie, the new dresses, and smiling jack-o-lanterns. &nbsp;
    </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other changes bode far less than well. 
    Scarecrows have been seen in Dereth, yet ones far more lifelike than any 
    farmer has ever managed to construct. These scarecrows, like the snowmen 
    before them, seem to have taken on a life all their own. What's even worse 
    is that the Virindi puppeteers express a certain interest in the craft, and 
    once the Virindi are involved, no season can be celebrated freely. . .
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Continuing with the next of our massive 
    monthly events, the lands of Dereth have changed with the seasonal opening 
    of October's <i>Hollow Victory</i>. After the fall of Arwic and Tufa to the 
    devastating attacks of the Shadow Spires, many a hero rallied to raid the 
    ancient Empyrean storehouses, destroying three more pieces of Bael'Zharon's 
    crystal prison. As if in appreciation, vendors of all remaining towns have 
    begun selling festive steins, for use at celebratory kegs of beer. In 
    addition, and in accordance with an old Isparian holiday, other vendors have 
    begun to craft previously discarded monster heads into truly horrifying 
    masks. Yet even with the loss of two towns, few have succumbed to lengthy 
    mourning. Many have, in fact, put their energies into the resettlement of a 
    previously abandoned town. . . yet resettled in such a way so as not to 
    attract the high-level magic as might have caused the destruction of Arwic. 
    Xarabydun prospers again, promising an oasis for travelers crossing the 
    desert sands, as well as further mystery for those exploring the secrets 
    lying beneath. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still, can it be said that the season is 
    truly joyous? One brave party claimed to have discerned the location of a 
    mosswart hideout needing to be cleansed from the land. And yet, however 
    prepared these adventurers seemed, with their maps and gear and careful 
    provisioning, none have managed as of yet to find their way back to town.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the defeat of the Vestibule crystals, 
    the Shadow Spires continue their mercurial shifting, sinking slowly to the 
    ground. Adding true danger to the rampant speculations, fearsome creatures 
    have been spotted, and certain areas have gained an almost feverish increase 
    in the rate of monsters spawning there. Even the mighty tuskers have begun 
    sporting a new fall look. Heroes are advised to grab a beer, craft a mask -- 
    and prepare for the dangers of Dereth this autumn! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting 
    additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all 
    changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out 
    everything that's been added or changed! Also, some changes provide ways for 
    players to drive our evolving story forward, and thus we won't entirely 
    reveal them here. As usual, though, the town criers, barkeeps, and scribes 
    may know the latest news. Also, the trades of crafting and selling are 
    always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items are not always 
    listed here in their entirety. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b><font size="2">Highlights include: </font></b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tuskers now look fiercer thanks to new art 
      models. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New monsters have been introduced, 
      including scarecrows. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An exciting new underground city has been 
      discovered for those who are level 25 and under. Look for its location on 
      the map in the desert of Southern Osteth near the Yushad Ridge. What lies 
      below this city? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Try carving a jack-o-lantern. They can 
      also be wielded as fun weapons! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are now beautiful dresses available 
      for each heritage group. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New dungeons and quests have been 
      introduced. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fear the white rabbit! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spell components now weigh less. Mages 
      rejoice. Also, a revolution in component craft makes them easier to carry 
      than ever before. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some monsters on the landscape seem to be 
      gathering into little camps. Good hunting has become available to outdoor 
      adventurers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Beer kegs and beer steins can now be found 
      at your local taverns. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are now more ambient sounds for 
      those running across the lands. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Arrow and quarrel shafts have been greatly 
      reduced in weight! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There's more fun food to fit the season.

      Zaikhal librarians have been updated. </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The floating shield in Trothyr's Rest 
      dungeon has been moved closer to the wall. Also added some other 
      decorations to that room to spice it up. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed the use-description of condensed 
      chorizite oil so that players won't think it can be further strengthened.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Switched Lugian hammers to use Axe skill 
      instead of Mace skill. This fix will also affect all Lugian hammers 
      currently in existence. </font></li>

      and ursuin. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Moved the menhirs in the Bethel dungeon

    Zone</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Life has strange rhythms, especially in our 
    new world. I recently took up a new hobby to fill my leisure time between 
    experiments in alchemy and metallurgy. I began dabbling in the field of 
    geomancy: the study of the land's magical energies. Little did I know that 
    my amateur interest would become so central to my research so quickly!”&nbsp;
    </font></p>
    <p><img alt="Of crystals and magic" src="Hollow/img_lifestone.jpg" width="150" height="151"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So begins the latest text by Zarea bint Zia, 
    “<i>The Breaking of the Crystal Core</i>.” The time for geomancy has never 
    been more appropriate, as scholars have proven that the menhir rings indeed 
    act as portals to the recently discovered Vestibule dungeons. And it is only 
    natural, these scholars say, that the mystic forces of Dereth have chosen to 
    appear in the form of crystals, long regarded as magical conduits. While the 
    Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and Shendolain Vestibules truly glimmer, with strange 
    growths of crystals and wisps of phosphorescent gas, their seeming beauty 
    belies the utmost danger. Explorers entering the Vestibules unprepared will 
    find themselves swiftly returned to their respective lifestones. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The adventurers of Dereth should be advised 
    that all three recently launched Vestibule quests are still very much 
    active. But beware! In order to fully access the dungeons, players must be 
    fortunate enough to find those keys dropped upon the death of certain 
    creatures. For the Fenmalain Vestibule, limited to levels 10-25, these keys 
    can be recovered from both Shadows and Shadow Children. For the Caulnalain 
    Vestibule, limited to levels 26-35, Shadow Lieutenants hold the keys. And 
    for players level 36 and higher, keys to the formidable Shendolain Vestibule 
    can only be found among the Grievvers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to reach the dungeons, players must 
    then find the appropriate menhir ring portals, located in the southern and 
    northern mountain ranges, for the Fenmalain and Caulnalain Vestibules 
    respectively, as well as on the Obsidian Plain, for the Shendolain 
    Vestibule. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although separated by level, no one quest 
    should be taken lightly. Soloing is not advised and a coordinated effort by 
    a well-balanced group highly recommended. Once in the Vestibule dungeons, 
    adventuring parties should be prepared to face not only the Soul Crystals 
    themselves, but also deadly arrays of Shadow guards and their undead 
    henchmen. To continue beyond the latter half of the dungeons, players will 
    require their keys -- which means that all adventurers who die beyond this 
    point will require yet another key to return and recover their bodies.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While certain heroes did manage to shatter 
    the original Soul Crystals within each dungeon, duplicates have reformed in 
    their places. The destruction of these weaker, re-grown crystals does not 
    generate news of the same world-spanning import as that of the Soul Crystals 
    . . . yet valuable shards may still be recovered from their wreckage -- rich 
    gems highly sought after by the craftsmen of Uziz. Already, successful 
    adventurers have reported trading the gems for items both rare and wondrous. 
    Shields, uniquely crafted arrows, even spellcasting orbs seem capable of 
    being created, with these powerful crystal shards at hand. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, even without the Vestibule keys, 
    players may wish to test their mettle and explore the upper reaches of these 
    dungeons. Truly, they are not a sight to be missed. Although, it must also 
    be said: <i>To proceed hastily is but to invite quick death!</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(<b>Update</b>) Following the recent launch 
    of November's event, “<i>Should the Stars Fall</i>,” certain aspects of the 
    Vestibules have been made a little friendlier. The keys to the Fenmalain, 
    Caulnalain, and Shendolain Vestibules can now be given away. Also, the final 
    reward items not only weigh less, but are now less likely to be lost upon 
    death. </font></p>

    ALL HALLOWS EVE DRAWS NEAR! NEW ASHERON'S CALL EVENT NOW UNDERWAY<br>
    <br>
    Microsoft today announced that the &quot;Hollow Victory&quot; event is now underway in 
    the dynamic world of Asheron's Call. After the fall of Arwic and Tufa last 
    month, players raided the ancient Empyrean storehouses, destroying three 
    more pieces of the evil Bael'Zharon's crystal prison. The October event 
    promises more excitement, including the discovery of a new city and the 
    mystery that lies beneath it. Jack-o-lanterns can be wielded as weapons, and 
    the legendary white rabbit is now a fearsome threat to those that may cross 
    its path.<br>
    <br>
    Festive dresses, smiling jack-o-lanterns and pumpkin pies abound, as fall 
    descends on Dereth. Although the gaiety of autumn brings joyous celebration, 
    an ominous feeling fills the air. Looming Shadow Spires continue their 
    mercurial shifting this month, sinking deeper into the ground. There are 
    also reports of strange objects appearing in the skies over the isle, with 
    many travelers claiming to have seen castles floating among the clouds. 
    Scarecrows have also begun to appear in Dereth, but with eerie lifelike 
    features never before seen. Still, the people of Dereth work to make the 
    holiday season a joyous one, as vendors in the remaining towns sell festive 
    steins and, in accordance with the old Isparian holiday, craft previously 
    discarded monster heads into truly horrifying masks in keeping with the 
    traditions of the holiday. Heroes are advised to grab a beer, craft a mask 
    -- and prepare for the dangers and delights of Dereth this autumn!<br>
    <br>
    Asheron's Call is a massively multiplayer role-playing game playable 
    exclusively on Zone.com (http://www.zone.com/) that draws together thousands 
    of players within a dynamic, 3-D online world. Players can create truly 
    unique characters by choosing between extensive combinations of visual

      <p>======================<br>
      Attention heaume fans!<br>
      ======================<br>
      <br>
      In the November update, we'll be reverting all existing heaumes back to 
      the way they were before the &quot;Hollow Victory&quot; event. If you prefer the 
      newer, smooth style helms, they will be available as &quot;armets.&quot; And, all 
      newly created heaumes will be modified to look like the included pictures, 
      but will still retain the character of the classic original heaume.</p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">October 18, 2000</font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">nei@turbine&gt; *casts a singular red eye about the 
    room* <br>
    <br>
    +Chaos@AC&gt; Welcome to our Monthly Asheron’s Call Developer's Chat. With us 
    today is one of the Lead Designers, Eri Izawa and Producer, Charles Bandes. 
    A few reminders of the ground rules: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. You must have your question typed out 
      and ready to cut &amp; paste when your turn is up <br>
      2. Limit one question per person will be strictly enforced. <br>
      3. The question *must* appear in the first line you post. If not, you will 
      be moved back to watching. <br>
      4. You may support your question with up to 2 additional lines of text.
      <br>
      5. If the developer needs more information, we will move you back to 
      asking.<br>
      6. Repeat Questions will not get a response other then “Asked and 
      Answered”. Please watch for your question being asked before you. <br>
      7. As always, the Code of Conduct is in full effect during the chat. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">This is all in an effort to keep the chat 
    running more smoothly, make it more informative and give more people a 
    chance to ask questions. With that, I will hand over the floor to Eri for 
    introductions and we will be off to the questions. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; I'm Eri &quot;reijin&quot; Izawa, lead designer for Asheron's Call and 
    general spec shuffler. With me are: Jesse &quot;Nei&quot; Kurlancheek, game designer, 
    scripter, general systems guy. David &quot;Crowley&quot; Javier, game designer, 
    dungeon maker, and dialogue meister. Ken Troop, Martine's tormenter, is with 
    us tonight. Cardell Kerr is the Mask Meister. Sean &quot;artist extraordinaire&quot; 
    Huxter, lead artist, is also with us tonight. Charley producerly-figure, is 
    with us.... And Jason, techno artist with attitude is also with us :) </font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">As usual, I'd like to talk about how we answer 
    questions. To give you an idea of our schedule, we are already hard at work 
    on the November event. We generally cannot give you concrete dates or 
    feature details for anything new that we're not pretty sure is going in. 
    Also, because we have so much planned, new requests on the boards or from 
    here may not be implemented til some time after the suggestion is made. <br>
    <br>
    nei@turbine&gt; if he's got attitude, what do i have? _&lt; <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; A BAD attitude. But I want to assure you that we are listening! 
    And here's one more announcement: We recognize the changes to heaumes 
    significantly altered many characters' appearances 
    through no action of their own, and further that many players found the 
    change to be aggravating. <br>
    <br>
    jason@Turbine&gt; Hey, I'm working on top secret lunch picking technology.. 
    Opps, now I'm gonna have to kill you.. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; In this case, we have decided to go ahead and revert existing 
    heaumes to the way they used to be to rectify the situation. The new &quot;smooth 
    look&quot; helms will still be available as &quot;armets,&quot; and all newly generated 
    heaumes will be upgraded with more detailed artwork. OK, I'm done. Let's get 
    rolling! <br>
    <br>
    <b>LillithsJabber&gt; Question: Could we see new portals to dungeons placed 
    some where more interesting than out in the open? <br>
    <br>
    LillithsJabber&gt; i.e.Some Portals now are in Crypts, I know of one in a 
    statue head, also know of another that is up a flight a stairs in the 
    desert. Although this is not as important as the content inside a dungeon, 
    the portal placement can create the mood(excitement)... <br>
    <br>
    LillithsJabber&gt; for what may lie inside. Could we please see more of this 
    creativity? Perhaps a portal within the trunk of a large tree or one behind 
    a waterfall (is that even possible?) - Shouts out to Nei but not to 
    Devilmouse =P Done. GA. </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We can put portals in more interesting locations. There've 
    been some good ideas bounced around about this. <br>
    <br>
    nei@turbine&gt; i put portals in my pocket to keep them safe. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Having stuff inside a tree would be cool, and that's an 
    idea we've thought of, but it requires more dev time that usually ends up 
    going to other things. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; But yeah, we'd like to do more with &quot;atmosphere&quot; than just 
    plopping stuff down on landscape. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; So your suggestion is noted, thanks. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    <b>Minuo_of_LC&gt; What kind of love is lockpick looking at? Right now lockpick 
    is only a minor convenience. No one needs to spend 6 skill credits to be 
    able to lag through a door. There are no good chests that can be picked. 
    Might you be able to make a switch that ... <br>
    <br>
    Minuo_of_LC&gt; can be picked and opens 10 doors? That way it would take a lot 
    longer to lag through them. <br>
    </b><br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Yes, we are thinking about how lockpicking can be helped....
    <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Lockpick-requiring doors and chests are still part of the 
    solution, but we are interested in interesting suggestions too :) <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Thanks. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Done. <br>
    <br>
    <b>eedmond&gt; Can you make more quest items a bit better? The Fenmalain shield 
    is useless and so is the new crystal bow cause fragment pieces are so hard 
    to get and so valuable nobody wants to waste them on arrows. I Like the new 
    Gharu and Sho Masks. DONE. </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Sure. We'll make quest items &quot;better.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    <b>fathercordell&gt; Q: Will you please &quot;fix&quot; the trade skills so new items 
    merge with similar items in the backpack upon creation? <br>
    <br>
    fathercordell&gt; It can't be that hard to do, it's the exact thing that 
    happens when you pick an item up, surely you must be able to fool the client 
    into thinking it's just picked the item up. I'm developing alchemy related 
    RSI with so much clicking. <br>
    <br>
    fathercordell&gt; And a major shout out to whoever worked on the new 
    underground city. It's gorgeous. Buy them all beer and charge my account. 
    Oh, and my devilmouse wannabe wants cheese on his holtburger, please make an 
    ingame cheeseburger. GA. </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; please give us your account number and expiration date (jk)
    <br>
    <br>
    Charley@Turbine&gt; There actually is a fix to that already <br>
    <br>
    Charley@Turbine&gt; For some reason people don' t know about this, (even some 
    of the folks here) but I use it all the time <br>
    <br>
    nei@turbine&gt; on the upside: in november, alchemists will save 200+ 
    clicks/per 50 infusions made... <br>
    <br>
    nei@turbine&gt; it's not all that great, but it takes the pain out of the first 
    step in the process. <br>
    <br>
    Charley@Turbine&gt; If you select an item, say an arrowhead, and hit the &quot;f&quot; 
    key, it will stack automatically <br>
    <br>
    Charley@Turbine&gt; Not perfect, but it helps a lot. <br>

    have 600+ followers and are rank 5-6. <br>

    <br>
    nei@turbine&gt; if you can maintain a rank 8+ allegiance that means something.
    <br>
    <br>

    they organzied right, they'd hit 10 <br>

    jesse, devilmouse stinks ;) Done ) </b><br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; There are no definite NEW non-combat skills in the pipeline.
    <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; We add non-combat material all the time (e.g., dresses, 
    pumpkins, etc.) <br>

    <b>doh_jhed_con&gt; Q: Can you *permanently* fix the Three Towers Quest in the 
    Dires (the one where the Accolyte opens the portal on its death)? It's 
    almost ALWAYS broken! I've run to the dungeon 5 times since it was put in, 
    and only ONCE was it working... <br>
    <br>
    doh_jhed_con&gt; Every other time, something was broken. In fact just this 
    week, a few of my friends and I were there, all of whom had completed it 
    before, and we couldn't even get into the 2nd tower. We couldn't even 
    complete 2 of the 3 things to get the <br>
    <br>
    doh_jhed_con&gt; dungeon portal open, and all the advocates said &quot;we were told 
    it is NOT broken&quot; even though it clearly was (we'd all done it successfully 
    before, some of us multiple times!). Maybe you'd consider changing it to a 
    regular, dependable portal. <br>
    <br>
    doh_jhed_con&gt; Hail Doh Jheds! Buff the Skulker!! and Down with Sticky!!!!! 
    Done. </b><br>
    <br>
    Charley@Turbine&gt; We are aware of a bug in that quest, but it's a tricky one. 
    It seems that sometimes if players complete the quest out of order it will 
    confuse some of the mechanics. We're working on a fix, but we have no ETA.

    <b>Collosis&gt; Can we get a key map option that allows us to put items in the 
    first container after the backpack or last container selected(like the F key 
    works for the main backpack)? Any empty container can be moved to the first 
    slot after the backpack with ease. <br>

    are inadequate against targets changing their speed or going after a 
    comrade. Even creatures attacking someone ... <br>

    DTrmn8r1&gt; can it at least be looked at? </b><br>

    <b>Kethlas_WIG&gt; Q: Any hope that archers with 250+ bow skill might have a 
    better then even chance of hitting a moving target? Now, archers have a 
    difficult time hitting a target that is manuevering wildly. (eg. monster 
    chassing a buddy, melee pk chassing a buddy). <br>

		Monsters - </b>From the Zone</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="arial">October 27, 2000</font></b></p>Archibald 
	bent to snatch the scrap of paper from the ground. Blown against him amidst 
	a jumbled whirl of leaves, he'd almost missed its notice. 
	<p>“What have you there?” his partner, Cuthbert, asked. </p>
	“A crudely written note. Here--“ he said, handing the paper over. “I admit, 
	your appraisal skill occasionally proves a trifle better than my own. What 
	do you make of it?”
	<p>“A crudely written note, barely legible.” Cuthbert squinted at the 
	scribbled words. “<i>Go to big tree place</i>,” he quoted. “<i>Get 
	swamp-stinkers to follow you, make big wanga on humans</i>! Written in 
	Banderling.” </p>
	In recent days, hints, and captured notes, and even occasional sightings 
	tell of further danger in the lands. Certain creatures of Dereth have begun 
	organizing into camps. 
	<p><img alt="Banderlings" src="Hollow/img_banderling.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="167">Strong 
	breeds of creatures have long been known to bully lesser ones. Consider the 
	reed sharks many Tumeroks train as “guard dogs.” Banderlings, then, may have 
	learned to do the very same. From somewhere in Osteth, reports have come of 
	Mosswarts gathered under the banner of Banderling camp chieftains. &nbsp; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="Virindi" src="Hollow/img_virindipure.jpg" align="left" width="138" height="180">Far more 
	troubling may well be word of similar activities taking place on the 
	Obsidian Plain. There, Virindi Masters are said to be marshalling Hollow 
	Minions, Tusker Guards, and Drudge Raveners into fearsome legions. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="Mosswarts" src="Hollow/img_mosswart.jpg" align="right" width="139" height="162">One must 
	wonder what sinister implications lie behind these reports, of stronger 
	creatures training weaker. To better defend themselves. . . or to better 
	assault humanity? Then, must not these training camps be stopped, at any 
	cost? &nbsp; </p>
&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Those hunters looking for greater numbers of kills -- and resulting high 
	rewards in experience -- would do well to seek out the monster training 
	camps. The six currently in Osteth will surely prove a formidable task for 
	any mid-level party of heroes. The four, far more dangerous camps in the 
	Direlands, however, should not be faced by any but the most veteran of 
	groups. While the dangers of these training camps continue to threaten the 
	land, the work of such hunters is more in need than ever. <i>To refuse the 
	challenge is but to bring risk to all</i>! </p>
	“How worrisome.” Archibald commented on the note. 
	<p>“The suggestion that creatures now organize against us heroes?” </p>
	“That you can read Banderling. Considering the mask you now always wear, I'm 
	beginning to suspect your true heritage.”<br>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>
	</font><font face="Arial"> 
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Young Gregory stepped with 
    great trepidation between the tall rows of his father's fields. With the 
    fall harvest approaching, strange sights had recently plagued the lands of 
    Dereth. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Many, Gregory believed, conjured up by none other than the local 
    heroes themselves. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>A simple farmhand, poor Gregory had been frightened out 
    of his wits the first time a group ran by wearing the heads of horrid 
    creatures for masks. As if mosswarts and drudges weren't terrifying enough, 
    now he had to worry about ordinary folk masquerading as such?<br>
    <br>
    Not the wisest of boys, Gregory worried he'd one day take a mistaken swing 
    at some innocent festival reveler.<br>
    <br>
    This night, he tracked a real monster. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Or so he feared. His father, glancing 
    out the window, claimed to have seen something strange in the corn. Sheer 
    cruelty, Gregory bemoaned. While his father continued to sup, it was the son 
    sent out to investigate -- armed with nothing more than the woodpile axe.<br>
    <br>
    As he walked the rows, Gregory hoped to face nothing worse than a reveler 
    returning to the town's beer keg.<br>
    <br>
    Only... young Gregory didn't find anyone at all. Approaching the field's 
    scarecrow, he loosened his grip on the axe, letting it fall to his side. He 
    didn't remember this particular scarecrow being built, but it did its job, 
    frightening off whoever had entered the field.<br>
    <br>
    Might as well grab a pumpkin while I'm out here, Gregory thought. The local 
    youths had been competing lately to see who could carve the most fearsome 
    face onto one, and Gregory needed the practice. Bending to pick his choice, 
    Gregory failed to notice the smile spread across the scarecrow's face.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Judge from the leaves, from the seasonal beer -- harvest time has come to 
    Dereth! Even the tuskers have updated their coats, perhaps in knowledge of 
    the coming winter months ahead. For now, though, the citizens of Dereth have 
    taken full advantage of the harvest festival, reveling in the masks, the 
    food, the carven jack-o'-lanterns. During the harvest, Dereth's sense of 
    plenty has even extended to the construction -- or resettlement -- of towns. 
    Following the destruction of Arwic and Tufa, pioneers have re-founded the 
    breathtaking underground oasis of Xarabydun.<br>
    <br>
    And yet, if the human citizens revel in the season's prosperity, so too do 
    the other denizens of Dereth. Scouts have returned, reporting new 
    encampments of mosswarts and banderlings near Osteth -- which seem the least 
    suspicious of events these days. For other adventurers swear that they've 
    discovered both a massive Lugian citadel as well as floating cities in the 
    sky. However, when asked about the citadel, no one claims to have yet 
    reached it; and as for the floating cities, the portals to them are said to 
    appear and disappear randomly. There may be truth behind such reports... 
    Then again, these adventurers may simply have gone no farther than the local 
    beer keg.</font></p>

	AC's October event, Hollow Victory, opened on the 10th of the month (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/octrollout.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/octrollout.asp</a>)! 
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>And as promised, great changes have swept across Dereth this fall season, 
    not the least of which being the land's very appearance. A new town has been 
    settled, Xarabydun, under the desert sands of 41.9 S, 16.1 E. Although the 
    town is restricted to level 25 and under (perhaps, some say, so as not to 
    attract the same magic as may have destroyed Arwic), the Guild of Druids has 
    put together a virtual town tour for all to experience:<br>
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guildofdruids.bizland.com/images/xarabydun/XarabydunTour.htm">http://www.guildofdruids.bizland.com/images/xarabydun/XarabydunTour.htm</a>).<br>
    <br>
    As part of the season's festivities, other additions include celebratory 
    kegs of beer, pumpkin foods -- even some new fall fashions! Dresses have 
    finally arrived, with each town's tailor trying their hand at the craft. For 
    an overall look at the many styles available, try browsing:<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.io.com/~jli/tailor/ACdresses.html">
    http://www.io.com/~jli/tailor/ACdresses.html</a>.<br>
    <br>
    While some craft dresses, others look to decorate Dereth itself. Using the 
    fletching skill, all those many pumpkins sprouting across the landscape can 
    be transformed into jack-o'-lanterns most fearsome to behold. But it takes a 
    steady hand... For advice on the craft, Maggie the Jackcat has put together 
    an informative pumpkin carving guide:<br>
    <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Pumpkins.htm">
    http://www.thejackcat.com/AC/Shopping/Crafts/Pumpkins.htm</a>. And don't 
    forget that while some pumpkins make fine lanterns, others make even finer 
    thrown weapons!<br>
    <br>
    Maggie's site also discusses yet another craft item making its appearance 
    this month: masks (<a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Masks.htm">http://www.thejackcat.com/AC/Shopping/Crafts/Masks.htm</a>)! 
    There is more than one face to assume, as the Virindi could surely attest 
    to. From skeletons, to tuskers -- even to ogres, three mask makers have 
    taken up residence in the towns of Eastham, Sawato, and Al-Jalima, able to 
    craft masks depending on one's heritage group. For further information, be 
    sure to also consult the AC Tips guide, located at:<br>

    For a complete technical look at what's been added to the game this month, 
    consult the official Developer's Notes, at:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/octbuild.asp">
    http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/octbuild.asp</a>. In addition, the 
    official lore of Dereth has continued this month with the next story 
    installment from Turbine's Chris L'Etoile: The Brink of the Abyss<br>
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/ASHEabyssII.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall//ASHEabyssII.asp</a>).<br>
    <br>
    Best of luck this October with all the new additions -- and dangers -- to 
    Dereth! While the Virindi have tampered with the scarecrows, and the white 
    rabbit proven more fearsome than ever, adventurers should still remember to 
    breath in the fine autumn air and pause to enjoy the season.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    SECRETS OF THE QUESTS<br>
    While the Menhir Ring quests have been removed from the game, the Vestibule 
    quests are still very much open, active -- and the only way to gain such 
    unique treasure items as crystal shields, bows, crossbows, and orbs! Of 
    course, to fully access the Vestibules, heroes will need the proper keys, 
    courage, and the help of a well-rounded party to succeed. To bring any less 
    is but to invite quick death... For further tips and advice on the Vestibule 
    quests, the official article can be currently found in the news section:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/crystalquest.asp">
    http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/crystalquest.asp</a>. Also look for 
    the arrival of the official article on the monster training camps -- coming 
    soon!<br>

    Thistledown and Raa of Solclaim have become the next to surpass the mark of 
    level 100. Congratulations to our most veteran heroes of Dereth! Other

    MOST RECENT DEV CHAT<br>
    On the evening of Wednesday, October 18th, members of Turbine took time out 
    from their schedules to attend our most recent -- and one of our most 
    populated -- monthly developer's chat. During the course of the evening, the 
    Zone chat lobby max'd out at 1000 visitors attending! Having opened Hollow 
    Victory, Turbine fielded such concerns as the need for more hotkeys, the 
    ability to stack items, and love for staffs and swords. In addition, hints 
    were dropped about future improvements to daggers and the drop rate upon 
    character death of valued quest items. To read a transcript of the chat, 
    check out:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/devchatoct1.asp">
    http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/devchatoct1.asp</a>. Also be sure to 
    look for our next scheduled dev chat, tentatively set for November 22nd.<br>
    <br>

    This past month, several monarchs made their first appearance on the 
    rankings. Reeve John, Elder, and Varchild have all ascended to rank 7 
    monarchs. However, the top of the list still belongs to Taikou Hellhawk. 
    Ever wonder how these monarchs advanced so far in a world as mercenary as 
    Dereth? For some insight straight from these allegiance leaders themselves, 
    just check out some of the most recent interviews. This month we spoke with 
    the Silver Citadel of Leafcull<br>
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/ASHEsilver.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/ASHEsilver.asp</a>), 
    who had the following advice to give: &quot;Treat your fellow Derethians 
    respectfully; this will pay you back one hundredfold. Choose your comrades, 
    vassals, and patrons slowly and carefully to meet both your adventuring and 
    personal needs. If you start an allegiance, recruit for quality not 
    quantity, and look for integrity and honor above martial prowess. This will 
    ensure that as your allegiance grows, you will have able lieutenants to 
    assist you, and members who make you proud to call them your kin.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Please note that we do not automatically research monarchy rank and vassal 
    number information. This information has to be sent in. Monarchy updates 
    must be submitted at least once every two weeks or you may be removed from 
    the list without notice -- and this update must now include a screenshot 
    verifying monarchy information. Also, when submitting your allegiance site 
    for review, please be sure that the site is complete, the content is 
    appropriate, and the server world you play on is indicated. Send all 
    monarchy updates and allegiance site URL addresses to: website@asheronscall.com. 
    For the list of Dereth's rulers and their clans, look no further than the 
    Allegiance Hall<br>
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/hall.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/hall.asp</a>)!<br>

    RELATED LINKS<br>
    New sites this month include contributions from France (Asheron's Call, 
    France, and Alliance des Seigneurs sur Asheron's Call), South Korea (AC 
    Playforum), and our very first site from the land of the kiwi -- Asheron's 
    Call, New Zealand! For information on the towns of Dereth, Asheron's 
    Assembly has put together an informative guide of their own (<a target="_blank" href="http://alienfantasy.net/games/ac/towns/town_menu.html">http://alienfantasy.net/games/ac/towns/town_menu.html</a>). 
    And we'd also like to give an emphatic, albeit belated, mention to another 
    site that has gone up in recent weeks: AC Trading Post (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.actradingpost.com/">http://www.actradingpost.com/</a>). 
    Now that secure trading has been added to the game, it's more important than 
    ever to know what people are willing to part with... and what they might 
    want in exchange. For the latest list of uber-loot, just check the Post!<br>
    <br>
    Please note that when submitting a site for the Related Links page, the site 
    must not only be complete, but must also relate to the world of Dereth in 
    general. Any site dedicated or preferential to any guild or server world 
    should be submitted instead to the Allegiance Hall, where we would be glad 
    to list it under the appropriate world heading. If you run an AC fan site, 
    and would like to be included on the Related Links page, please submit your 
    URL address for review to: website@asheronscall.com.<br>
    <br>
    An added note, for both allegiance and fan sites: As we do make periodic 
    checks of site links, those sites that have been taken down are 
    automatically removed from our lists. If your site will be down only 
    temporarily for maintenance work, it would help us out a great deal by 
    sending in brief advanced warning.<br>

    PLAYER CHRONICLES<br>
    A new site dedicated to the fiction of Dereth has made its debut this month: 
    The Crossroad Library (<a target="_blank" href="http://homepages.go.com/homepages/c/l/i/clibrary/">http://homepages.go.com/homepages/c/l/i/clibrary/</a>) 
    reserves space for AC related fiction, poems, jokes, screenshots -- a place 
    for anything a good bard dare create!<br>
    <br>
    In addition, we've also linked to the player journal of Miadanu of Glenden 
    Wood (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.beethoven.demon.co.uk/miadanu.html">http://www.beethoven.demon.co.uk/miadanu.html</a>). 
    And three excellent tales have been added to AC's own collection. These

	<b><font size="2">4 -- GAME 
	TIPS</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">Of course, there's far 
    more, and far greater, treasure to be found in the lands of Dereth than that 
    which its monsters carry. From time to time, word spreads of items of such 
    power that the most terrible of opponents have taken to hoarding them away. 
    The only means of recovering such things both rare and wondrous is for one 
    to embark upon quests. The exact number, and resulting gain, of such quests 
    will likely never be known. In fact, the more Dereth is explored, the more 
    its explorers seem to discover. However, this month we'd like to pass along 
    certain valuable tips on truly noteworthy quests, gathered from some of the 
    greatest adventurers in Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Olivier Rognath tells you, &quot;If you come across any strange banderling 
    artifacts, please come see me at once. I am one avid banderling hobbyist. 
    And please, no banderling scalps! I want to study this creatures, not kill 
    them!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    So begins the recent quest for the Banderling Mace. Further information can 
    be gleaned from the pages of AC Tips:<br>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/proba.php3?jump_id=69">
    http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/proba.php3?jump_id=69</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Cousin: I write to report success. I have earned Tallial's trust and 
    assumed a position as seneschal of her castle. In truth it was easy, as she 
    is still caught up in her grief over that fool Tremblant. Inform MacDugal 
    accordingly.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A mysterious note, from a mysterious hand. And one to send adventurers far 
    and wide after Oswald's Throwing Daggers. Other valuable rumors on this 
    quest have recently been updated in the Crossroads of Dereth's quest 
    section:<br>
    <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/compendium/quests/Neydisa/">
    http://cod.xrgaming.net/compendium/quests/Neydisa/</a><br>
    Oswalds_Throw_Daggers.shtml.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, we would be remiss not to mention one of the most popular quests in 
    the game. A veritable holy grail, of sorts, for many -- the Sword of Lost 
    Light. Several guides can be found, from AC Stratics<br>
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.stratics.com/content/quests/soll/soll.shtml">http://ac.stratics.com/content/quests/soll/soll.shtml</a>), 
    to AC Outpost (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.acoutpost.com/Html/quests/lostlight.htm">http://www.acoutpost.com/Html/quests/lostlight.htm</a>), 
    to an updated version in AC Tips following the recent Aerlinthe Isle tie-in 
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/proba.php3?jump_id=55">http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/proba.php3?jump_id=55</a>). 
    Remember, though: While the SoLL proves mighty enough for many a high-level 
    hero, the quest begins with but the relative novice!</font></p>
