      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">March 8, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The collection of crystalline body parts lay 
    jumbled together on the rocky ground. The sun was high overhead, passing its 
    way over the west coast of Dereth, glinting sharply off the faceted edges of 
    the slumbering golem. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The man concentrated briefly. The disparate 
    parts rose and assembled, a hulking man-shape of crystal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perfect. A minor part of the plan to be sure, 
    but as in the art of demiurgy, small things, when organized in the right 
    fashion, can have devastating effect. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He smiled. Soon.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The stone slab, once a chalky rough white, 
    was now streaked through with deep russet stains, haloed by lighter reds and 
    pinks. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nuhmudira looked around the dank, dark room. 
    It stank of death. And yet so much good had come out of it. Thanks to these 
    sacrifices she was able to harness the flow of magic to her desire. Every 
    day new and potent weapons and armor and jewelry were being harvested by 
    Isparians battling to clear Dereth of the beasts that walked their land.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Her first sacrifice not even two months ago 
    had opened the door to items of even greater power. And this next one would 
    set the bar even higher. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yal ibn Rab walked into the room. Not so long 
    ago she would not have known he had entered, but with her current power she 
    had been aware of his presence ever since he had come through the portal to 
    this lair. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He had been the first of the Zharalim to 
    swear to her and her alone. He had recognized the Empyrean threat when she 
    had explained it, promising to do whatever she deemed necessary to thwart 
    any future invasion. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She had used him hard over the past few 
    years, and never harder than these last few months, when she had finally 
    discovered the road to achieve their goals. At last she could provide the 
    Isparians with powerful tools that would help to ward off the Empyreans: 
    blood magic. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Together they had decided that some of his 
    renegade Zharalim comrades who had sought refuge in Marae Lassel would make 
    the perfect sacrificial targets. Already twice-outcast, no one would miss 
    the scattered followers of Hamud ibn Rafik's ruined Tenebrous Edge order. No 
    one would mourn their loss. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“It is done, Mistress.” He never used her 
    name. It was always Mistress, or Malika. Queen. In some ways so formal, and 
    yet at other times he would come dangerously close to insouciance. He had 
    definitely not approved of her decision to take on her new apprentice. He 
    had even dared suggest that they would be better off were he to dispose of 
    the man. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the first time ever Nuhmudira had called 
    him a fool. He had just stood there, silent, as always. She had felt no need 
    to explain all the doors that this apprentice, both intentionally and not so 
    intentionally, was opening for her. Ibn Rab had never questioned her orders 
    before, back when she had only the power of persuasion. She would certainly 
    not suffer intransigence from him now. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She nodded her head for him to continue. “The 
    new oil has been created. Bloodhunter oil. The archers can begin applying it 
    immediately.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As always, he had performed his tasks 
    successfully and efficiently. For the briefest of moments she wondered 
    whether this was something she had to do. He had been the first supporter.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But the apprentice had been clear. The 
    statues needed a quickening agent of great power. The sacrifice required was 
    immense. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She walked to the small table besides the 
    slab, and poured two cups of tea. She took one of them over to ibn Rab. “Sit 
    and share this moment with me, my Zharalim.” He bowed slightly and took the 
    cup and they sat opposite one another at the table. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He brought the tea to his lips. There was the 
    faintest of pauses, his sky blue eyes resting lightly on her, and her heart 
    began to surge with fear. She would have to move quickly to-- </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He took one sip, then put down the cup. He 
    exhaled slowly, and deliberately straightened his dusky robes. The eyes, 
    blue as robin's eggs, found hers. “Why, Malika?” he said, quietly. “I would 
    have done this willingly. All you needed was to ask.” He said no more, but 
    watched her mutely. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The paralysis spread quickly with this blend, 
    and soon he wouldn't be able to talk. She was glad there would be no more 
    words. He slumped quietly. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With a strength that would have been 
    impossible a few weeks ago, she took his comatose body and put it on the 
    slab. She wondered whether he truly would have volunteered. But her 
    apprentice was right, this way was quicker. Less risk. Nothing could delay 
    the salvation of Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Analysis process unclear. Prior loci 
    of power have been established and then overrun by human agents. Nothing has 
    been changed in this establishment to indicate different results.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine ignored the voice. There had been a 
    time when he could make it shut up. Why couldn't he make it stop anymore? 
    No, don't think of that, concentrate on the work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Query: That is the intention? Query: 
    You desire failure? My brethren were similarly afflicted. They labored to 
    create the new Singularity. But I think they were afraid of success. Change 
    is safe when it occupies the realm of the mind only. But to actually change. 
    . . Back in the Singularity there were no distinctions between mind and 
    body. To think was to be. Here. . . very scary.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He found himself thinking of the woman more 
    and more. He could not stop thinking about her. Maybe he should introduce 
    himself. Maybe she actually was his wife, but just dressed up to look 
    different. There was the power to do that over here. He certainly looked 
    different than when he had lived on Ispar. Maybe if he opened her up, he 
    would find his wife underneath. She was so beautiful. He had visited her 
    almost every night. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Illogical. She is not your wife. 
    Query: You wish to place the creature there? Interesting choice. Perhaps if 
    you placed it nearer the wall, it would kill more of the humans as they came 
    through the door.</font></i><font size="2"> </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine growled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">I am just attempting to help. You 
    seem more distracted than usual. Perhaps attempts to assist at this moment 
    are not efficient use of time. I will try again later.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The voice was blessedly silent. Martine 
    resumed finalizing his plans for this new dungeon structure. And thinking 
    about flaxen-blonde tresses draped softly over silken pillows.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience,

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">March 13, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Winter begins to give way to spring, the 
    ground swells with fresh drops of rain, and the first signs of rebirth begin 
    to spread across the land. But darkness ever looms over Dereth, a dark 
    shadow cast by a man with revenge foremost in his mind. He will stop at 
    nothing to see his vengeance complete. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yet there are beacons of hope. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Arcanum, under guidance of Nuhmudira, has 
    constructed towering structures to represent the heroes and foes deserving 
    of respect in towns throughout Dereth. They act as a reminder of the efforts 
    that all Isparians put forth in the defense of Dereth their home. They 
    assist those adventurers as well, another gift given over by the good graces 
    of Nuhmudira and the Arcanum. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rumors persist that the High Queen is 
    planning a new festival when the snows are clear and the spring rains cease. 
    Her guards continue to patrol the fringes of the outposts and defend hapless 
    towns from incursion. She has remained undaunted by Martine's attempted 
    assault upon her and her son. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite these beacons the darkness grows. In 
    the desert Nuhmudira's mansion lies barren and empty. The Aracanum does not 
    speak on the matter at great length and the presence of the Zharalim 
    defending her home make investigation difficult. Some have entered the place 
    and not returned and others are so aghast at the things that they have seen 
    they cannot speak. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Isparians have proven to be a formidable 
    foe to any who stand against them in the past, and so it remains even now. 
    Martine's forces have yet to penetrate and create any type of fortified 
    position on the mainland of Dereth. His efforts having been rebuffed by 
    contingents of warriors intent on seeing his evil thwarted, and the peace 
    that had comforted the land, returned. But now in the Direlands, Martine, 
    after months of failure and frustration, has placed his sword into the earth 
    and created a foothold for his forces. Terrifying new creatures roam the 
    hallways of these strongholds, defending a prize worthy of only the 
    strongest warriors. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are precious few lights of resistance 
    that waver and tremble in the encroaching darkness. The Isparians struggle 
    against this new spreading shadow. Shall they prove triumphant before the 
    last ray of hope is snuffed? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Following is a list of the most 
    interesting additions made to the game this update. However, please note 
    that not everything has been included--that would spoil the fun of finding 
    out all manner of things added or changed! As usual, though, the town 
    criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here are just some of the additions made in 
    the March 13 game update, <i>Persuasion</i>. The following list is comprised 
    of detailed notes straight from the developers themselves. For a summary of 
    things of interest, be sure to consult the official event article, <i>

    <p><span class="Head"><b>New Functionality and Content </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">New quests and new dungeons related to the 
      ongoing storyline have been added. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A new creature roams the Dires. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a new command, <i>@house 
      available</i>. Using this command will give you a list of Cottages, 
      Villas, and Mansions that are both open to the public, and not yet sold. 
      The list currently caps out at 400, although there generally should not be 
      any situations in which more than 400 houses are available at any one 
      time. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Players can now use mana stones and 
      charges on their paper doll to charge all of their items at the same time. 
      When players use mana stones in this fashion, the game computes which 
      items would run out of mana first (including those items which have run 
      out of mana), and recharges those items to maximum capacity, and then 
      moves on to the next item, etc., until the mana stone runs through its 
      mana and is destroyed. As in the original dynamic, excess mana is still 
      destroyed if all your items are fully charged, and you have to re-wear 
      items that have completely run out of mana once you recharge them in order 
      for the item's spells to take effect. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You now receive a warning two minutes 
      before an item you are wielding runs out of mana. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">When people attempt to swear allegiance to 
      you, you now must confirm whether you wish to accept them or not. As 
      before, squelching the person prevents them from attempting to swear 
      allegiance to you, or you may turn off requests to accept allegiance.
      </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    </font><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements and Changes </b>
    </span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">150 Cottages, 40 Villas, and 10 Mansions 
      have been added to the world. We are not currently planning on adding any 
      more Mansions to the world after this Event. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">House Settlement Portals for those 
      settlements added in February have been added to the world. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Fletchers are now able to fletch new high 
      damage arrows and quarrels, named Deadly Arrows/Quarrels. There is a skill 
      requirement of 230 in one's Bow or Crossbow skill to use these weapons. 
      This is a raw skill requirement. Buffs or debuffs to either the skill or 
      attributes feeding the skill or vitae penalty will not factor into whether 
      a player can wield the weapon. There are currently no Deadly Atlatl Darts, 
      although that may change in an update soon. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">At the high levels of treasure, it is now 
      possible to find swords with a range of max. damage up to 32, axes with a 
      range of max. damage up to 30, maces with a range of max. damage up to 28, 
      spears with a range of max. damage up to 26, and unarmed weapons with a 
      range of max. damage up to 10 (although a 10-damage unarmed weapon is 
      extremely rare). Further, there is also the possibility of the treasure 
      system at the high levels generating swords, axes, maces, and spears with 
      a tighter damage variance (so a higher minimum damage). For axes and 
      swords, the tightest damage variance possible is .4 (previously .5), for 
      maces it is .35 (previously .5), and tridents and swordstaffs .5 
      (previously.6 and .66 relatively), and for yaris and budiaqs it is .6 
      (previously .75). </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">All weapons generated with either a damage 
      bonus or a variance bonus will have a wield requirement in that weapon's 
      skill of 250. If the weapon has both a variance and damage bonus, the 
      skill requirement is 260. This is a raw skill requirement. Buffs or 
      debuffs to either the skill or attributes feeding the skill or vitae 
      penalty will not factor into whether a player can wield the weapon. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There is now roughly double the chance of 
      finding magical jewelry with either 2 or 3 spells on it compared to the 
      old rate. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The chances of Focus or Willpower cantrips 
      landing on weapons have been reduced to almost nil, while Weapon Masteries 
      and the 4 Item spells (BD, HS, D, SK) have been increased slightly. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shields no longer have a chance of 
      generating: Bow, Crossbow, Mana Conversion, or the 4 magic school 
      masteries cantrips. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Alchemy now costs only 6 skill credits to 
      train, and 12 total skill credits to specialize. Those characters with 
      trained or specialized Alchemy will have received 2 or 4 credits back.
      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Missile Defense now only costs 6 skill 
      credits to train, and only 10 total skill credits to specialize. Those 
      characters with trained or specialized Missile Defense have received 2 or 
      6 credits back. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The types of weapons generated at the high 
      levels of treasure have been revamped. The rate at which unarmed weapons 
      appear at these levels has roughly quadrupled. Staves have increased 
      slightly. Daggers have been reduced slightly. Atlatls now appear in the 
      high-end treasure system (though not in the low or middle ranges, this 
      will be fixed in April). Nayins, yumis, and longbows, heavy crossbows all 
      appear more; Yags, shortbows, shouyumis, and light crossbows all appear a 
      lot less. Random thrown weapons now appear a lot less. The higher damage 
      swords, axes, maces, and spears now all appear more, their lower damage 
      counterparts appear a lot less (although hiltable swords appear only 
      somewhat less often). </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Gauntlets and sollerets can now be 
      generated through the treasure system with Bow, Crossbow, and Thrown 
      Weapons Masteries on them. These appear on the gauntlets/sollerets at 
      roughly half the rate of the other weapons. Coordination now appears on 
      the gauntlets/sollerets less, and UA, Dagger, and Staff masteries now 
      appear slightly less, while Sword, Axe, Mace, and Spear appear at the same 
      rate. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The chances for various spells to appear 
      on magical jewelry has been slightly altered. Attribute Masteries 
      (Strength, Coordination, etc.) now appear slightly more often than before. 
      Life Protections now appear slightly more than double the rate they used 
      to. The renewals (mana, hps, stamina) now appear less than half the rate 
      they used to. Armor now appears at less than half the rate it used to 
      (although it is still the most common spell). This change affects all 
      levels of jewelry. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Prior to this Event, almost all creatures 
      were only visible on radar when moving in some way. This has been changed 
      so that they are now visible on radar always. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We have improved the monster selection 
      keys slightly, such that you should be more likely to select the monster 
      actually closest to you when you 'Select Nearest Monster,' instead of a

      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There had been a longstanding bug where a 
      player who had never entered a recallable portal had been able to recall 
      to their logout spot. This bug has been fixed. Now, if players have never 
      entered through a recallable portal, and they cast portal recall, it will 
      recall them to their Lifestone instead. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a bug that set everyone's 
      personal spell economy at .92 effectiveness even if the person had never 
      cast the spell before. This has been fixed so that a person's personal 
      spell economy begins at 1.00 effectiveness. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Dye vendors for the Neo Greater Shadow 
      Armor have been added. </font></li>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">March 13, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Persuasion </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    Oodles of changes for the March Event, so let's get started! </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Housing </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    First, for the month of February, while we had (unfortunately) a number of 
    server crashes, we had no confirmed reports of item loss on hooks or in 
    chests, with one important exception, which we'll discuss in a bit. <b>We 
    now believe storage and hooks offer secure storage for your items.</b>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, if you put items into your storage 
    chest or hooks, and some time shortly thereafter (anywhere from immediately 
    after to roughly 10 minutes) the world or specific server where your house 
    resides crashes, there is a possibility that you would lose the items you 
    just placed. Unfortunately, this is a risk that will always be present when 
    storing items in your house. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The good news is that we will continue to 
    place a strong emphasis on ensuring server stability, and aggressively 
    investigating the causes behind any server crash and fixing those promptly.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the items on our checklist for future 
    housing improvements has been implemented this month. With the <i>@house 
    available </i>command, we hope that people will be able to monitor open 
    houses more efficiently than by having to camp individual houses. While the 
    command won't solve the problem of there being more demand for houses than 
    supply, we think Residential Quarters will. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Residential Quarters are an implementation of 
    housing that we plan on releasing either in the April or May Event. It will 
    be a series of linked rooms in a shared space accessible by a portal. Each 
    room can be purchased by a single player, and the rooms offer storage, a 
    recall spot, and a few hooks for players to put items. One of the key 
    advantages of these Residential Quarters is that they allow us to make 
    thousands of these spaces available in a given month, which we hope will 
    help alleviate all players' desires for a space to call their own. Players 
    will be able to own either a Residential Quarter or a house, but not both. 
    Look for more information on the Residential Quarters next month. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also continue to develop regular 
    housing. This month we are releasing another 200 total units: 150 Cottages, 
    40 Villas, and 10 Mansions. After this month we will not be making any more 
    mansions, and instead will be releasing 150 Cottages and 50 Villas per 
    month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our future plans for housing include: </font>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Adding more usable hooks in the Mansions.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allowing players to be able to use pyreals 
      and Writs to purchase additional storage space in their houses. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allowing players to be able to use items 
      while the items are on a hook, and create content that takes advantage of 
      this ability, e.g. questing for a portal to (cool place X) to put in your 
      house. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>One final note: </b>Certain portals to 
    Villa dungeons were broken by a change made right before the March Event. 
    Unfortunately, these portals will not work throughout the March Event. They 
    will be fixed for April, however. These locations are: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.0 N, 46.4 W </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.1 N, 46.6 W </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.3 N, 46.4 W </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.5 N, 46.6 W </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.5 N, 46.1 W </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">23.1 N, 46.1 W </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Skills </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    As you may have already noticed this month, for the first time in over 
    two-plus years of <i>Asheron's </i>Call's existence, we decided to 
    retroactively reduce the skill cost for an existing set of skills. A few 
    months back, we took a look at all the skills and asked whether they, in 
    some form or fashion, were worth their skill cost. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In some of these cases over the years, we 
    have attempted to balance perceived inequities in the advantages of skills 
    versus their skill costs with content. For example, the Singularity Key 
    dynamic was such an attempt, to make Lockpicking worth its 6 skill credits.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ultimately, balancing some of these costs 
    with content was proving to be very difficult or ran a large risk of 
    creating other imbalances. Two skills we felt we would not be adding much 
    additional functionality to (or even if we did, it would not change the 
    basic cost of the skill), were Missile Defense and Alchemy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While Missile Defense definitely has its uses 
    in combat and in allowing one to activate certain magical items, it was 
    certainly not an 8-credit skill. We feel that 6 points to train and 10 
    points total to specialize more accurately reflects Missile Defense's 
    benefits in <i>Asheron's Call</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also felt that Alchemy, while having the 
    most benefits of the craft skills, and therefore worth more than Fletching 
    and Cooking, was never going to get the constant updating through content 
    that might make it worth its 8 skill credits to train and 16 to specialize. 
    So we felt that 6 and 12 brought that skill closer to its actual worth.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So what else is on our skill-balancing plate? 
    First, we should mention that we are <b>not </b>planning to reduce the cost 
    of any more skills, nor are we planning to increase the cost of any skills. 
    That said, there are some skill dynamics that we are planning to either add 
    new features to, or to change entirely. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Appraise Armor, Appraise Weapon, Appraise 
    Magic Item, Appraise Item and Assess Monster are all skills that we are 
    looking to change over the next few months. That is the extent of 
    skill-balancing that we will be investigating over the few months. (This is 
    a separate process from our continued efforts to both balance melee skills 
    with each other and with alternate forms of doing damage such as archery and 
    magic. Our efforts to improve melee skills will continue during this 
    timeframe as well.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the next few months, we will release 
    more information about these changes and what they mean for the world of <i>
    AC</i>. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Melee Changes </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    This month contains the first step we are taking to making the warrior and 
    archer classes of <i>Asheron's Call </i>feel like they are able to compete 
    at the higher levels of <i>AC </i>content with their mage brethren. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One advantage that mages have over the other 
    templates is their ability to “unlock” higher and higher damage potentials 
    as they increase in skill. As they increase their War Magic skill, they are 
    eventually able to cast differing levels of War spells, with each level at a 
    higher damage range than before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Warriors and archers have not had that 
    ability, until now. With Wield Requirements, we are now able to offer melee 
    and missile players an ability to do higher damage as their skill level 
    progresses. Ultimately, we would like to eventually offer an even higher 
    level of damage potential for players, but we will first be monitoring and 
    evaluating how effective this stage is. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few notes about this specific stage: We 
    have intentionally not improved either staves or daggers at this time. This 
    is because of our desire, once all the weapons' changes are made, to have a 
    weapon's true power be based roughly on their skill costs to specialize. In 
    this manner a person who paid 16 credits to specialize sword will be able to 
    out-damage a person who spent 4 credits to specialize dagger (for the 
    purposes of this balancing we have to assume the optimal heritage group for 
    a racial weapon, e.g. an Aluvian dagger character). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the power of the hilt dynamic, we will 
    not be making any changes to dagger until we make our ultimate melee 
    changes. And since staff is only a 4-credit cost to specialize, we are leery 
    of making too many changes to staff until we have a better sense of what the 
    ultimate effectiveness of these changes are. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, we did not add these changes to any 
    hiltable swords. Generally, we did not add these changes to any of the lower 
    damage versions of weapons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our next step in our plans for melee 
    improvements will take 2-4 months to implement (sometime between May and 
    July). We will share more details about the system as we get closer to 
    implementation. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Treasure Changes </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Hand in hand with the weapon changes comes our second set of changes to our 
    treasure generation system. Since we were tinkering with certain systems 
    anyway (such as weapon and jewelry generation), now seemed to be the best 
    time to look at the parameters of what was being generated, and tweak those 
    parameters so that they more accurately reflected the current state of the 
    higher level game in <i>AC</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hence, our changes to the percentages of how 
    often certain weapons spawn at the higher levels of treasure in the game, 
    and the changes in percentages to how often certain spells appear on 
    jewelry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, the weapons. While I know many of you 
    will miss the acid javelins being spawned so often from SIK chests and 
    Singularity Troves, our goal was to make sure that the weapons people are 
    most likely to use at the high levels for a given skill are indeed the 
    weapons actually being spawned. This meant fewer shou-onos and light 
    crossbows, and more longbows and morningstars. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also seized this opportunity to balance 
    out which types of weapons were being spawned. One of the more egregious 
    imbalances of the system was the rate at which unarmed weapons were spawned 
    at the high levels--roughly 2% of the time. This has been boosted to 8%. The 
    snippet in the
    <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEmarch02build.asp">
    developers' notes</a> covers the high level issues, but the basic idea is 
    that the availability of the weapons are loosely tied to their skill costs.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for jewelry, we noticed that the rate at 
    which useful multiple-spell jewelry was being found and used was a little 
    low. To address this, we both upped the chance that multi-spell jewelry 
    would be found, and made it more likely for “useful” spells to be found on 
    the jewelry. While it may have made sense initially for Armor to appear 30% 
    of the time as the spell on a piece of jewelry, it no longer makes quite as 
    much sense some 2 years into the game. We expect to make a change in the 
    next couple of months that will make this dynamic available to even more 
    players, at all levels. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, a couple of design fixes to 
    problems, one old and one new: The old one is the lack of missile masteries 
    (TW, Xbow, Bow) on gauntlets/sollerets. Ultimately we decided that there was 
    no real reason in today's <i>AC </i>to allow the melee skills to have all 
    the fun with these armor pieces. The new one is when we implemented cantrips 
    on armor, we didn't make shields a separate category from armor, which 
    resulted in some useless items (shields with Bow Mastery cantrip, etc.). 
    This has been all fixed now. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Fun </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Sometimes, having played or been involved with <i>Asheron's Call </i>since 
    its inception, it's easy for us over here at Turbine and Microsoft to accept 
    that the game is the way it is, and focus on adapting instead of thinking 
    about what can and should be changed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The way we use mana stones/charges is one 
    example. It's tedious and slow to have to be constantly checking your items 
    to see if they're running low on mana (although the mana bars help), but 
    hey, it's the way the game is, right? Except that we saw it really didn't 
    have to be that way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And that was the genesis for our two tweaks 
    this month to the mana stone: the ability to use it on your paper doll to 
    fill up all of your items at once, in order of their greatest need, and to 
    receive a warning some time before the item actually runs out of mana, so 
    you won't lose that critical Armor 6 or Bludgeon Prot 6 just as the next set 
    of Tusker Guards respawn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another change we made under the vanguard of 
    “Fun”: making nearly all creatures appear on radar. While we appreciate the 
    design considerations that went into the initial idea, we decided that at 
    this stage of <i>Asheron's Call</i>, it was a better play experience to let 
    everyone use their radar effectively. We felt it appropriate to emphasize 
    playability over “reality” in this case. We also recognize that while such a 
    change does not eliminate the usage of certain 3rd party programs, that at 
    the very least it allows those who do not use such programs some of the same 
    gameplay advantages. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, after lots of consideration of some 
    of the dynamics of the “Boss Monsters” we introduced some months back, we 
    decided to address part of the problem directly, rather than waiting for all 
    these melee/missile changes we had been talking about for a long time. While 
    these changes are currently being worked on, we realized that those future 
    changes and the changes that we did make this month wouldn't help a melee 
    player kill a Diamond Lord now. We feel that with the reduction in 
    regeneration rate and armor level, the Diamond Lord is now a much more 
    melee-possible monster to kill. Look for some changes to the other Boss 
    Monsters next month. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Hot Topics </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hollow Weapons--Due to a bug at the last 
      minute, Hollow Weapons changes have been pushed to April. Expect upgrades 
      to Hollow Axe, Sword, Mace, and Spear for the April Event. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As with our changes to mushrooms this 
      month, expect more changes to areas in the future to make it more 
      difficult for players to gain experience by killing creatures while away 
      from their keyboards. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Next Month and Beyond </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    As you saw in the March
    <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEmarch02build.asp">
    developers' notes</a>, we fixed a longstanding bug in which players who had 
    never entered a tieable portal could portal recall to their logout spot. 
    Along those same lines prepare for further changes next month to many of our 
    portal/transportation dynamics. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the highlights: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Everyone, regardless of whether they have 
      Item Magic, will receive the ability to recall to their Lifestone without 
      dying. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Those players with Item Magic will get a 
      host of new features: </font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The ability to “Lifestone tie” so that 
      they will have access to two Lifestones. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A second portal tie, recall, and summon 
      spell so that one can tie to two portals. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The ability to recall through a 
      “last-used” portal if one hasn't learned tie will be removed. In its place 
      will be a new item magic spell, “recall through last used portal” which 
      will be available to everyone with Item Magic. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also in the near future (either April or 
    May), we unveil some changes to one of the most maligned attributes in <i>
    Asheron's Call</i>: Endurance. While we didn't want everyone to run out and 
    start pumping out 100 100 100 10 10 10s or 10 100 10 10 100 100s characters 
    after April, we do want people to think that having more Endurance can be a 
    viable play style, especially if you are a melee character. Look for more 
    information next month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the longer term, we're still going to 
    focus on melee improvements. And we will take a look at the mid-level play 
    experience (defined as level 25-50). Is it challenging? Is it fun? Expect to 
    see some changes there over these next few months. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, just because being a mage may be the 
    most effective way to play <i>Asheron's Call </i>right now, it doesn't mean 
    it's the most fun. Once we implement some of these changes to the melee 
    dynamic, we will then begin unveiling some radical (and fun!) changes to the 
    way magic works in <i>AC</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As always, thank you for playing <i>Asheron's 
    Call</i>. </font></p>

    Asheron's Call 1 (wow, we have to start putting the number in front now) 
    Developer's Chat <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> As always, I am you 
    moderator, Ken Karl, Program Manager at Microsoft for Asheron's Call 1 <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> With me is my counterpart in 
    crime... the other part of the deadly Ken Duo... Ken Troop. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says</font>: I will allow Mr Troop to 
    introduce the rest of the team at Turbine... <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> With us tonight from 
    Turbine are: <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Kim Payson, Les Nelken, 
    Allan Maki, our trio of Content Designers Sean Dickinson, our Data 
    Integrator <br>
    kentroop_turbine says: Todd Berkebile, Sandra Powers, our engineering team, 
    Sean Huxter, Artist at a Distance, myself, Ken Troop, Producer of AC Live
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> and special guest: 
    VonCheeseBiscuit, Missing in Action: A Brandon! <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> OK, on to the questions. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Anliz2K in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Why is Ken such a 
    LOSER!? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> Wow.. thought I answered 
    that last month... I just am... no real explaination <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Ganondorf99 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> When can we 
    expect to see the return of Quiddity Ingots? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> You can expect to see 
    them very soon. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Payson_Turbine says:</font> Here I am! <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> As in Wednesday type of 
    soon. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> For those of you who 
    don't know Turbine lingo to translate &quot;very&quot; as this month <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">msnunrelated in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Is there 
    going to be more space available in house chests in the future? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> It is definitely one of 
    our goals to allow people to purchase more storage space in their chests...
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> using Writs, pyreals, 
    etc. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> At this point we do not 
    have a definitive timeframe of when this would happen. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">OmptimusPrime in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Can you get 
    rid of the junk loot and increase the chances of getting nice loot? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Another &quot;very soon&quot; 
    thing. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> At least for weapons at 
    the high levels <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> No more flaming javelins 
    out of a SIK chest! or at least...a lot fewer <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Our dev notes/March 
    letter to the players will explain in more detail <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> but I think the changes 
    we made make a lot of sense, given where AC is now, 2+ years after ship <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">batsumishi in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will March be 
    the first installment of melee love, or the only installment? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> The first installment. 
    With this month, we're going to have our first &quot;differing levels&quot; of damage, 
    gated by one's weapon skill, i.e. higher damage weapons with wield 
    requirements <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> We think this addresses 
    some of the problems melees face in day to day life...but of course it 
    doesn't help with others <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Rather than wait for the 
    second installment of these changes, which we think will have more of an 
    effect....we decided this month to tweak the Diamond Lord and Oak Golem, to 
    make them more... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> warrior/archer friendly
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> And we will take a look 
    at some of the other Boss Monsters for April. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> In the meantime, we're 
    working on the second stage of these installments, which we hope to get out 
    in the next 2-4 months <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">durwood84 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will we ever 
    see armor that covers the upper legs (aka that we can use with greaves)? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says: </font>Hello all. The main reason 
    we could not do upper leg armor at first was due to the limitations of our 
    palette system. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> While that system can make 
    for some incredible number of variations, there are limitations to it. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> However, we played with it 
    some and discovered that we could do some interesting and fun things with 
    it, which you saw with steel toed boots and other items that change color 
    when you use them. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says: </font>By using a similar system, 
    we could make upper leg armor that changed color depending on what you were 
    wearing elsewhere, but it could not have a set color of its own. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> We have been talking about 
    doing this. When it gets done, I can't say. You could ask Ken... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says: </font>done <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Particle_Golem in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Due to 
    their overwhelming popularity in &quot;preview&quot; screenshots, one can only be 
    beyond confused when not seeing things such as the Dereth Map and Arcane 
    Pedasel, where are they? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> We're planning on 
    releasing them soon, we're trying to wait for an &quot;appropriate&quot; content 
    moment to release them....this will be soon. Not very. But soon. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">SL_Ki_Adi_Mundi in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Hoary 
    Mattekars are a one month thing, correct? We won't see them after Tuesday?
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>No, they are not a 
    one-time thing. They are permanent. They are not going away. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">saturn_78 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> What is the 
    status of the House Item Storage Loss bug? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>Here's the good news:
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> We had a number of 
    server crashes during the month of February, and there were no confirmed 
    item loss cases during those crashes, with one important exception <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> That exception is that 
    if a player placed an item in a hook or a chest, and then up to 10 minutes 
    later, the server upon which their house is stored crashed <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> In that case there is 
    still a possibility of item loss <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> But that possibility 
    will always exist. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> The bugs that we were 
    experiencing, in which players could lose their items, no matter how long 
    they had been in a chest or hook, when a server crashes....that has been 
    fixed. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> And our emphasis is now 
    on, like it always has been, on trying to ensure that the servers never 
    crash <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Formidable_ in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will there be 
    any changes to the &quot;Spot Tie&quot; ability of players who have never gone through 
    any recallable portals? This greatly increases player's ability to combat 
    macro and &quot;jack&quot; other people's quests. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Yes. It's going away in 
    two days. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">volvus in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will &quot;gimped&quot; 
    skills ever recieve a partial skill credit refund? The policy has always 
    been to balance through content, but many skills have recieve nothing for 
    too long. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>With March's Event, 
    users who specialized in Missile Defense will receive 6 credits back <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> If they trained it, they 
    will receive 2 credits back. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Specialized Alchemists 
    will receive 4 credits back <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Trained Alchemists 2.
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> We explain more about 
    the whys of this in our letter to the players <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> But these skills (with 
    the exception of certain melee skills and appraisals) were the ones we felt 
    most needed to be balanced, and we decided that balancing it this way 
    instead of attempting to create new content for it...was the best way to go.
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> But these two skills 
    will be the only skills that receive this kind of fix <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> After this, we still are 
    going to attempt to change appraisals, and offer melee chars more 
    options....but there will be no further shakeups/major changes <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">HonestRocket in AsheronsCall asks:</font> What about 
    the multiple ties you've talked about before? is that very soon or just 
    soon? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> &quot;Real soon&quot; <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>&quot;Real&quot; means about a 
    month from now <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Coming in April, we are 
    doing a number of changes to the transportation system <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>First, everyone, 
    regardless of whether they have Item Magic, will have the ability to recall 
    to a lifestone <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> without dying. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Second, those with Item 
    Magic, will get a number of new spells: <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> The ability to tie to a 
    lifestone (so, is able to recall to 2 lifestones) <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>The ability to tie to, 
    recall to, and summon a second portal <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>Third, the ability to 
    recall through a last used portal, if you haven't learned tie -- that's 
    going away <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> In it's place will be a 
    new spell that repeats that functionality <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> but accessible to all 
    Item Magic users <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Again, this is all 
    planned for April. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>Just in case my wording 
    wasn't clear. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>This new spell would 
    allow you to recall through your last used portal (as long as that portal 
    was flagged as recallable) <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Deaths_Demise in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will a 
    non-Life melee Character ever be able to Kill a Diamond Lord? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>Our goal with the change 
    to the Diamond Lord this month is intended to allow that...I won't say it 
    will be easy, but it should definitely be possible. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">FreeformTurtle in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will there 
    be an upgrade to the functionality of Appraise skills? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>It's hard to be specific 
    about this...since there is still a lot of work that has to be done to get 
    the appraisals where we want them. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Basically, the current 
    idea is to completely rework the current appraisals so that they have little 
    resemblance to what they are used for now. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Ideally, everything 
    could be appraisable by everyone.... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> But the hows of what 
    these new &quot;appraisals&quot; would do is still being determined <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> In the next few months, 
    we should have more concrete info about what we are going to do here <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">GateWarrior in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will 
    Bow/X-bow/Thrown Weapons gauntlets and solls be added to the loot gen this 
    month? And if not, when can we expect them? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>Yes, they are added to 
    the loot gen this month. So you can expect them Wednesday. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">msnunrelated in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will pack 
    dolls ever be brought back? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> There are no plans right 
    now...but it would be nice to make them more available at some point in the 
    future. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Evilincarnite in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Can we 
    expect some better places for us higher lvl chars to hunt anytime soon? Like 
    something for lvl 100+ only <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Over the next few months 
    one of the goals of this team is to make sensible hunting grounds for all 
    levels. We're going to cover, all level groups, but it will take time. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">SoXx_5 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will the @houses 
    available be working? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Yes, this month, there 
    will be an @houses available command, that players can use to know which 
    houses are both open for sale, and not yet purchased. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>We discuss this command, 
    and the general availability of housing in our March letter to the players
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Scorpogee in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Are the minor &amp; 
    major items randomly generated or fixed, i.e. as a shield is created would a 
    random minor be assigned to it's properties? Is that why we see wierd minors 
    on loot? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> it's randomly generated, 
    but within certain parameters <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> The mistake we made with 
    the initial implementation was that shields were counted as armor <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> So that shields received 
    Mana C., Bow Mastery, War Magic Mastery, etc. cantrips <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> This has been fixed for 
    March. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> But basically, weapons, 
    shields, and armor, all have different &quot;lists&quot; that they pull from when they 
    have cantrips. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Flipper_18 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Since your 
    deleting nexus armor on DT will you be resetting the quest so someone else 
    can complete it? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> No <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Anliz2K in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Is the rumor true 
    that we will be seeing &quot;hookable&quot; portals into cottages? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> This is definitely on 
    our &quot;to-do&quot; list. We'd love for players to acquire portals to place in their 
    house. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> It will come after 
    residential quarters, and sometime either before or after incremental 
    storage. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AK_Yo in AsheronsCall asks:</font> When will the 
    decision be made about 'portal housing' for thos of us who just want 
    storage? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> We're planning on 
    releasing &quot;Residential Quarters&quot; either in April or May. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">LowerClock1 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will archers 
    be seeing a coord 6 spell added to the sing bow this month or soon? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> I mentioned this in a 
    forum awhile back: <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> That I originally 
    designed the Sing Bow a long time ago (almost a year), and while I'm sure at 
    the time I had a reason for not putting Coord 6 on the bow (like all the 
    other sing weapons get an attribute mastery)... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>those reasons now 
    completely escape me. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Maybe I thought the 
    10/10 made up for it. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Maybe I didn't. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> So I'll look into it for 
    either April or May, and decide what the best thing to do is. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">q640 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will Mages ever get 
    another level of spells, possibly requiring a specialization in that skill, 
    even for just one school? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says: </font>Nope! Level 7 is as high as 
    the schools of magic will ever be <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">msnunrelated in AsheronsCall asks:</font> What about 
    mage love? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Our current focus is on 
    improving various melee dynamics: to empower them, and make it a more fun 
    experience. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> After that, we have a 
    lot of ideas of how we want to &quot;tweak&quot; magic in AC. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Magic may be the most 
    effective career path in Dereth, but it also is very tedious. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>We want to revisit some 
    of the basics of that system to make it less so. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">newpongo in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will thrown 
    Weapons get quest/loot Atlatls and fletchable ammo soon? (How soon?) <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Payson_Turbine says:</font> Yes, this will be added in 
    this patch. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> The correct answer is VERY 
    soon. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says: </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Payson_Turbine says:</font> We will be adding quest 
    atlatls (such as the Singularity Atlal) over time. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">UN75 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Are you going to 
    allow swords men to x3 strike like daggermen? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Ultimately, whatever fix 
    we implement for melee balance.... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> The skills are going to 
    have be worth relative to their skill cost <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> That's the only thing 
    that makes sense <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>We are not going to 
    outright reduce dagger's ability to compete....the challenge becomes can we 
    tweak the dynamics such that all melee classes feel like they paid the right 
    amount for their skill, but that also they all feel like they can.... <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> compete in Dereth <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> It's an interesting 
    question And one we are attempting right now to address. It will be 
    interesting....I'm not directly answering your question, but I hope the gist 
    is clear. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Prince__Vegeta0 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will our 
    actions ever effect the storyline? Will we ever see a cool dev controlled 
    character like Baelz again? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">les_turbine says:</font> Hi Les here. Eventually this 
    is an experience we would like everyone.. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">les_turbine says:</font> to have. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">newpongo in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Are AC1 devs 
    committed to a LONGTERM future for &quot;Olde Derethe&quot;? Many of us are a little 
    nervous by directions AC2 hints at, and would love to be reassured that old 
    dereth will not be abandoned, and CONTINUE to evolve in 2003 <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says: </font>There is no end in sight for 
    Asheron's Call 1.0. We envision both products running very strong together.
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says: </font>A lot of the change we are 
    currently making is with that in mind. We want players to have fun from the 
    minute they log in to the minute they log out. And we want them to be doing 
    it for years to come. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Brell_Leafcull0 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will the 
    mansions soon be seing some more hook's to use. Only 25 active hooks seems 
    rediculous for such a big house? <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says:</font> Yes, that is also on our 
    house to do list. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kentroop_turbine says: </font>The earliest we would 
    see that in is May. It may take slightly longer than that. <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">mrquazarr_MS says:</font> And our final question... 
    the Asheron's Tradition of ending with Qs that lets everyone go post how

	<p class="MsoNormal">PERSUASION<br>
    Winter begins to give way to spring, the ground swells with fresh drops of 
    rain, and the first signs of rebirth begin to spread across the land.
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>But darkness ever looms over Dereth, a dark 
    shadow cast by a man with revenge foremost in his mind. He will stop at 
    nothing to see his vengeance complete.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Yet there are beacons of hope.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Arcanum, under guidance of Nuhmudira, has 
    constructed towering structures to represent the heroes and foes deserving 
    of respect in towns throughout Dereth. They act as a reminder of the efforts 
    that all Isparians put forth in the defense of Dereth their home. They 
    assist those adventurers as well, another gift given over by the good graces 
    of Nuhmudira and the Arcanum. Rumors persist that the High Queen is planning 
    a new festival when the snows are clear and the spring rains cease. Her 
    guards continue to patrol the fringes of the outposts and defend hapless 
    towns from incursion. She has remained undaunted by Martine's attempted 
    assault upon her and her son.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Despite these beacons the darkness grows. In the desert 
    Nuhmudira's mansion lies barren and empty. The Aracanum does not speak on 
    the matter at great length and the presence of the Zharalim defending her 
    home make investigation difficult. Some have entered the place and not 
    returned and others are so aghast at the things that they have seen they 
    cannot speak.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The Isparians have proven to be a formidable foe to any 
    who stand against them in the past, and so it remains even now. Martine's 
    forces have yet to penetrate and create any type of fortified position on 
    the mainland of Dereth. His efforts having been rebuffed by contingents of 
    warriors intent on seeing his evil thwarted, and the peace that had 
    comforted the land, returned. But now in the Direlands, Martine, after 
    months of failure and frustration, has placed his sword into the earth and 
    created a foothold for his forces. Terrifying new creatures roam the 
    hallways of these strongholds, defending a prize worthy of only the 
    strongest warriors.</p>
    <p class="Default">There are precious few lights of resistance that waver 
    and tremble in the encroaching darkness. The Isparians struggle against this 
    new spreading shadow. Shall they prove triumphant before the last ray of 
    hope is snuffed?</p>

    The latest tales of <i>Asheron's Call</i> and Dereth have been added to 
    fanStory.com. Among the most recent works, Neb has given his growing novel, 
    &quot;The Falling Leaf,&quot; its next chapter. Chapter 9, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/132915.asp">The 
    Lifestone's Curse</a>,&quot; begins:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Darkness receded, and a brilliant world of light 
    exploded into view. The grass, wet with fresh dew, rippled gently in the 
    soft morning breeze. Something was amiss, however. The grass was faintly 
    blue, colored by the gentle glow of a nearby crystal. The wind, the grass, 
    the bright morning sky, none of it appeared to be real. Things just did not 
    fit, like pieces of different puzzles all jumbled together.&quot;</p>
