      <p><span class="Head"><b>Dereth: Morningthaw PY 13 / Earth: April 2002 </b>
      </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      Morningthaw, the beginning of Spring. The death of one season and the 
      birth of another. Perhaps taking their cue from the season, the events of 
      the month of Morningthaw PY 13 seemed to encapsulate this concept. 
      Suspicions about the Bronze Statues, which had been gifted to the various 
      towns by the Arcanum, proved true as they began duplicating themselves to 
      attack hapless residents. Nuhmudira, missing since Coldeve, was found. A 
      brother uncovered the fate of his long-lost sister, leading to the 
      discovery of priceless Isparian artifacts that reminded all of a price 
      paid long ago. Finally, in defiance of those seeking to destroy lives and 
      hope, Grand Sentinels appeared to officiate wedding ceremonies, and happy 
      couples forged bonds of love to face the struggles ahead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Duped by some unknown party, the Arcanum 
    realized that they were responsible for unleashing dark magics on the homes 
    of many Isparians. Frenzied researchers began studying the original 
    incantations and materials used to create the Bronze Statues, hoping to find 
    some clue to how to stop them. The researchers gratefully accepted any and 
    all materials found on defeated statues, welcoming any help they could get 
    in these desperate times. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Compounding the Arcanum's problems, their 
    Head Mistress, Nuhmudira, was still missing. The Arcanum had frantically 
    requested the assistance of all in trying to locate her. As Isparians combed 
    the countryside in their search, they uncovered an ancient Empyrean library, 
    constructed by the Gelidite cult over a thousand years ago. Nearby, they 
    encountered one who had been an aide to Nuhmudira, an enchanter by the name 
    of Kai Mallan. Try as they might, no amount of pleading or threats could 
    induce him to volunteer more about her, other than that she had received the 
    fate she deserved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Giving up on the enchanter, many entered the 
    ancient structure itself. As they progressed downward, they encountered 
    great charred libraries guarded by Elemental creatures of Flame. Amidst the 
    ashes of the library, the adventurers found two books, one not nearly as 
    burned as the others in the library, and one that had remained untouched by 
    the flames. The partially charred book was much older than the other and 
    seemed to refer to the ancient Empyrean constructs discovered two months 
    before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The author of the more recent, undamaged book 
    had evidently been a later Empyrean by the name of Gaerlan. The book was a 
    journal detailing how he had stumbled across the burned Gelidite Library and 
    had been piecing together the knowledge that had been lost. The journal 
    explained that the Gelidites who had built the library had splintered away 
    from the main Gelidite body because of a disagreement over the Great Work's 
    ability to achieve the Gelidite goal of overthrowing the Yalaini Empire in 
    order to establish a new empire under Gelidite control. In addition to the 
    library, the splinter group of Gelidites had built enormous cisterns to 
    collect the Blood of the World, known to Isparians as mana. The channeling 
    of this mana in specific forms had given rise to the Elementals. These 
    Gelidites had felt that their plan to create vast Elemental armies to battle 
    the Yalaini would be more effective than the Great Work of their brothers in 
    Frore. Later, the main body of Gelidites had branded this splinter group as 
    heretical and destroyed them, along with all their works. The Gelidite 
    cisterns had been completed, but there had not been time to activate them.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If not for one clumsy adventurer who stumbled 
    into it, the ethereal wall in one of the library rooms would have remained 
    undiscovered. This wall disguised a passageway leading down to a complex 
    maze. As they entered the maze, many wondered how they would ever find 
    Nuhmudira, if she was there at all. Fortunately, they quickly found a golem 
    that would allow them passage to Nuhmudira's prison, but only if the 
    adventurers could prove she had sent for them. As fellowships explored the 
    maze, they found scattered scraps of paper on the floor. Once all of the 
    scraps were found, they formed a book written by Nuhmudira. The book was a 
    disturbing tale of her betrayal and imprisonment. When shown this book, the 
    golem allowed them to enter the room where Nuhmudira was being held. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As they crossed the threshold, they heard 
    Nuhmudira's anguished screams coming from an unscalable platform high above. 
    Although many cried up to her, she never responded. Throughout this room 
    were scattered clues indicating that the original builders had used this 
    room and its devices as instruments of judgment. On either side of the 
    platform holding the accused was a lever. Pulling one condemned the prisoner 
    to death by ripping a portion of life force from his or her body. Pulling 
    the other lever granted clemency, giving the accused person a portion of the 
    voter's life force. Whoever had betrayed Nuhmudira had placed her in this 
    device. What's more, her captor had made an addition: on either side of the 
    slab holding her were crystals that appeared to be imprinting memories and 
    feelings upon her. Failing to find a way to release Nuhmudira, the Isparians 
    began using the device as it had been intended, each choosing to condemn her 
    to death, or to grant her mercy and restore her life. Her fate then truly 
    rested with the people she had felt she was protecting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the town of Cragstone, Glysander Cartoth 
    was attempting to gather letters written to his long-lost older sister, 
    Lania. Lania had been a long-time friend of Queen Elysa Strathelar on Ispar 
    before coming to Dereth. In the years following the defeat of the Olthoi 
    Queen and before Elysa's disappearance, Elysa and Lania had exchanged 
    letters. The younger Glysander remembered that one letter in particular had 
    disturbed Lania and caused her to leave in search of something, never to 
    return. Glysander had grown up without his sister, but now he wanted to find 
    the letters, perhaps to find out what had become of her. The explorer 
    Brontynn Marshad had promised to track these letters down, but he too seemed 
    to have disappeared. Hearing nothing from Brontynn for several months, 
    Glysander found himself in a panic for any information at all. Kind 
    adventurers came to Glysander's aid and followed Lania's trail. Eventually 
    they rescued Brontynn Marshad from Tumeroks and uncovered a series of 
    letters Queen Elysa had written to Lania. It seemed that Lania had never 
    completely trusted Asheron, and these letters indicated that she had gone to 
    the Underground City in search of some proof that Asheron had lied to Queen 
    Elysa about his intentions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Underground City had been the first home 
    outside of the Olthoi Hives for many Isparians. From here they had launched 
    their final assault against the One Queen. The Underground City was also the 
    final resting place of Thorsten Cragstone. As the adventurers scoured halls 
    infested with Drudges and other vermin, they discovered a previously unknown 
    passage, one that led down to a vault containing Thorsten Cragstone's armor 
    and axe. Apparently, Asheron had used his magics to carve this vault, and 
    he'd left behind Golem servants to protect the Cragstone artifacts from 
    thieves. To the disappointment of those who had hoped that Lania was still 
    alive, her remains were found here. The Golem servants had slain Lania, 
    thinking her a common thief, and since she had never used a Lifestone, she 
    had never resurrected. Adventurers bore this bad news back to her 
    grief-stricken brother, who could at least take comfort in finally knowing 
    what had become of her. At least one benefit came from this sad incident, as 
    craftsmen began making molds of the relics and crafting replicas of them. 
    Now Isparians could have a daily reminder in their homes of the price paid 
    for freedom from the Olthoi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Love is a mysterious and wonderful force, 
    binding people by threads not easily cut. In the past, those wishing to show 
    their commitment to one another had approached Asheron's Sentinels to 
    officiate during their marriage ceremonies. Unfortunately, in recent times 
    this practice had to be suspended. Many rejoiced when these ceremonies began 
    again, and happy couples asked officiating Sentinels to help them seal their 
    vows. Unlike before, couples now had to prove their love through a series of 
    trials symbolizing the various challenges the couple would face together in 
    the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the month closed, and facing continued 
    assaults on their towns, Isparians knew this was not the end of their 
    troubles. They braced themselves as best they could for whatever might come 
    next.<br>
