      Linvak Tukal has stood as a mystery to the Isparians since the fog
      surrounding it was lifted. Now as the snows of the lower mountains
      retreats beneath the springtime sun the last vestiges of the fog fade from
      the citadel, revealing portals guarded by Lugian Raiders, besieging the
      Lugians within.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Making their way through the renegade
      Lugian forces adventurers find that Lugian society is much like their own.
      They have crafters and warriors, merchants and leaders.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In an effort to enlist the children of
      Ispar as allies in their battle against their misguided cousins Lugians
      reward the stalwart with items of great power. Emissaries enter towns all
      over Dereth with gems that contain spells of protection from the School of
      the Heart. These gems house lower tiered spells that last for an extended
      time. Further entwined in the information that the Lugians espouse are
      tales of how their brethren fell to the machinations of the Virindi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Deep within the Direlands the Virinidi
      presence grows. The town of Ayan Baqur has been wrested from Isparian
      control. The inhabitants of Ayan Baqur have been captured and dragged deep
      beneath the sands where they have been stripped of their sense of self.
      Travelers fear for the safety of Ayan's residents as they uncover twisted
      laboratories of the Virindi with remnants of experiments gone horribly
      awry, piecing together that the floating masters of time and space can
      only intend harm to their captives. While in the town proper Virindi
      vendors replace their human counterparts, mocking all who have dealings
      with them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All is not woe and despair. Throughout
      Osteth profiteers who have benefited from their days spent hunting across
      Dereth established casinos to entertain the masses. High stakes gambling
      yields rewards such as Platinum Scarabs and Pyreal Nuggets. Though some
      have walked out with incredible prizes, most leave with nothing more than
      rotting cabbage to show for frivolously spent pyreals, but then that is
      the nature of a gamble.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Outside the gambling dens warriors hunt
      together with heightened cooperation to find greater weapons and tougher
      opponents. Mattekar larger than their remaining cousins have been spotted
      breathing fire and ice from their maws. These new creatures have made the
      further advancement of fellowships enabling one another to recover items
      lost on death a welcome addition.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Spring has arrived, but the evil of the
      Virindi is on the rise and their taint spreads even to those who would be
      allies to Isparian people. Stay focused on the enemy and challenge at hand
      but remember to enjoy yourself as well...</font>
