      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine grinned as the last of the mages fell
      before the onslaught of the Rifts' attack. He had been following the party
      for quite some time, a group of Life wizards that had been much too
      pleased with their recent advancement in spell research.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Apparently the new spells had not been
      quite enough. He looked at the blood-stained clothes of the mages. Such
      new colors the Isparians sported these days. A little morbid but
      appropriate, given the circumstances.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He wished he had time to explore this new
      island. So much death and destruction. His spies had reported that there
      was unrest amongst certain groups of the Isparians, looking for more and
      more adventure. He remembered a time when he too, thought that he needed a
      new frontier, a new area for exploration. He had gotten what he had wished
      for. He anticipated a similar amount of pain in store for these little
      humans.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If only he had free time, he could pick and
      choose at how best to sow the seeds of chaos. His old Virindi chums here
      had actually assembled a sizable force, and he didn't know whether the
      Isparians would be up to the challenge. Martine's plans since killing
      Alayne had not gone exactly as intended. A new Singularity here on
      Auberean would not make those plans any easier to accomplish.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And on another front, his old Exploration
      Society friends had had the audacity to keep on going. Struggling and
      pathetic, yes, but still surviving. And still helping people. Information
      and order disseminated to the new Ispar arrivals. No, no, no, this would
      not do.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But, as he reminded himself, if he had free
      time, which he most assuredly did not, it would take many months before
      his plans reached fruition. If he did not ensure their success, then none
      of the rest would matter.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine smiled once more at the broken
      bodies as he portaled back to his sanctuary. Feazh Zhapaj, indeed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the
      world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. Last month, the citizens of
      Dereth fought back against the invading Virindi, defeating the Inculcator
      and freeing the captured town of Ayan Baqur. One can only wonder what
      additions -- and what dangers -- will be appear with the opening of our
      July event, “<i>Lost in the New Horizon</i>.”</font>

      incredible ongoing story, and we'll see you in Dereth!<br>

      <img src="Chains/side_virindi.jpg" width="80" height="104" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The dog days of Derethian summer have
      arrived. Temperatures rise ever higher, leaving those who wander the wilds
      sweltering in their heavy armor and thick robes. With the approach of
      Summer Solstice, the deadly Virindi accelerate their campaign against the
      residents of Dereth.</font> <br>
&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the defeat of the Inculcator, their
      stranglehold on Ayan Baqur was broken and the beleaguered townsfolk
      returned. Yet only a fool would believe the Virindi so readily defeated.
      Surely they plan to strike again, to retaliate with powerful new servants
      and weapons. The question is where and when. Once again, the legions of
      Ispar must venture forth to stem the tides of war.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rumors spread like wildfire of a strange
      new land, shrouded in mystery and swarming with never-before-seen foes.
      Perhaps those willing to risk life and limb can find a chance to defeat
      the intractable foe on this strange new land... Or perhaps it will prove
      but a short route to a violent and unpleasant demise.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even in the darkest times, there has always
      been good news for the citizens of Dereth. Travelers of late have returned
      to the towns of Osteth garbed in regal new colors, and bearing weapons of
      devastating power. The Consortium of Archmages has finally discerned the
      location of the final Essence, completing the seventh circle of the
      Arcane. One can only hope these developments have come in time to stave
      off the advance of the Virindi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not
      everything has been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      all manner of things added or changed! As usual, though, the town criers,
      barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of
      crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and features
      are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>
      <p><span class="Head"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Highlights include:</font></b>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several new and deadly adversaries have
          appeared to oppose the heroes of Dereth.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As the seasons of Dereth shift, so does
          the crop of dye plants. Some may be found in the most unlikely places.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The battle with the Virindi continues as
          they look to strike back for the loss of Ayan Baqur.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To help combat the new and more deadly
          foes, powerful new magic surges across the land and the seventh circle
          of the arcane is completed.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New publications spread knowledge and
          information among the new arrivals to the mysterious land of Dereth.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Bestower's Guild has expanded its
          selection of titles for those who have truly mastered their craft, as
          well as adding distinctive garb for some.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">The heat of summer has claimed Dereth and our
      continuing saga unfolds to reveal the further machinations of the Virindi.

    <br>
    </font><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 7 Life Magic is in. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Advanced titles for Guild of Bestowers are 
      in. Bestowers also give hats for advanced titles in Alchemy, Cooking and 
      Fletching. Really, we mean it this time. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New summer dye colors available. Winter 
      (!) dye plants removed from landscape. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Component buyer values can now be changed 
      while the vendor is open, and take effect immediately (though it won't 
      remove items from your buy list that are already there). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Component buyer &quot;not enough ... &quot; error 
      message cleaned up a little -- players can raise the number of components 
      they want in the F6 panel and not confuse it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Essence of Enchantment now grants Weapon 
      Ignorance 7. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Upped the Spellcraft on Lightning Streak 6 
      traps. Better pull out the shockproof undies you put away when you outgrew 
      Ash Gromnies? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Changed Quiddity Orb quest timers to seven 
      days. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed some instances where Bestowers' 
      Guild puzzle pieces were showing up as blue casino tokens where they 
      SHOULD have shown up as small orange orbs. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shadow Fragments and Crystal Fragments now 
      have unique icons, for easier differentiation of the various types, and to 
      cut down the possibility of bait-and-switch trading scams. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Koujia armor should now sort properly with 
      the white undies. When the undies changed to white, the new color was 
      bleeding through improperly, ruining some people's ensembles. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ayan Baqur is now (mostly) back to normal.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mud Golems were dropping Muddy Towels 100% 
      of the time due to a small typo in the % chance of not dropping Pyreal 
      Motes. Now they should drop towels at the same rate as Water Golems. <br>

      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> We're happy to be here and excited to 
      discuss the expansion pack. We've been working on it for months now, and 
      it's great that we can finally reveal everything about it! Well, except 
      all the secret stuff, that is. More to the point: many details of features 
      and content are being refined as we go forward, so we can't always go into 
      specifics. And details of our story are being withheld, because we don't 
      want to tell you the story before you get to experience it. But enough 
      introducing! Allez cuisine! <br>
      <br>
      <i><b>mrquazarr_MS says:</b></i> OK, lets begin... <br>
      <br>
      <b>SockPuppet_2 in AsheronsCall asks: Do you have a set release date for 
      the expansion pack? </b><i><b><br>
      slapp_turbine says: </b></i>SockPuppet_2, we we're planning (oops) a 
      holiday season release. We're not getting more specific than that at this 
      time. But we are on schedule. <br>
      <br>
      <b><br>
      LightEmpath in AsheronsCall asks: If a person has multiple accounts will 
      they need to purchase multiple copies for each account or can they have 
      just 1? </b><i><b><br>
      mrquazarr_MS says:</b></i> For every one account that you use to play 
      Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, you will need a seperate copy of the game.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><br>
      Guest_doushikai in AsheronsCall asks: Can you say how much houses will 
      cost? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> While we won't discuss specific 
      prices, we will say that most houses will require varying means to acquire 
      and support <br>
      <br>
      <b><br>
      cannedviction in AsheronsCall asks: Are quests going to be a little more 
      varied and different compared to the AC norm? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> One of the really fun things about 
      working on the expansion has been the opportunity to do a lot more in our 
      quests than we are usually able to do in the monthly props. The quests for 
      Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty are really going to push the edge both... in 
      terms of quest dynamics and quest results <br>
      <br>
      <b><br>
      GuRn3y in AsheronsCall asks: will the pansion have any new graphical 
      enchantments, such as better rendering of 3D platforms, or new 3D engines?
      </b><i><b><br>
      slapp_turbine says: </b></i>Gurney, ACM uses the same graphics engine as 
      the original Asheron's Call, but its art reflects the standards we've 
      developed in our most recent monthly props. (oops: make that AC: DM) So 
      the new island will be prettier! <br>
      <br>
      <b>Dugfromtheearth in AsheronsCall asks: Will there be storage available 
      other then in the houses? </b><br>
      <b>Super_Sayjn_Gohan in AsheronsCall asks: Will my friends who do not buy 
      the expansion be able to visit my home? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> As for Dug's question...No, storage 
      is tied directly to housing <br>
      <i><b>scrap_turbine says:</b></i> Yes, people who do not own, Asheron's 
      Call: Dark Majesty will be able to visit your home. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i><b>MichealTD in AsheronsCall asks: If it will be 'first come, first 
      serve' situation on the 1000 Homes per server, what is to prevent the 
      folks on the East Coast from getting all of the properties before the 
      people on the West Coast even get out of bed? </b></i><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says: </b></i>We've thought about this situation a 
      lot, and while we won't go into specifics, we have a number of things 
      we're implementing to prevent that kind of First Come First Serve problem. 
      In addition, while some houses will be subject to whomever gets there... 
      first, new houses will be opening up and coming down the pipeline, 
      creating a dynamic and fluid housing market <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>MericanPigdog in AsheronsCall asks: Will new types of characters be 
      available in DM? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> There are no new player-character types 
      planned for the game, but there'll be a few new beasties you can meet. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>ElderMT in AsheronsCall asks: Please explain how we will pay “monthly 
      rent” for houses, or at least what happens if we don’t &amp; the house is put 
      on the market. </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> The monthly rent will operate fairly 
      straightforwardly...we won't reveal the exact details of housing 
      abandonment or loss, but there will be a way for those people on extended 
      vacation or similar events to arrange to continue to pay for their house
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Ramuuh in AsheronsCall asks: What will happen to the items in your 
      secure storage if you are unable to pay the rent? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> The current plan is that all items 
      will disappear if you fail to pay the rent <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>ZuZ_IV in AsheronsCall asks: Is the Expansion Pack going to have major 
      updates everymonth like Asheron's Call? </b><br>
      <i><b>crowley_turbine says:</b></i> once the expansion content is in, the 
      live team will continue its monthly process <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>CorpsieAutopsy in AsheronsCall asks: Why should the players have to pay 
      just to get an extra land mass when many feel it should ba a gift to all 
      and how would you restrict passage to this mass tothose who have 
      purchased? </b><br>
      <i><b>crowley_turbine says:</b></i> our monthly content patches will not 
      be interrupted, and we will continue to provide content for all. 
      And yes, I foresee that this will include updates to the content 
      coming in with ACDM.<br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says: </b></i>The expansion pack contains features and 
      content that the live team could afford to do while still publishing 
      monthly updates. We decided a second team was the best way to get the 
      features into the game players wanted. (whoops, I mean &quot;MORE features and 
      content THAN the live team could afford to do...&quot; The expansion pack lets 
      us deliver those features to you. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Guest_Yorlik in AsheronsCall asks: Is the &quot;new land mass&quot; going to be 
      on the current AC Map? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says: </b></i>The new land mass will be on the current 
      AC map. It's our largest terrain update yet, though not as large as Dereth.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>IrishFaerie2001 in AsheronsCall asks: What measurements are you taking 
      to ensure that houses are &quot;thief-proof&quot;? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> I measured Ken Troop, but it didn't seem 
      to help. The thief question is an important one. I can't talk about code 
      details, but if I wasn't extremely sure about the code, we wouldn't be 
      doing housing. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Ethangar4 in AsheronsCall asks: Will the expansion have new enviroment 
      types (new ground textures, etc) or will it be the same old grass, 
      obsidian, desert type scenery. </b><br>
      <i><b>superscooper_turbine says: </b></i>Asherons Call: Dark Majesty will 
      include new environment types that will require unique textures and art 
      assets. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <i><b>Ones_7 in AsheronsCall asks: What is going to happen to the people 
      that buy the expansion pack and don't get to own a house? Being there is 
      only 1,000 available I know if i don't get a house I will be very mad. </b>
      </i><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> We are committed to adding houses to the 
      game after Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty ships. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>KikiJoanofArc in AsheronsCall asks: I want AC DM, but will it be worth 
      buying if AC II is on its way out anyway? Will AC I still be played when 
      AC II is released? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says: </b></i>Yes, we have no plans to shut down AC1 
      when AC2 ships. <br>
      <i><b>crowley_turbine says:</b></i> *breathes a sigh of relief* <br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> So get back to work, Crowley. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Guest_Grensun in AsheronsCall asks: Will there possibly be new weapons 
      classes in DM, such as pole-arms? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says: </b></i>Grensun, there are no new weapon classes 
      in the expansion pack, but we are committed to making sure that every 
      weapon-class &quot;gets some love.&quot; <br>

      <b>Talajzar in AsheronsCall asks: Can people on other accounts be given 
      permission to take things from my house? Such as a monarchy sharing items?
      </b><br>
      <i><b>scrap_turbine says:</b></i> Yes, people with other accounts who have 
      purchased Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty can be granted item storage 
      permission. <br>

      <b>Guest_Satarian in AsheronsCall asks: Will homes in the new expansion 
      affect monster spawn, as they did in Ultima Online? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says: </b></i>Monsters will not spawn in the house 
      area, or right around the house area, so that is taken into consideration 
      as we place the houses around Dereth <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>SheerDisc in AsheronsCall asks: Will houses be located all over Dereth, 
      or just the new land mass? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> Houses are located all over Dereth. We 
      have a map with pushpins in the office marking our &quot;prime real estate.&quot;

      <br>
      <b>Guest_Mest in AsheronsCall asks: You said in the expansion pack each 
      weapon will get &quot;love&quot; in the expansion, does that mean we dont have any 
      &quot;love&quot; to look forward to in the months before the expansion pack? </b>
      <br>
      <i><b>crowley_turbine says: </b></i>like I said before, the expansion pack 
      in no way affects the live team's operations, so 
      you can still look forward to weapon love in the regular content updates
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Angle_39 in AsheronsCall asks: Will you be able to decorate your house 
      in ACM? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> You'll be able to customize your house's 
      appearance through decorations. This will involve a mixture of existing 
      objects in the game, and some new ones designed specifically for 
      decorating purposes. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Guest_Mike_the_Test in AsheronsCall asks: Who will develop content for 
      the island, the XP team or the live team? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> The expansion team is developing 
      content for the island prior to ship. Post-ship, the Live Team will be in 
      charge of further plot developments and quests on Marae Lassel. <br>
      <br>

      access to the contents of the house and stored items. </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> Only the character on the account who 
      purchased the house will be have all the rights and privileges of an owner 
      of the house...however, you can add house-using functionality to other 
      characters of yours in the same way that you can add it to friends of

      see/use new items obtained from the expansion? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> Non-expansion pack buyers will be 
      able to see, and in some cases, use new items obtained from the expansion. 
      Most of the premier items to be gained from the new island though will 
      generally only be usable by those who have the expansion <br>

      lack of marketing, what is going to be done with the expansion to turn the 
      tide and get true new players interested in the best game on the market
      <br>
      <i>mrquazarr_MS says:</i></b> With the Expansion Pack you can expect a

      type setup for housing or all spread out? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says: </b></i>For some housing sites, it will be 
      more of a community type set up, but there will be a number of singleton 
      and unique houses placed as well <br>

      available in the expansion for all ranges of players, from genuinely low 
      level players to players at the upper echelons of the game <br>

      right now... <br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says: </b></i>David Manning says, Every question you

      even if your a member of the current asherons call subscription? </b><br>
      <i><b>mrquazarr_MS says: </b></i>A player will only need to pay for an 
      Asheron's Call subscription or an Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty 
      subscription. Never both. <br>

      only 1000 dwellings being made available to start, is it first come first 
      server or will everyone have a chance to get one? Would clan issued be a 
      better way to approach it? </b><br>
      <i><b>scrap_turbine says: </b></i>We already addressed the first come, 
      first served question earlier, but do remember that there will be 1000 
      dwellings per world, not per server. In other words, DT will have 1000 
      dwellings, MT will have 1000 dwellings, etc. <br>

      definitely expect monthly updates for Asheorn's Call </b><br>
      <i><b>mrquazarr_MS says: </b></i>We have no plans at this time to stop

      on your property or does one just come with it? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says: </b></i>The houses will already exist on 
      locations throughout Dereth chosen by the AC expansion team. <br>
      <i><b>mrquazarr_MS says:</b></i> Wanted to take a moment to clarify the 
      how much housing will be available: Initially there will be 1000 houses in

      for newbies so its not a waste for them to get the expansion pack? </b>

      not decay as long as you own the house. <br>

      level cap of 126 with this expansion set? There are several players on 
      each server that are approachin the cap, and it is discouraging to know 
      that you will not be able to progress after that point </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says: </b></i>There are currently no plans to 
      extend the level cap beyond level 126. While we are aware that a few of 
      our players are approaching the cap, we will continue to focus our content 
      and systems for the wide spectrum of our playerbase, for most of whom, 
      .... the level-cap does not represent a significant or realistic obstacle.

      level or extremely wealthy) get housing and therefore storage? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> Yes, we are designing the housing 
      system so that casual players, even if they are not extremely wealthy or 
      extremely high level, will be able to get houses. 
      While people who have invested the most time in AC will always see a 
      return on that investment, housing will not be limited at all to the 
      &quot;elite&quot; or professional players.<br>

      <b>Movarl_HG in AsheronsCall asks: Can we expect to see the bases of 
      weapons and how damage bonus is figured out changed, rather then adding 
      hilts to rebalance everything?(Which actually balances everything the way 
      it was before. Except dagger is much better for cost vs sword now.) </b>
      <br>
      <i><b>crowley_turbine says: </b></i>as stated before, weapon balance is 
      still being worked on. We recognize that certain 
      weapon classes need some attention, and the live team is working on them.

      bandit hilts on everything.<br>

      of prices for homes before the expansion gets released? I would like to 
      start saving.. </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> We're not letting people know what the 
      prices are in advance, as that would give some an unfair advantage. We're 
      taking steps to make sure there's a level playing field for players who 
      want to buy a house when they become available. Can't get into more 
      details now. (BTW, Stormy just chased KenTroop away from his keyboard with 
      a Nerf Gun...) (which shows how tough Troop really is ) <br>

      secure storage also have access to your decorations? </b><br>
      <i><b>slapp_turbine says:</b></i> just without the love. Only the owner of 
      a dwelling will have access to the decorations. The owner can grant 
      storage access permission. <br>

      <b>Thistledove in AsheronsCall asks: Will there be unique items in the 
      expansion pack? If so, will this mean the premium players will be able to 
      sell them at premium prices? </b><br>
      <i><b>kentroop_turbine says:</b></i> There will be unique and very special 
      items available through the expansion pack. However, many of these items 
      will not benefit non-expansion pack users (or in some cases, anyone who 
      didn't acquire the item through the quest), so while they're great... 
      items, there won't be much of a secondary market for them <br>

	<p class="MsoNormal">As the sunlight filtered through the trees, 
    illuminating the sparse clearing, a voice broke the afternoon silence. 
    &quot;Yeah, but that's just a rumor, Mathias didn't actually see it happen and 
    you know how much he exaggerates.&quot;<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;Presently a pair of figures emerged from 
    the underbrush, rustling the leaves of the bushes with their passing.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;One 
    was of slender build, dressed in a flowing hooded robe of the deepest blue, 
    and carrying a smooth staff of polished oak. The other was a bull of a man, 
    with broad shoulders and a thick unkempt beard, wearing a battered and worn 
    breastplate of what must once have been the finest Aluvian steel. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I don't know,&quot; commented the slender figure.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;&quot;He 
    seemed pretty convinced to me. Besides, did you see the marks on Tornath's 
    armor? Talk about creepy.&quot; </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">As the large figure turned to respond, the air in the 
    clearing seemed to compress and distort. With a groan, the large man fell to 
    the ground clutching his head as his knees buckled under the intense 
    pressure. Staggering to the aid of his fallen comrade, the slender figure 
    glared nervously around the clearing. As he reached down to pull the 
    stricken warrior back to his feet, a blast of energy slammed into the back 
    of the fallen warrior, accompanied by a roar of wind. The hapless warrior's 
    body was thrown violently into the air, as the force of the blast carried 
    him several yards before dumping him unceremoniously into the underbrush.
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Spinning around to face the unseen assailant, the 
    slender mage began to chant in short desperate breaths. But before the spell 
    was complete, several robed and hooded figures emerged from the shadows at 
    the edge of the glade. Gliding in silence towards the chanting magician, 
    their sickles flashing in the sun, the inhuman attackers bore down on their 
    victim with cold indifference and uncanny speed. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Glancing back at his fallen companion in hopes of aid, 
    the young mage cursed his luck. As he jerked his head back the strange new 
    foe, he felt an impact on his chest accompanied with a searing pain, and 
    found himself thrown violently back against a tree. Looking down in 
    surprise, he noticed a strange blue sickle buried in his chest, and his 
    life's blood soaking into the dark fabric of his robes. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">As his eyesight dimmed, and darkness closed around him, 
    he looked up into a stark white mask and heard an ethereal voice whisper, 
    &quot;The Quiddity brings only death for your kind. You will be flayed as your 
    meat body burns over the inner fires of their purity. Your destiny was not 
    always so, but you have unknowingly condemned yourself, and this world.&quot; </p>

    THE NEW HORIZON<br>
    With the introduction of the Lost in the New Horizon event, the 
    assault of the Virindi has unleashed chaos and fear across Dereth. 
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Raids of 
    lightning speed have been reported all across Dereth, accompanied by rumors 
    of a dangerous new Island. Populated with never-before-seen creatures of 
    unimaginable power, even hardened adventurers tread lightly on its shores.
    </font></h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Survivors of the conflicts have begun to return bearing 
    strange new weapons of devastating power. Yet most find their mere survival 
    in the face of the Virindi aggression to be reward enough. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Mages and warriors find themselves pitted against foes 
    of terrible and deadly power, but they face their foes with powerful new 
    magic. The Consortium of Archmages has finally discerned the location of the 
    final Essence, completing the seventh circle of the Arcane. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In recognition of the valor and skill shown by the 
    defenders of Dereth, the Bestowers Guild has announced a new assortment of 
    titles for those who have truly mastered their chosen profession. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">And in spite of the carnage and bedlam surrounding 
    them, the travelers of Dereth have been seen wearing clothing of colors not 
    seen in Dereth in many months, as well as several ominous new shades. </p>

    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="2">A LETTER TO THE PLAYER ON 
    THE GEAR FIX </font></h1>
    <p class="MsoCommentText"><font size="2">July 6, 2001</font></p>
    <p class="Default">As part of the June update, we attempted to put in a 
    change that would allow us to detect the use of speed-altering programs to 
    alter a player's game. As a result of this change however, we had an 
    unexpected bug that made the servers crash. We immediately removed that 
    change to allow the players to continue playing while we examined what was 
    wrong and how we could re-introduce this detection functionality.</p>
    <p class="Default">We have been working on improvements but we wanted to 
    feel certain that when we did re-introduce this functionality, it would not 
    result in the same downtime we saw the first time. We feel the players have 
    suffered enough downtime as a result of speed-altering programs. In order to 
    ensure the stability of this patch, we are devoting extra time and resources 
    to it, and so it will not be part of the July update.</p>
    <p class="Default">We are happy to announce that July will be content-heavy 
    and you will see the next chapter in our ongoing storyline. Lots of exciting 
    quests will be introduced in July as well.</p>
    <p class="Default">We are committed however, to bringing an end to the use 
    of speed altering programs in Asheron's Call and may at any time, without 
    notice, re-introduce the detection functionality into the game. At that 
    point, just as before, we will be taking swift action against players who 
    use these programs.</p>
    <p class="Default">We thank you for your patience while we work on the 
    problem. We hope you all enjoy the July update.</p>
    <p class="Default">Thank you,</p>
    <p class="Default">The AC Team</p>
    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="2">MORE DETAILS ON THE 
    ASHERON'S CALL: DARK MAJESTY EXPANSION PACK </font></h1>
    <p class="Default"><b>Overview </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: What is Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty? Is it a new 
    game? Is it AC2?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: No, Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty is an expansion pack 
    that includes the original Asheron's Call, and all-new exclusive features 
    and content. It is not a new game from the ground up like the sequel to 
    Asheron's Call.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: When is Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty coming out?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: It will be available in stores Winter '01.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: Do I need to buy the original game before buying 
    Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: No. Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty contains the full 
    version of Asheron's Call, including all the monthly event data as well as 
    new features and content.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: Do I need to create a new character in order to play 
    Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: No, you can use your existing characters.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: If I already own Asheron's Call, do I need to buy 
    Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty to keep playing?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: No, you can continue to play without buying the 
    expansion pack, but you will not be able to enjoy the new features Asheron's 
    Call: Dark Majesty has to offer.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: How much will Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty cost?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: It will cost $19.95 and includes one free month of 
    service. This one free month of service will apply to both new and existing 
    players.</p>
    <p class="Default"><b>What's New in Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: So, why would I want to buy the expansion pack?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: First, only players who have purchased and registered 
    the expansion pack will be able to… OWN HOUSES! Yes, Asheron's Call: Dark 
    Majesty will feature true 3D landscape housing. Secondly, only players who 
    own the expansion pack will have access to secure item storage. Lastly, you 
    need the expansion pack to explore the new landmass -- which has lots of new 
    quests and enemies for players of all levels. It is much bigger than any of 
    the additions we have done before!</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: What if I don't buy Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, what 
    am I missing?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: You'll still be able to participate in the overall 
    ongoing story, and be able to roam over most of Dereth -- but you will not 
    be able to own a home, or visit the new land mass.</p>
    <p class="Default"><b>Housing </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: Does everyone who buys Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty 
    get a house? What if I don't get one right away, can I still get one later 
    on?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: Housing space in Dereth is limited. At the launch of 
    Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, there will be approximately 1,000 homes 
    available in each; however, more can be opened in following months in 
    response to demand. We will manage the growth of housing very carefully.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: What do I need to do to buy a house?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: We're keeping the details under wraps. For now, we can 
    say there will be a purchase cost and ongoing upkeep payments that must be 
    made to maintain ownership of a house; if those payments are missed, the 
    house will be put back up on the market.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: Can my friends visit me in my house? What about people 
    who don't have the Expansion Pack?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: Yes, as a homeowner you have complete control over who 
    can come in your house (even when you're away) and who cannot. People who do 
    not have the expansion pack will be able to visit your house if they have 
    your permission, but won't be able to access your storage.</p>
    <p class="Default"><b>Item Storage </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: How will item storage work?</p>
    <p class="Default">A. Each house will contain a chest. The chest can store 
    up to X items. The owner of the house may also store items as decorations in 
    their house (e.g. hanging the sword of great woe on the wall, laying down a 
    series of rugs, blah, blah, blah --you get the picture).</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: Can people steal stuff from my house?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: It's possible. You may authorize people who have also 
    purchased the expansion pack to have access to your storage chest, giving 
    them extra item storage even if they don't own a house themselves. These 
    authorized people will have full access to your storage chest, so only give 
    those rights to players you trust! However, only the owner of the house can 
    remove items used as decorations; accordingly, items used as decorations 
    will be secure from theft.</p>
    <p class="Default"><b>New Landmass, Monsters, and Story Arc </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: So, what's the new land?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: It is a vast new land. We will provide more details 
    later, but its name is Marae Lassel, which translates to &quot;The Sheltering 
    Isle.&quot; Sounds like a nice, peaceful place, eh?</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: How big is Marae Lassel?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: We are not releasing exact dimensions at this time. 
    However, the new landmass will have multiple towns on it, if that gives you 
    an idea of the scale.</p>
    <p class="Default">Q: I imagine there are new monsters too.</p>
    <p class="Default">A: Yup. Without revealing too much, we can say some of 
    the existing creatures in Dereth have mutated dramatically, and there are 
    some brand new enemies as well. They all contribute to the third epic story 
    arc to take place in Asheron's Call. As you may know, the first arc 
    concerned Bael'Zharon and the shadow attacks; the second is well under way 
    right now; and the third begins when Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty launches. 
    We'll be showing screenshots and artwork over the next few months to give 
    you a better idea of what we're talking about.</p>
    <p class="Default"><b>Other Questions </b></p>
    <p class="Default">Q: What other cool stuff will be in Asheron's Call: Dark 
    Majesty?</p>
    <p class="Default">A: Right now, we're only saying that housing, item 
    storage, and the new lands will be in the expansion. These features are our 
    primary focus for the expansion pack, but we may add things as time permits.</p>
