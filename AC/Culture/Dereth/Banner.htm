    <i><p><small><font size="2">&#147;And there are golems in the mountains that I haven't
    seen since the last time I went to the Dires, &#148;Kouron said, with a cool hunter's

    pleasure that will be.&#148;</font></small> </i> </p>
    <i><p><small><font size="2">Lo Ma shook his head and muttered under his breath;

    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Fulfilling our commitment to bring players 
    a world-altering event each month, we've opened “To Raise a Banner of 
    Flame”. These days in Dereth have grown dark indeed, the sun's light 
    filtering through motes of ash in the air. Along with these dark skies, the 
    orange burning sun - threat of fresh danger fills the realm. High-level 
    heroes have been seen staggering back to safer towns, claiming to have come 
    from a hereto unseen land; their claims have been questioned, however, since 
    none of these survivors seem able, or willing, to map this land's location. 
    Instead, content to nurse soot-blackened faces and anoint searing burns, 
    they vehemently warn all listeners against retracing their steps. Tis not a 
    land for the novice, they warn. Tis a place sure to see bones of the mighty 
    among us. According to their tales, new and stronger monstrous kin have 
    surfaced in Dereth, include one unnamed horror of terrible strength. A beast 
    worse than a veritable rain of fire! those heroes claiming to have faced it 
    cry. </p>
    <p align="justify">Whatever beast these men allude to, true evidence of 
    fearsome monsters has surfaced just east of the Direlands. The straights 
    leading in have become flooded with tougher creatures, apparently fleeing 
    eastward from their old home, pushed out by the stronger forces appearing 
    there last month.</p>
    <p align="justify">Whether these stories are to be believed or not, July's 
    event promises some prominent changes in the game. Other strange new rumors 
    have spread through the towns - rumors of a powerful new force effecting the 
    magic of all of Dereth's adventurers. A force these rumors call: 
    “anti-magic”. The implications of this force are dire for some - already 
    many magic shops have begun hiring guards and boarding their windows in 
    fear, as if this “anti-magic” would march from the hillsides like an army of 
    Olthoi soldiers. In addition, entirely new weapons, including strong 
    variations of maces and spears, have been discovered - some weapons 
    comprised of elements never before seen!</p>

    <p><font size="2">Here are just some of the details from the July 11, 2000 
    game update: <i>To Raise a Banner of Flame</i>. This list is culled from 
    &quot;check-in&quot; notes submitted by the game developers themselves. Notes of 
    greatest importance are listed first. </p>
    <p>Not all changes have been included with these build notes - that would 
    spoil the fun of finding out everything that has been added or changed! 
    Also, some changes provide ways for players to drive our evolving story 
    forward, and thus we won't entirely reveal them here. As usual, though, the 
    Town Criers, Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the 
    trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and 
    abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety. </font></p>

&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Squelch has been updated. There is now a new set of commands to enable 
      a user to take more control over their gaming experience. The improved 
      functionality will allow you to squelch all characters from a single 
      player. You can also filter out unwanted messages, such as assessment. All 
      other previous functionality of squelch remains the same. For a complete 
      list of all commands, try the in-game help by typing: /help squelch, /help 
      filter, /help advancedsquelch and /help messagetypes. </li>
      <li>All wands, whether new or previously owned, fire more slowly. </li>
      <li>All quest-item wands, whether new or previously owned, use half as 
      much mana. </li>
      <li>Only new non-quest-item wands will use half as much mana - we were 
      unable to change old non-quest-item wands. </li>
      <li>Certain monsters, such as Olthoi, Lugians, Zefirs, and Phyntos Wasps, 
      are more likely to switch their targets than before, and attack those who 
      are hurting them the most. </li>
      <li>It less likely that you will pop off the edge of a mountain and slide 
      down the slope. </li>
      <li>Strange new weapons with properties unseen before in Dereth have been 
      added. </li>
      <li>More powerful spears and maces have been introduced. </li>
      <li>The maximum stacking size for spell components has been increased to 
      100 and for craft items to 50. </li>
      <li>New spells to discover have been added! </li>
      <li>New extremely powerful monsters, residing in a place yet to be 
      discovered by powerful adventurers, have been added . . . be careful where 
      you tread! </li>
      <li>The problems with players receiving &quot; You are not a Player Killer &quot; 
      error, or (if PK) hurting themselves while firing arrows, have been fixed.
      </li>
      <li>Using mana stones on Compound Bows now brings up a confirmation panel.
      </li>
      <li>Monsters in some dungeons now regenerate a bit more slowly, to prevent 
      the dungeons from getting too overloaded. </li>
      <li>New and exciting dungeons have been added for all to enjoy. </li>
      <li>Added alchemy/fletching/cooking mastery to the treasure system - magic 
      hats now have a 5% chance of having one of these spells on it. </li>
      <li>Chances that a Diamond Golem will drop a heart have been increased.
      </li>
      <li>The odds of getting a trophy from certain banderlings have been 
      increased. </li>
      <li>Corpses no longer float! Gravity has sucked them back down to earth.
      </li>
      <li>Ambient sound upgrade project has begun. The center of the Obsidian 
      Plain and volcanic regions have received love in this update. More to 
      come. </font></li>

    <p><font size="2">If you're only interested in the Shadow Hunter armor 
    issue, scan down to the bottom . . . </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Feedback </b></span><font size="2"><br>
    Sometimes we love it, other times we hate it. But we all agree that it's one 
    of the most important factors in determining what we do. Right now there are 
    a couple of ways that we communicate with you: </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">1) Through the monthly spin from Turbine articles. 
    Basically, this is a one-sided conversation, where I (or another member of 
    the dev team) respond to what we've been reading on message boards, fan 
    sites, and hearing in the game. Trying to wrap up every outstanding issue 
    into one brief article does help you get an idea what we're thinking, and 
    why, but also skimps on facts concerning some of the “real issues” that are 
    being discussed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">2) The monthly development chats. In the past, we've had 
    as many as 6 or 7 dev team members answering your questions (is that too 
    many of us, or does it help you in getting the info you want?). While not 
    the best way for us to respond to all the major questions you have, it does 
    have the benefit of allowing individuals to post specific questions and get 
    a response directly from us. Unfortunately, a number of questions seem to 
    come up month after month which have been addressed in previous chats, or 
    the questions are so specific that we'd need to have all the design specs in 
    front of us to calculate the correct answers. Probably the worst situation 
    is when we get a question about something that is definitely going to happen 
    in a certain time frame: these we really cannot answer with specifics, 
    although we want to. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">3) Reading and posting to the fan sites. Normally, we hit 
    the top two or three fan sites and post responses occasionally to message 
    threads that are burning out of control (granted, we start a lot of those 
    fires!). This method seems to work because we can see what the general 
    consensus of the crowd is, post a few questions or comments, and get a lot 
    of feedback from all of you. In a sense, we push and pull the conversation 
    in certain directions and see where the thread goes from there. The 
    arguments between posts - as long as they're kept insightful and not simply 
    diatribes - are invaluable to us in shaping future changes to the game. 
    Unfortunately, a lot of our audience are very casual players, or lurkers, 
    and never post. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">4) Individual email, IRC, in-game conversations, and 
    feedback from the online team. These are probably the most focused ways for 
    us to answer questions - virtually one-on-one. Unfortunately, the ratio of 
    players to Turbine employees is so incredibly high, that we'd never get any 
    work done if we relied on this method more than we currently do. The online 
    team (advocates &amp; sentinels) are a great way for you to communicate, as they 
    let us know general trends and the “mood” of the community. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">5) Face-to-face meetings. We loved meeting a bunch of fans 
    over the weekend, and I think we got some great feedback from many who 
    attended. Unfortunately, to get through the entire AC player base, we'd have 
    to hold hundreds of these gatherings in different locations around the world 
    almost non-stop! Obviously not a practical solution (but fun to imagine!).
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What does that leave us with? Five fairly ineffective ways 
    to establish a meaningful dialog, except when used together! That's why we 
    use them all. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Well, I'm turning to you for help. How can we improve the 
    communication between the development team and you? In particular, I'm 
    interested in hearing ideas about how we can make the monthly development 
    chats more effective, and how we can better use the message boards to 
    establish some kind of meaningful dialogue with you. You'll soon see a new 
    online form that you can use to enter suggestions, which we'll begin to use 
    in addition to combing the various fan message boards. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So, what's a solution? For now, start posting to the 
    boards (yes, even you lurkers!), if you haven't already, with your opinion 
    on how we can communicate more effectively back and forth about the major 
    topics of discussion. Soon, you will be able to use our online form to send 
    us comments and ideas. We need to know what works and doesn't work for you, 
    and you should know what to expect of us as well. Please also feel free to 
    suggest any other methods that we can use in addition. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We want to know what's on your minds as much as you do 
    ours. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So, what's on your mind? </font></p>
    </small></small><p align="left"><small><small><font size="2">Scott 
    Herrington <br>
    Producer, AC <br>
    Turbine Entertainment &nbsp; </font></small></small></p>
    <small><small>
    <p><font size="2">PS - Many of you will probably notice a “new” person from 
    Turbine posting to some of the boards. His name is James Cowgill. He's 
    actually been at Turbine longer than I have, and he's helping to manage and 
    schedule the ongoing content development for AC. Please treat him with the 
    same respect that you've given myself and the other Turbinites who post, and 
    go easy on him as he gets into the swing of all things AC. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Shadow Hunter Armor Debacle </b></span>
    <font size="2"><br>
    OK, we screwed up. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Content in the game is always subject to change, since we 
    can only speculate on how any addition we make to the game will be 
    unbalancing, overpowered, or useless. It's only when we see the stuff in 
    action that we can assess whether or not we made mistakes. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the case of the Shadow Hunter armor, we made it too 
    good. (Agree? Disagree?) </p>
    <p>That was mistake number one. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Mistake number two was making changes to it without giving 
    you any warning. As somebody wrote in, the people we really hurt were the 
    more casual players who were in the middle of the quest. We made AC a game 
    of “have and have not's”, something we did not intend. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We had debated whether or not to give some warning to you, 
    but thought that would have encouraged massive camping (something we try to 
    avoid) and mass hysteria. In hindsight, we would probably prefer some 
    camping/hysteria rather than losing the trust of our players by removing the 
    armor without warning. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We're sorry about that and will try to notify you better 
    in the future about changes of this magnitude. Nonetheless, the nature of 
    some changes will require us to surprise you, in order to prevent very bad 
    camping. </p>
    <p>On the bright side, for those of you who are still trying to get yourself 
    a good set of Shadow Hunter armor, changes will be coming that should still 
    make it worth your while. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">There will always be some unique stuff introduced and 
    removed from the game throughout the years to come. So you didn't get the 
    “vintage” Shadow Hunter armor, but new stuff will be coming that you can get 
    - and that players who start after you may never have a chance to quest for. 
    AC is only 9 months old, and new items are being added all the time. By this 
    time next year, you may be handing “vintage” Shadow Hunter armor to newbies 
    because something bigger and better has come along that makes shadow armor 
    useless to your character. </font></p>
    <p><small><small><font size="2">Regardless, I wanted to let all of you who 
    have spoken out (both in our defense, and those who pointed out our 
    mistakes) to let you know that we <i>are listening </i>to you and <i>
    reacting </i>to what you have to say.</font><small><small><small><small><!--Channel_Footer--><!--End Channel_Footer--></small></small></small></small></small></small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small><small></small></small></small></small></small></small><!--Channel_Footer--><!--End Channel_Footer--></small></small></small></small><hr width="65%">

    of people say that July's big mysterious quest has been solved. Some are 
    disappointed the Black Fire stone is the only apparent reward, and some 
    believe that, like Nexus,the stone was only available once. <br>
    <br>
    As the lead designer of the big quest and Aerlinthe Island in general, I'd 
    like to take a moment to allay your fears. The quest has NOT been completed, 
    and IS repeatable. There's a good deal more to be discovered and 
    experienced, and this quest will remain unchanged for the forseeable future 
    - like the Atlan Stone quest rather than Frore or Nexus. Don't worry about 
    missing the fun if you're low level, and good luck to you all. Keep 
    questing. The biggest things are not always the most vital... <br>
    <br>
    You can applaud (or curse...) Jesse &quot;Nei&quot; Kurlancheek for doing the stats 
    for every single monster that has killed you on Aerlinthe. He also was 
    generous enough to balance the quest items, and fix bugs with the quest 
    while I was on vacation. Elliot &quot;The Machine&quot; Gilman, of course, performed 
    his usual overtime work making sure that everything made it in, in a form 
    that didn't crash the servers. Sean &quot;Needs A Nickname&quot; Huxter, also as per 
    usual, did every single piece of new artwork for monsters and items, 
    including the oh-so-fashionable Aerlinthe t-shirts. Ron &quot;McEnroe&quot; Winter did 
    some new sounds as well - when you hear the ground rumble in the Tenkarrdun 
    Foundry, that's his work (he also made the Shadow Spire howl). <br>
    <br>
    I'd also like to take a moment to note that the &quot;frozen wasteland&quot; island 
    was not supposed to be open for play for some time yet, and it is only 
    reachable through a bug. It is still in a very early stage of construction, 
    as evidenced by the extreme performance hit in the ice gardens - the degrade 
    art for those beautiful ice upwellings has not been completed, so everyone 
    on the screen is rendering at full detail, no matter how far from it you 
    are. <br>
    <br>
    There are no plans to open the ice island anytime in the near future, 
    although its construction began at the same time Aerlinthe's was. The 
    landscapes of the new islands were designed by artists Pete &quot;Obsidian Span&quot; 
    McDonald, Sean &quot;Shadow Spire&quot; Turbitt, and Bil &quot;End of Beta Comet&quot; Mauritsen.

	<font size="2"> 
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">A lone warrior staggered into the Arwic 
	healer's shop, the last of his<span lang="en-us"> </span>strength all but failing. He didn't even bother ordering any services<span lang="en-us">
    </span>aloud -- merely gestured to the empty loft upstairs and started the climb.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>The healer on duty rushed to his side, dropping the broom he'd been using<span lang="en-us">
    </span>to sweep volcanic ash out of the doorway.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;You're one of the killers, aren't you?&quot; the healer whispered. He nodded<span lang="en-us">
    </span>slightly at the warrior's red sash.<br>
	<br>
	At first, the warrior said nothing. Then, with a ponderously deep<span lang="en-us">
    </span>groan, &quot;Is my presence not welcome then?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No -- our guild heals all. As you well know -- your guild makes the most<span lang="en-us">
    </span>use of our services . . . I merely wondered why you came alone. Very<span lang="en-us">
    </span>dangerous in your profession, I should think.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The warrior, helped into a bed, groaned even deeper. &quot;I've trade notes, old<span lang="en-us">
    </span>man . . . to pay well for your silence.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Oh, you mistake me. We healers are not as mercenary as . . . well, as<span lang="en-us">
    </span>others can be. But without fellow members of your allegiance around? You<span lang="en-us">
    </span>must take great care, sir!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Rolling to his back, the warrior revealed a sickly burn in his chest. As of<span lang="en-us">
    </span>late, the healer had seen a host of new wounds -- grievous injuries caused<span lang="en-us">
    </span>by maces and spears . . . Now this -- another mark left from the terrible<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Plasma Golems, he thought, wondering just what mixture of salves to use.<br>
	<br>
	The warrior's eyes closed, and the healer wondered if the man hadn't fallen<span lang="en-us">
    </span>asleep -- or expired -- that very moment. But he managed a few words<span lang="en-us">
    </span>more. &quot;I lost my kin on the Isle of Aerlinthe . . . battling magic to<span lang="en-us">
    </span>dispel magic . . . You're right! Hide my trade notes! And hide - this - as<span lang="en-us">
    </span>well.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	With the last of his strength, the warrior flung aside his cloak --<span lang="en-us">
    </span>revealing a dagger clutched tight in his hand. The healer pried it free<span lang="en-us">
    </span>from the man's grip and dried blood, examining the weapon in the window's<span lang="en-us">
    </span>light -- a pale light, filtering through heavy ash in the air. Not a<span lang="en-us">
    </span>warrior himself, the healer saw many an artifact of war. Still, never had<span lang="en-us">
    </span>he seen a weapon the likes of this. In learning his craft, the healer had<span lang="en-us">
    </span>studied well Dereth's ores -- yet had little idea of what material<span lang="en-us">
    </span>comprised the dagger. Chorizite, he guessed. The strange metal circulating<span lang="en-us">
    </span>these days mostly in the form of rumor. And now he held a dagger made of<span lang="en-us">
    </span>the very stuff?<br>
	<br>
	In any event, he'd spoken true -- a healer would never betray the<span lang="en-us">
    </span>wounded . . . but the warrior would not wake before he consulted Arwic's<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Master Blacksmith as to the nature of this weapon.<br>
	<br>
	As weapons of this world change, the healer reasoned, I must learn the<span lang="en-us">
    </span>wounds they're destined to inflict.<br>
	<br>
	He left the warrior, asleep in the light of an ash-darkened sun.<br>

	TOP 10 LISTS/MONARCHY<br>
	In recent days, AC has posted the first of a series of Top 10 lists,<span lang="en-us">
    </span>starting with Veteran Ranks, Chefs Extraordinaire, and -- our personal<span lang="en-us">
    </span>favorite -- Dereth's Doomed. Be sure to look for more lists in the days to<span lang="en-us">

	<br>
	One list that has been around for some time is the Monarchy List. Although<span lang="en-us">
    </span>we try our best to tabulate and verify all claims to Dereth's top rankings,<span lang="en-us">
    </span>recent complaints have forced us to enact stricter policies. In order to<span lang="en-us">
    </span>remain on the Monarchy List, all monarchs must submit updated information<span lang="en-us">
    </span>at least once every two weeks -- including a screen shot which clearly<span lang="en-us">
    </span>shows monarchy information. Incomplete information will be ignored, and<span lang="en-us">
    </span>monarchs who fail to provide updates will be taken down.<br>
	<br>
	At the time of this writing, however, we would like to congratulate<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Skystreak Cloudrider for maintaining the top position at Rank 7 with 2175<span lang="en-us">
    </span>followers. We would also like to give special recognition to Wren the<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Blurry, who recently ascended to Rank 7; both monarchs are scheduled to<span lang="en-us">

	PORTAL SPACED<br>
	The following comes from a player named Briggs, posted on the Crossroads of<span lang="en-us">
	</span>Dereth Dev<span lang="en-us"> </span>Board. Parodying &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, Briggs argues whether 
	mages'<span lang="en-us"> </span>ability to drain from<span lang="en-us">
    </span>behind walls should 
	be &quot;nerfed&quot; or removed from the<span lang="en-us"> </span>game.<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: I'll ask for the fourth time. Did you drain?<br>
	<br>
	Mage: You want answers?<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: I think I'm entitled to them.<br>
	<br>
	Mage: You want answers?!<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: I want the truth.<br>
	<br>
	Mage: You can't handle the truth!<br>
	<br>
	Mage (continuing): Son, we live in dungeons that have walls. And those<span lang="en-us">
    </span>walls have to be guarded by mages with wands. Who's gonna do it? You? You,<span lang="en-us">
	</span>Briggs? I have<span lang="en-us"> </span>a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. 
	You<span lang="en-us"> </span>weep for warriors and you curse<span lang="en-us">
    </span>archers. You 
	have that luxury. You have the<span lang="en-us"> </span>luxury of not 
	knowing what I know: That draining<span lang="en-us"> </span>through walls, while<span lang="en-us">
	</span>tragic, probably saves lives. And my magic, while grotesque and<span lang="en-us">
    </span>incomprehensible to you, saves lives.<br>
	<br>
	You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk<span lang="en-us">
    </span>about, at pubs, you want me behind that wall. You need me behind that wall!<span lang="en-us">
    </span>(boasting) We use words like Feazh, Zhapaj, Malar . . . we use these words<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;
    </span>as the backbone to a life spent researching spells. You use them as a punch<span lang="en-us">
	</span>line. I have<span lang="en-us"> </span>neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself 
	to a<span lang="en-us"> </span>warrior who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very vulnerability<span lang="en-us">
    </span>spells I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd<span lang="en-us">
    </span>prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest<span lang="en-us">
    </span>you pick up a wand and stand behind a wall. Either way, I don't give a darn<span lang="en-us">
    </span>what you think you're entitled to.<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: Did you drain behind a wall?<br>
	<br>
	Mage: I used the skills Turbine gave me.<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: Did you drain behind a wall!?<br>
	<br>
	Mage: You're ***damn right I did!<br>
	<br>
	(silence)<br>
	<br>
	Briggs: Please the court, I suggest the developers be dismissed so that we<span lang="en-us">
    </span>can move to an immediate Article 39a Nerf Session. The witness has rights.<br>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">CHARACTER TEMPLATE<br>
	The following template was submitted by the Zone's own Daniel Adam:<br>
	<br>
	&quot;Here is what I believe to be the best Sword template around. This is after<span lang="en-us">
    </span>playing dozens of different styles/templates since Dec 16:&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Race: Aluvian<br>
	Specialized: Sword, Melee Defense, Arcane Lore<span lang="en-us"> </span>Trained: Healing<br>
	<br>
	Attributes:<br>
	Strength: 100<br>
	Endurance: 20<br>
	Coordination: 100<br>
	Quickness: 90<br>
	Focus: 10<br>
	Self: 10<br>
	<br>
	Notes:<br>
	1. Starting killing rabbits/drudges/shreths, and keep assigning XP to<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Health/Endurance, Sword/Melee Defense, and<span lang="en-us"> </span>
	Strength/Coordination/<span lang="en-us"> </span>Quickness.<span lang="en-us">
	</span>Basically<span lang="en-us"> </span>advance in blocks of 5 -- so first boost Health by 5, then<span lang="en-us">
	</span>Endurance by 5, then Sword by 5,<span lang="en-us"> </span>then Melee Defense by 5, then 
	Strength,<span lang="en-us"> </span>etc. At level 5 start putting XP into 
	Arcane Lore and<span lang="en-us"> </span>Focus, as this will<span lang="en-us"> </span>later enable 
	you to wear magic items. I recommend that you have Arcane<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Lore<span lang="en-us">
	</span>at 50+ by level 10 and 100+ by level 20.<br>
	2. Acquire Item Enchantment at level 9, Creature Magic at level 25, and<span lang="en-us">
    </span>finally Mana Conversion.<br>
	<br>
	Things to keep in mind:<br>
	1. Always make sure you are sync'd to the closest lifestone to where you<span lang="en-us">
    </span>are fighting.<br>
	2. Don't just jump into random portals -- some lead to death.<br>
	3. Remember that things that attack you from the back will kill you easier<span lang="en-us">
    </span>than from the front (shields help).<br>
	<br>
	&quot;This should get your hero started!&quot;<br>

    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="2">1. Only one questions per

    the least about. If you ask more then one, we will have to pick the one to

    when your turn comes up. Due to the volume of people, we will only wait a 
    short period for the questions before we move on. <br>
    3. Watch for repeat questions. If you are asking a question that was already 
    asked, we will simply reply with an: &quot;Asked and answered&quot; and move on. <br>
    4. Final one, which has never been a problem for you guys, but I have to say 
    it: Remember, the Code of Conduct is in force here ;-). </font></span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="2">OK, I will hand the floor 
    over to Eri to introduce everyone else here today and then we will be off to 
    the questions. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; I'm Eri &quot;reijin&quot; Izawa, co-lead designer for Asheron's Call and 
    general spec shuffler. With me today are these great flavors of the AC Team: 
    Jesse &quot;Nei&quot; Kurlancheek, game designer, scripter, general systems guy. David 
    &quot;Crowley&quot; Javier, game designer, dungeon maker, and dialogue meister. Dave &quot;Sarneho&quot; 
    Namerow, Turbine-side Community Manager. ...and introducing newest catchy 
    flavor, James Cowgill, AC Producer. <br>
    <br>
    I will go through the usual introduction: To give you an idea of our 
    schedule, we are already hard at work on the August event. So we can with 
    some confidence answer questions about that material (though we won't give 
    away all the secrets ;-). That said, we usually cannot give you concrete 
    dates or feature details for anything new beyond one or two months out. And 
    even then we may not be able to. This is because of many factors, including 
    the experimental nature of events, schedule changes, and the fact that 
    something that looks simple may turn out to be very complicated or even 
    impossible! In other words, promising specifics for many of your suggestions 
    would be premature. We don't like promising things we might not be able to 
    deliver. Also, because we have so much planned, new requests on the boards 
    or from here may not be implemented til some time after the suggestion is 
    made. But I want to assure you that we are listening! The spellcasting UI 
    changes happened in large part because of your suggestions at a chat much 
    like this one some months ago. Again, thanks for coming! Let's go.... <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Alrighty.... <br>
    <br>
    <b>Solamar&gt; Hello! Thank you for such a cool game! One question. We really 
    need some type of &quot;Stash&quot; for characters. Are thier plans for this? This 
    would be VERY useful to Patrons and Monarchs. Not to mention those who love 
    bartering with others as I do. ... <br>
    <br>
    Solamar&gt; Down with the mules I say! Maybe use an NPC and allow us to buy 
    space at 10K per Pack? This would go hand in hand with the Secure Trading 
    System many were hoping to see in this months patch. Thanks! GA. <br>
    </b><br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; It's on our list of things we'd like to do, but there are no 
    current plans for it, as we are hard at work on some other systems. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Item storage has a host of technical issues and would require a 
    LOT of time. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; In an ideal world we'd do it in a flash :) <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Done. <br>
    <br>
    <b>jhaw&gt; Hello. I noticed that monsters are allowed to cast spells with out 
    the aid of channeling devices. Why are we not allowed to cast spells with a 
    weapon in hand like shadows? ga <br>
    </b><br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Most of it simply boils down to complications with the 
    animation data. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; I'm not totally up on the technical issues involved, but 
    it's actually difficult to have monsters hold on to wands. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; As for in-game responses... Monsters are more innately 
    magical...? <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    <b>Kr0n1K&gt; When will Lugian Hammers use &quot;Axe&quot; skill like they SHOULD instead 
    of &quot;Mace&quot; skill which they currently feed from?, I mean, what is the point 
    of a Hammer when lugians already have a mace and morningstar.., It should be 
    easy so I hope it rhymes with must, <br>
    <br>
    Kr0n1K&gt; i mean it would be a good olthoi weapon with def, GA </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; It's a known bug, actually in my &quot;to fix&quot; queue. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; So Lugian hammers should start behaving normally soon. 
    Unfortunately, I won't be rhyming tonight. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    <b>SirXavier1&gt; Sit tight, you are in for a long question or rant, whatever 
    you wish to call it. In June new spells were added to war magic, same in the 
    most recent update... <br>
    <br>
    SirXavier1&gt; The known ones, two of them are useless, streaks and walls. Even 
    rings are useless without life magic. The most expensive skill ingame is the 
    most useless without life magic. In PvM and PvP. High level PvM with just 
    war magic, is beyond annoying, every mo <br>
    <br>
    SirXavier1&gt; every monster over 100(except magmas and altered drudges) have 
    uber health, and/or uber spells. High level melee by far surpasses war magic 
    in PvM... <br>
    <br>
    SirXavier1&gt; Currently war magic is worthless at high levels, unless you have 
    life magic. Why? Why must the most expensive skill in game require you to 
    have life magic to be viable? War magic is not worth 16 to train or 28 to 
    spec, even with the new spells... <br>
    <br>
    SirXavier1&gt; Something still needs to be done. Either give skill points back, 
    1 for trained, 3 for spec'ed so it won't throw anything out of balance, or 
    new uber war spells that are not effected by life need to be added. Is 
    anything planned... Done </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; It has been somewhat acknowledged that War Magic is 
    underpowered. However, don't expect to see a decrease or &quot;giveback&quot; on War 
    Magic skill credit cost. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We want to improve war magic's effectiveness, but as you 
    can see, balance is a very tricky issue. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Additionally, there are some tech issues involved. I saw 
    Jesse bumping his head into some of our tech limitations recently. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We haven't given up on War Magic, but I don't think you can 
    expect any more War Magic buffing soon. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    <b>RESiSTANCE_JaS&gt; Great game guys, Really love what you have done with it. 
    Lot better than that &quot;other&quot; game ::coughs:: EQ ...Ok... the question, Even 
    though we just got Solclaim, are we getting any other worlds any time in the 
    near future? um Snowreap? among others =) GA. </b><br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Ken's got it :) <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; We are always looking at performance and concurrency on a 
    near daily basis to ensure that we have adequate worlds for the current 
    player base. When we see a trend, we will act on it. There is always a 
    possibility of new worlds. <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; Turbine and MS aren't finished optimizing the code or 
    servers. We are always trying to both, increase the server load and looking 
    at how many total worlds are needed. <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; done <br>
    <br>
    <b>Liart&gt; Suggestion: Create item spells. Level one would make a crude 
    lockpick/healing kit for exampe. Level six would make a peerless. Then when 
    the spell expires the item would expire... <br>
    <br>
    Liart&gt; Especially nice now that hollow weapons nullifies items main 
    usefulness.. Ok, now for my question... <br>
    <br>
    Liart&gt; Have you seen my corpse? Oh, and on a side note, Decado (FF) wants to 
    know - &quot;How much would a woodchuck would chuck if a woodchuck would chuck 
    wood&quot;... <br>
    <br>
    Liart&gt; *slaps Nei and Crowley around with an IRC-brand trout* :) GA! </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Okay... thanks for the suggestion... <br>
    <br>
    <b>wynterwolf&gt; To expensive to have archers with atlan and hollow arrows but 
    any plans for some new arrow heads? Race specific for PvP? Critter specific? 
    Exploding to knock open those stubborn locked doors? I can think of plenty!
    <br>
    <br>
    wynterwolf&gt; Here is one way to add a money sink and give high fletch skill 
    something to do. Besides, we need something to do between snapping bow 
    strings! Done <br>
    </b><br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Unfortunately, there's a lack of support for item creation 
    within our code. It'd demand new tech, and we already have a lot of new tech 
    backloaded. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; I saw your corpse, you should get to it soon. And 
    woodchucks don't chuck wood. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Done <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Sorry about that wynter, I moved you up a little too fast.
    <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Reading your question now. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; There are currently tech reasons why we can't do critter 
    specific, race specific, or exploding missile weapons.... <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; We are still looking at bows &amp; thrown weapons for possible 
    future features, though. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; As Davej said, we have a lot of new tech queued up in the 
    schedule already. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Done. <br>
    <br>
    <b>shefner&gt; With the last update and some of the bugs &lt;specifically the bug 
    relating to stamina to mana it has become obvious that there is little or no 
    actual playtesting… <br>

    shefner&gt; of the patch materials. (Sorry, but a SINGLE casting of the

    </b><br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; I can understand your perception of with some of the bugs 
    which make their way to the live servers. <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; Unlike other software products and games, AC can't be fully 
    tested until something is actually on the live world. <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; The fact is, it's a huge world which has two dedicated test 
    teams (one at MS and one at Turbine.) <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; With the rate that events are created and propped, we do 
    make mistakes. <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; We try very hard to put up clean props, and when we make a 
    mistake, we try to determine the effect and correct it as soon as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
    Cowgill@Turbine&gt; There is no way that we will ever have a perfect game, but 
    the goal remains to make it as good as possible and a lot of resources are 
    dedicated to doing that. <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; It is unfortunate that some bugs make it into the game, and 
    we do regret that. But having a complete &quot;bug free&quot; game probably will not 
    happen either, no matter what the game. <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; One of the restriction we have, that other MMORPGs do not 
    have, is that we constantly are evolving our storyline with new events and 
    content. <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; It is very important for this information to stay 
    confidential until it is rolled out. <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; This is why we do not open our next update to public 
    testing as other do. <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; DONE. <br>

    <b>Seifer_Rules&gt; this is a long question, not sure if im cutting and pasting 
    right, but here goes.. /me is frustrated.. <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; Why is it that the new dispell spells cost so much mana.. i 
    mean seriously you have to cast it multiple times to dispell everything, and 
    the only spells i care about are the level6's.. then i have to fully 
    rebuff.. i think the mana cost should be brought <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; wayyyy down, at level45 my mana isnt even 280 yet. i have been 
    casting 6's for the last 15 levels it kinda sucks because you add these 
    great spells, and make them not even worth casting. then you go and make the 
    spell comp impossible to replenish, so we a <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; are scared to even cast the spells.. why cant you guys make 
    mages fun to play anymore. i have made a melee guy now because my mage is 
    worthless.. im sorry to be a whiner but i was so happy to see that dispells 
    were added.. and now i cant even use them bec <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; ecause my mage is worthless.. im sorry to be a whiner but i 
    was so happy to see that dispells were added.. and now i cant even use them 
    because you only get 40 spell comps EVER, then the mana cost is way to high 
    to even cast them.. whats the point in addi <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; whats the point in adding the stuff if people wont even use 
    it. i thought you guys would learn from last month when the only time people 
    used the disk spells were to p <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; reform light shows in the middle of town for noobs to ooo and 
    ahhh over.. <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; im just very frustrated, i love being a mage, but every month 
    is just like another slap in the face, every month since the game went 
    retail.. please will you guys do something to show us that you want us to 
    keep playing? I guess my real question is... <br>
    <br>
    Seifer_Rules&gt; what are the chances that you will be making the new spells 
    worth the effort... <br>
    <br>

    Crowley@turbine&gt; As far as I can tell, the question you asked is &quot;why do 
    dispell spells cost so much mana.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Look at it this way. For each dispel you cast, you negate 
    several spells. That's a deal. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; But the real answer to the question is that they have to be 
    balanced. If they didn't cost as much as they did, balance might have swung 
    too far in the wrong direction. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We'll keep looking at the costs of new spells, but I don't 
    expect to see them changing any time soon. <br>

    an A+! I hope you do more quests this way. <br>

    alecmuzzy&gt; Now for my question... <br>
    <br>
    alecmuzzy&gt; Why are there so many changes made to the game to balance PVP 
    (removal of Mattekar Robe, Nerfing of Shadow armor) when less than 10% of 
    the customers play PVP? It seems a little unfair to us PVM players who just 
    feel nerfed as a result. <br>
    </b><br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; There were *two* changes in July directed at PvP: wand 
    animation slowdown and the hollow weapons. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; The Hoary Mattekar robes were never intended to be 
    available for more than that one month. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; The shadow armor change was not because of PvP 
    considerations, though those were part of the equation. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; As for numbers... It's more than 10%. PvP is not a 
    majority, but they are definitely a significant minority. <br>
    <br>

    have to consider them also. <br>

    Evil_Elvis_&gt; Well, mages still rule all when it comes to damage, and

    being cheap, doing good damage, and having that nice shield. Archery,

    debuffs, and crazy high missle defense, it seems you've forsaken archery to

    waste alot of time, just to do max dam <br>

    rei@Turbine&gt; Uhhhh, lots of that sound cool, though we'd rather go with a

    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Yes, we can do new staff art, though it depends on what new 
    staff material is going in, and eventually we're likely to put in new staff

    <b>LuckyCerridwen&gt; This Question is for Nei (::shakes him to wake him up::) 
    Hello, I am Trinidy of Frostfell. Ive waited 6 hours (and countless weeks) 
    to ask this long question. <br>
    <br>
    LuckyCerridwen&gt; I have noticed since the two most recent updates that 1) 
    Mages (life and war mages in particular) are getting far less exp as opposed 
    to there warrior type counterparts. I’m not speaking of draining through 
    walls - life mages- , I’m referring to life mage <br>
    <br>
    LuckyCerridwen&gt; who go toe to toe with Gigas. And get bunkus for exp And 2) 
    Sword users seem to be doing significantly more damage these days. I am a 
    lvl 34 axe user and I have the quest item Crimson Silifi <br>
    <br>
    LuckyCerridwen&gt; with BD VI, Coord VI and Def VI activated. And sword users 5 
    to 10 levels lower then me with significantly lower stats are getting these 
    kills over me. Is there an explaination <br>
    <br>
    LuckyCerridwen&gt; explaination for either of these occurances? I am at the 
    point where I HATE sword users and refuse them as Vassals and even Friends. 
    Will something be done about this in the near future Something that rhymes 
    with bust? </b><br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We haven't done anything to life mages' XP, aside from the 
    &quot;drain behind the wall&quot; code from some time ago. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; As for swords... Sword mechanics haven't been touched since 
    they got the variance bonus months ago. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; I hate to call this observer error, but there certainly 
    haven't been any changes in the data that would account for this. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; So no need to discriminate against sword users. You might 
    want them in your allegiance if they're kicking butt. <br>
    <br>

    Crowley@turbine&gt; We could. Don't think it's not a tempting idea. There are 
    in-game reasons (backstory and such) that Tuskers should be nonmagical. <br>
    <br>

    <b>Reprisal_X&gt; Hello all <br>
    <br>
    Reprisal_X&gt; Recently, there has been a revelation on many of the message 
    boards that people have been exploiting a duping bug to duplicate large 
    numbers of items utilizing a bug when the servers are reset. Apparently, the 
    bug was thankfully only used by a small <br>
    <br>
    Reprisal_X&gt; group (some whom have apparently even sold duped items on E-bay 
    making a RL profit) and although it appears it is harder to do now it is 
    still exploitable. Question: Are you aware of this situation? If so, what 
    have you/are you going to do to deal with <br>
    <br>
    Reprisal_X&gt; it? <br>
    <br>
    Reprisal_X&gt; Apparently one guy sold enough duped stuff on E-bay to buy a 
    used car. <br>
    <br>
    Reprisal_X&gt; Finished. </b><br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; We are aware of the situation.... <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Basically there were some problems a little while back that 
    made this easier to do; hopefully it should be much harder now. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; If you continue to see major problems please do point it out. 
    Thanks! <br>

    <br>
    tjmax&gt; playing aspect somewhat. <br>
    <br>
    </b>rei@Turbine&gt; (Is this in the Dires or where?) <br>
    <br>
    <b>tjmax&gt; Are you intending to increase the players abilities to become more 
    powerfull (stats, spells weapons and armor) and ballance it out PvM so they

    they have gathered for the past 9 m <br>

    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Are we intending to increase the players abilities.... <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; If necessary. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Balance is ongoing... I've long been interested in tuning 
    higher level play. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; However, it must be done very carefully. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; A level 30 player can get one-shot killed by a level 100 
    monster.... <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; A level 70+ player can also get one-shot killed by something 
    equivalently tough. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Again, extending higher level gameplay is something we're 
    interested in doing, but it will require some serious analysis first. <br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Done. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Qmann&gt; Hi, a suggestion first, can u pls post some more &quot;technincal&quot; info 
    about the working of the game, like the explanation u did about the XP 
    reducing code, examples would be to explain how the spell economy works, or 
    why do we still take damage during lag <br>
    <br>
    Qmann&gt; without doing any damage... My question is why did u reduce the spawn 
    rate in the Horde Nest? it is unbearable now! u should rename it the 
    &quot;abandoned&quot; nest. If it was because of lag, then at least make it something 
    in between! <br>
    <br>
    Qmann&gt; BTw I kinda like it that u nerfed the GSA because evryone was 
    starting to look alike! Done. <br>
    </b><br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; People don't seem to believe it when we tell them this, but 
    the BSD and the Horde Nest were causing problems with the servers. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; Not just in-dungeon lag, but they were actually causing a 
    strain on the entire server farm. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; The lag wasn't the only reason involved in the reduction of 
    spawn rates, but it was the strongest reason. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; We're trying to figure out ways to bring back the 
    experience of being cornered by a dozen angry Tuskers, but there are 
    technical issues we have to dance around. <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; So we'll probably keep tweaking the Horde Nest and the BSD. 
    Hopefully we can find a happy compromise between play experience and server 
    load. <br>
