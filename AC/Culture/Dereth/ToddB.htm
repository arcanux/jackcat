		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
		<img border="0" src="ToD/195.jpg" width="160" height="240" align="right">Hello 
		boys and girls, my name is Todd Berkebile.&nbsp; I'm the glint of fear in 
		Ibn's eyes.&nbsp; I'm a house broken code monkey who bangs on the keyboard 
		all day and all night until the compiler churns out a working game.&nbsp; 
		I've been at Turbine for about three and a half years now.&nbsp; For the 
		first, oh, year and a half I was on the AC Live Team where I did a 
		little bit of everything, from bandwidth improvements and server 
		stability work to wield requirements, slayer weapons, and the Olthoi 
		Arcade.&nbsp; After dealing with some particularly horrific database problems 
		and other headaches I was ready to work on some other titles, so I moved 
		into our core technology team where I got to work on brand new systems 
		for our latest generation game engine.&nbsp; After a few Boston winters I was 
		ready to get out of town.&nbsp; When we decided to do an Asheron's Call 
		expansion and we decided to do it in sunny LA I knew the time had come 
		for me to return to the West Coast.&nbsp; And I must say things are certainly 
		pleasant on AC now; maybe it's just the weather.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What do you actually do?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I write code.&nbsp; That's basically it.&nbsp; I 
		focus on the core technology aspects of the game which basically means 
		that most of the code I write goes largely unnoticed by the average 
		player.&nbsp; I work mainly on things like getting the new UI system to work, 
		handling input, improving network communications, performance 
		improvements, server systems, and many other things that cannot be 
		described using normal English.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">How did you end up here?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, in a way it's all Richard 
		Garriott's fault.&nbsp; Ever since I first played Ultima I: The First Age of 
		Darkness (I played the re-released PC version in 1986, not the Apple II 
		version in 1980) I have dreamed of creating massive virtual worlds where 
		thousands of players could romp and explore. &nbsp;I actually taught myself 
		C++ because the Ultima clone I had written in Basic (not Visual Basic, 
		not even GWBasic, just plain Basic) was too limited. &nbsp;For years I waited 
		in vain for this seemingly obvious evolution of the RPG.&nbsp; Then one day 
		Ultima Online was announced; I signed up for the beta the first day they 
		accepted applications.&nbsp; But alas, the game never worked on my computer.&nbsp; 
		Years later I discovered that the game would only use the first network 
		adapter in your machine, but my machine had two network cards and the 
		first adapter was for my internal network.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the time, however, I was busy working 
		as a Software Design Engineer at Microsoft on the Windows team.&nbsp; Lacking 
		the time to bother with a beta that wouldn't run on my machine, I 
		continued working on products like Windows 98, Internet Explorer 4.0, 
		Windows Millennium, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.&nbsp; Despite what you 
		might hear from cute little penguins the programmers at Microsoft are an 
		amazingly talented and dedicated group.&nbsp; I learned more from 4 years 
		working at Microsoft than I had learned in the previous 17 years I'd 
		spent coding on my own.&nbsp; I still think fondly of those years but 
		eventually another longing started to pull me away.&nbsp; It all began one 
		day in the Microsoft company store.&nbsp; Employees can buy Microsoft 
		products at cost, which at the time meant any game that Microsoft 
		published could be purchased for $10.&nbsp; Well needless to say I basically 
		bought them all.&nbsp; One day there was this ugly brown box which I hadn't 
		noticed before.&nbsp; It said &quot;Asheron's Call&quot; on the front and I'd never 
		heard of it before.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">Perhaps it's a telemarketing 
		simulator or something?</font></i><font size="2"> I thought. <i>Sounds 
		horrid, but hey it's only $10 so what the heck.</i>&nbsp; </font></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Needless to say by the time the first 
		event, &quot;A Sudden Season,&quot; went live I was completely hooked.&nbsp; A game 
		that could change so significantly on a monthly basis hardly seemed 
		possible and yet here it was.&nbsp; Not only did the game itself fascinate me 
		but the technology that would make it possible truly tantalized me.&nbsp; As 
		some of you no doubt remember I started a website called &quot;Todd's Hacking 
		Zone&quot; which was dedicated to reverse engineering the game.&nbsp; I created 
		forums to bring together those interested in learning more about how the 
		game worked, I expanded on the work of David Simpson to create tools 
		like PortalCracker, BmpSwap, and ACCOM, and I decoded much of the 
		client-server network communication.&nbsp; Asheron's Call was exactly the 
		sort of technology that I had always wanted to work on.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn't an easy decision to leave a 
		company like Microsoft to go work for a small game company that had an 
		unclear future, but I couldn't overcome the desires that Richard 
		Garriott had firmly embedded into my mind when I was but a young child.&nbsp; 
		Perhaps if not for a single networking bug I would be a former UO2 or 
		Ultima X: Odyssey team member, but fate has treated me kindly.&nbsp; I work 
		at Turbine.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your favorite quest in 
			Asheron's Call and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'd have to say Aerlinthe before the 
		three hour timer.&nbsp; It was a challenging and involved quest which you'd 
		have to do many times before it was your turn to get the big reward.&nbsp; I 
		was low enough level that I would most certainly die from a single 
		mistake.&nbsp; I was normally 30 to 60 levels lower than the other people in 
		the group which, back then, meant we couldn't use a fellowship.&nbsp; The 
		typical result was that the mages vuln'd everything in sight and my 
		archer got all the XP, not a bad arrangement when you can manage it 
		without upsetting the other people on the quest.&nbsp; That made it all the 
		more rewarding when my level 1 mule got to wear the black robe.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your least favorite monster 
			and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I hate all elementals.&nbsp; Anyone who played 
		during the elemental invasion understands why.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Where did you get your nickname?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I tend not to use nicknames.&nbsp; I dislike 
		anonymity for philosophical reasons; all it takes is a veil of anonymity 
		to turn some otherwise intelligent human beings into a ravenous 
		slobbering trolls.&nbsp; There is no civilization without individual 
		identity.&nbsp; The Internet is largely a proof that Plato was right when he 
		wrote the Ring of Gyges.</font><br>
