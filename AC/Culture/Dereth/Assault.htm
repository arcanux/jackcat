	January 7, 2005</span></font></small><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tirenia 
	shoved her blade into the Shadow's throat and watched as its corpse fell to 
	the floor. She had no time to savor her victory. The cloaked ones were upon 
	her.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Soldiers of Dereth! To me!&quot; she cried. The 
	Queen's Royal Guard, scattered and battered by the sudden attack, converged 
	on Tirenia. They wore a patchwork of armor and cloak. Many had been asleep 
	when the Vault had been breached. None of them had ever expected an attack 
	in this most secret of locations. Now they paid the price for that 
	arrogance.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The creatures swarmed through the portal. 
	Virindi, Drudges, and Shadows clawed their way forward, slicing through her 
	soldiers with fearsome savagery. Her men screamed and died. Surely, they 
	were being resurrected at the Queen's palace. The Queen must know of the 
	assault. Surely, reinforcements were on the way.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Fall back! To the warehouse!&quot; Tirenia's men 
	turned and ran. She decapitated a Drudge who had the bad sense to turn his 
	back to her, then followed after.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But her retreat did not last long. A great 
	boom sounded behind her. An explosion of some sort flung her to the ground. 
	She lost her grip on her sword, and it clanged away across the stone floor.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tirenia turned and looked back at the portal. 
	Something else had just arrived. Something large. She could scarcely believe 
	her eyes. What new alliance was this?</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The creature reared back, and threw.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tirenia tried to crawl out of the way, but 
	she was simply too slow. The massive boulder dashed her brains across the 
	Vault floor.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cyphis Suldow stepped out of portal space and 
	entered the chilly, northern town. He had tried his best to clear the spot 
	of its filthy inhabitants, but he simply was not the warrior he wished he 
	was. He had often attempted the path of the blade, but had always met with 
	failure. His mother had told him many times that he would amount to nothing 
	in his life, and thus far he had proved her correct.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But the time to show that damnable woman just 
	what sort of man he was drew nigh. He had a plan. A grand, glorious plan. 
	And if he wasn't strong enough to carry it out, then by Pwyll he would find 
	someone who was.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Acid and bile seared his flesh. The screams 
	of the beasts assaulted his ears. The stench of fear hung from his fetid 
	form like a shroud.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He clawed his way past a pile of chitinous 
	corpses with scarred, bloodied hands. The monsters raged behind him, a clash 
	of beasts more fearsome than any he had dared imagine on Ispar. Their 
	attentions were focused on each other for now. They did not notice one 
	frightened man in his desperate bid for escape.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He had hidden in these tunnels for months. 
	Fleeing from the Knights. Fleeing from the beasts. But they had found him. 
	They had tried to kill him. Luckily, the insects had intervened.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He used the battle to his advantage. He ran. 
	He dug. He hid.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It had been so long. So many months beneath 
	the earth. So many months of blood and bile. He did not remember the sun. He 
	did not remember his home. He barely remembered his name. All he did 
	remember was her face. That face which he would never see again.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Carlo clawed past the corpses. A wall of 
	green, hardened ooze plugged the hallway ahead of him. He pried it apart, 
	and fled into the dark beyond. Deep within, he spied something he had not 
	seen in months. Something beautiful. Something wonderful</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Loh-Gann Huhjj traversed the sun-baked Dires 
	with his vassal Ghunjara bint Dulsama. The two had been hunting for hours, 
	though they had yet to find one of the weapons Krilian Starstone had told 
	them about earlier that morning. Weapons much deadlier than any they had 
	found in any of their previous hunts. Krilian bragged that he was able to 
	outpace even Loh-Gann's formidable hunting ability with these new weapons.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Loh-Gann did not take kindly to such jests. 
	He prided himself on being the most skilled warrior in his allegiance. He 
	knew other monarchs who were content to merely provide their allegiances 
	with weapons, armor, and spells. But not Loh-Gann. He was a leader. He was 
	the one at the front of the pack in every battle. He was the one with the 
	most notches on his blade. And he would let his vassals call him a lying 
	blue-skin before they could claim to be a better huntsman than he.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Loh-Gann unsheathed his blade and plunged 
	into the Justicar's back before it even knew a threat was upon it. In a 
	matter of moments, the Lugian was dead. Loh-Gann rifled through its pack and 
	tossed aside the usual assortment of jewelry and worthless armor.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Doesn't look like there's anything there,&quot; 
	Ghunjara said bitterly.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Loh-Gann picked a tattered leather coat out 
	of the creature's pack and flung it over his shoulder. He turned to leave, 
	but a glint caught his eye.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There, beneath the scattered remains of the 
	Lugian's inventory, gleamed a bright, silver blade.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Loh-Gann smiled.</font></p>

	these three towns to cast more useful spells. You can now pay to have them

	for low-level players who can't cast these spells on their own and may be 
	uncomfortable using a player-run buff bot. </font></p>

	<font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to the January Letter to the Players! A 
	new year is dawning, both in Dereth and in the real world, and we're 
	thrilled to have you with us for it. We hope that you've all had a healthy 
	and happy holidays and that you're ready for 2005! This year will bring the 
	completion of our ongoing migration of billing accounts away from Microsoft 
	as well as the next expansion pack: <i>Throne of Destiny</i>, and we're very 
	excited about both.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">On a more somber note, we would like to pass 
	on our condolences to all those who were affected by the tsunami disaster in 
	the Indian Ocean. We encourage all who can to give to the charitable 
	organization of their choice in order to help with aid to the region.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last month in Dereth, a sigh of relief was 
	breathed as the Burun threat came to a halt. The Council was able to 
	continue its work in renovating several towns, focusing on Holtburg, Shoushi 
	and Yaraq. Lugians crafted new forges in these towns to enhance the 
	abilities of crafters and salvagers. As soft snow fell on Dereth, Isparians 
	went ahead with their delayed festival celebrations, crafting new whimsical 
	masks and costumes for amusement.</font></p>

		<b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are items that we plan to implement 
	in the January event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior articles. 
	These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that 
	we'll be introducing in the January event.)</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Higher Wield-Req Weapons</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">January will see the introduction of melee 
	and missile weapons with higher wield requirements as well as new war 
	casters with wield requirements. For more information on this please see the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=335">
	article</a> on this topic.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Withered Creatures</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For some time now we've been discussing the 
	issue of Life Magic at the highest levels of hunting. Many players of melee 
	or missile characters that do not have Life Magic are disappointed by the 
	ability of their characters to advance in the Valley of Death or Singularity 
	Caul. They feel that without a mage assisting them by Imperiling their 
	targets, their ability to kill creatures and earn XP at an acceptable rate 
	is reduced.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For January, we are introducing a new option 
	for these characters – Withered Creatures. A small area in the Direlands has 
	been repopulated with creatures that are completely invulnerable to 
	non-projectile magic, but have lower stats than typical VoD and Caul 
	creatures. You can think of them as &quot;pre-Imperiled&quot;. Some of their other 
	stats may be &quot;pre-debuffed&quot; as well. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is not expected that all players will find 
	this to be a perfect solution to the Life Magic balance issues at high 
	levels. However many players of characters without Life Magic should find 
	this to be a viable alternative to their existing hunting options. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You'll note that this went straight from <b>
	In Concept </b>to <b>Coming Soon</b>. We felt that this was a large enough 
	issue that it should be put on a development fast track.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Hookable Portals</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the January event, the number of portal 
	devices that can be hooked on mansions will be increased to 7. We are 
	looking at the possibility of removing the limit altogether in February, 
	although these will still be mansion-only items, although this may not be 
	feasible due to technical restrictions.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Carved Mosswart Statue is being moved 
	into a new group of mansion-only items. This group will initially have a 
	limit of two items per mansion. If you currently have a Carved Mosswart 
	Statue hooked on your mansion, it will continue to be counted towards the 
	portal devices group unless you remove it and re-hook it after the January 
	event.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Western Forge Essence Rewards</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to a bug, Urleg did not provide an 
	appropriate reward to level 126 characters who handed in a Western Forge 
	Essence. We wanted to ensure that these characters did not get completely 
	shut out of this one-time award, so during the January event Arcanum Agents 
	will be providing an appropriate XP award to level 126 characters who hand 
	them a Western Forge Essence. Like Urleg's award, this is one-time only. 
	Characters who already handed in an Essence to Urleg can acquire a new 
	Essence once their 30 day timer expires. Again, this award is only for level 
	126 characters.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Bug Fixes: Phantom Atlatl and Noble Armor</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We've already mentioned these fixes on the 
	official forums, but we wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of these 
	as they have been fairly high-profile bugs. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting in January, any worn Noble Armor 
	that still has the Greater Hieromancer's Ward cast on it will have that 
	enchantment removed upon first login. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also in January, the damage mod on the 
	Phantom Atlatl will be reduced from its currently bugged +40% to the 
	intended -60%. </font></p>

		<b><font face="Arial">In Development</font></b></div>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we are 
	working on for the February event. None of these items are guaranteed to be 
	added for February as scheduling and priorities can change. These changes 
	are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that we'll be 
	introducing in the January event. Your feedback on these topics is 
	particularly valuable.)</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Social Centers Buy Caps</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we continue our work to make Holtburg, 
	Shoushi and Yaraq into more inviting towns for characters of all levels, we 
	are increasing the buy caps on the vendors in these towns. All vendors in 
	these three towns will buy items up to 1,000,000 pyreals in value starting 
	in February.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Darktide-Only Dungeons</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In recognition of the substantially different 
	play environment of Darktide, in February we will be implementing a set of 
	tiered dungeons focused on providing more exciting PvP combat and quicker 
	advancement. These dungeons will have content in them that can earn a 
	character a great deal of experience – so long as the character isn't killed 
	during the process!</font></p>

	2005<b><br>
&nbsp;</b></font></span></span></small><div class="bodyTextMedium">
		<font size="2" face="Arial">As we wrote in the December Letter to the 
		Players, January brings with it the implementation of something we've 
		been working on for several months now – higher wield-req weapons.</font><div class="headlineMedium">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">What Do They Do?</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Currently the best melee weapons that a 
		player can find are those with a 325 base skill wield requirement. 
		Likewise, missile weapons go up to 290 base skill wield requirements. 
		War mages currently have no wield-requirement casters, relying solely on 
		the strength of their spells in order to deal more damage.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the introduction of wield-req 
		weapons, we've introduced bigger and tougher creatures, and players have 
		advanced to higher and higher levels of skill. But there's been no new 
		equipment to strive for beyond the existing limits, and little for war 
		mages to look for once they have gained the ability to cast level 7 
		spells.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In January, all this changes. We will be 
		introducing a new tier of 350 wield-req melee weapons, 315 wield-req 
		missile weapons, and two tiers of war casters at 290 and 310 wield-reqs.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The melee weapons are straightforward – 
		the higher the wield-req, the higher the max damage on the loot weapon.
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The missile weapons have a twist to them 
		– 315 wield-req missile weapons will receive a bonus to a specific 
		elemental type. For example you might find a 315 wield-req bow that has 
		a damage modifier of 127% as well as a +2 to fire damage. Whenever fire 
		arrows are used with this bow, it will do an additional 2 points of 
		damage to the target. (And no, +2 is not the best that you can find!)</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The casters also gain damage bonuses. The 
		290 and 310 war magic wield-req casters will be found with a bonus to 
		damage done by a specific element. In the case of casters, the damage 
		bonus is a small % of damage done rather than a flat damage increase. 
		This bonus applies to any spell of the matching damage type, even the 
		inherent spell on the caster. For instance, a 310 wield-req caster might 
		have a bonus of 3% on slashing spells. The bonus on casters with a 310 
		skill requirement is higher than that on casters with a 290 skill 
		requirement. The 290 wield-req casters are comparable to the existing 
		325 melee and 290 missile weapons.</font></p>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Overall, these new weapons are 
		expected to improve damage over time at high levels by around 5%.</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">How Do I Get One?</font></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These new weapons will be loot-generated 
		and found at the highest tiers of treasure, those tiers intended for 
		players at levels 80 and above. The exception is the 290 wield-req 
		casters, which will begin to be found in the tier intended for players 
		at levels 60 to 80. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<font size="2" face="Arial">What About...?</font></div>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">...PvP! Won't these new 
			casters be overpowering? </font></b><font size="2">The elemental 
			damage bonus for casters is reduced when these weapons are used 
			against other players. The effectiveness against both creatures and 
			players can be seen when you ID the caster. Note that the elemental 
			damage bonus on missile weapons is <i>not</i> reduced in PvP combat, 
			as the bonus on missile weapons is flat and not a percentage. </font>
			</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">...Wield-Req casters for 
			magic schools other than War? </font></b><font size="2">There aren't 
			any plans for these at this time. </font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">...Life magic bolts?</font></b><font size="2"> 
			For now, the wield req casters can only generate with the 7 normal 
			damage types, so they do not have any effect on life bolt spells.
			</font></font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">...Even higher wield-req 
			weapons? </font></b><font size="2">Coming in the future!</font></font></li>
