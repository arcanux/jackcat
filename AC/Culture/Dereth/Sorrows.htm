      </font><img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="112" height="250"><font face="Arial" size="2">Balle was rich. Unbelievably rich. While in Samsur he had acquired Dranal's carving tool to crack open the Mnemosynes, but the tool apparently had far more uses than its maker knew.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      He found the key discarded on the ground near a known Virindi war camp by the Obsidian Plains. A spoil of battle either unseen or unwanted, and Balle happily slipped it into his pocket. It was only later that night that he took out the strange artifact, the twisted rings dimly glowing purple, and thought he saw in its alien outline the makings of a key. He took out his carving knife.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      And then the following morning, while traveling along the eastern shore to the north of Wai Jhou, he came across the floating Trove.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Balle now made his way to Tufa, after trading and selling the contents of the Trove in Ayan Baqur. All those rumors of travelers being slaughtered on the outskirts of town actually helped his profits. When people were scared, they became foolish.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      His mind still spinning at the value of what he'd found in the Trove, Balle didn't notice the glowing shapes floating softly toward him. Even had he looked up, he would not have known what a Doll was. Later, the echoes of his screams still carried far over the deserted sands.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Unlike any other gaming experience, the world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. Last month, winter kept its icy grip about the land; yet along with the snow and cold came new Item Magic spells, pack toys, and the loot of vanguard leaders. One can only wonder what additions -- and what dangers -- will be added when we open our March event, “Spring's Sorrows.”<br>
      <br>
      Be sure to continue your part in this incredible ongoing story, and we'll see you in Dereth!&nbsp;

      </font><img src="Sorrows/pic_lockpick2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="120"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first month of springtime has come at last, marking the launch of our “Spring's Sorrows” event! The Hopeslayer has fallen and, as with the former winter snows, the Undead wane in strength and power. Even the Shadows, once dire invaders of the land, no longer bother to curse those adventurers who slay them. Yet despite all sense of victory, a suspicious pallor still haunts the season.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For into this scene moves a new enemy.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Virindi have been encountered, in forces never before met in such aggression. This month marks the arrival of the Virindi Executor, as well as two entirely new creatures added to Dereth's already full and deadly bestiary: Dolls and Marionettes, both corrupt results of Virindi experiments gone fantastically awry.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      However, far more has entered the world this month than mere Virindi-induced calamity. For those skilled in the lockpicking arts, strange puzzles present themselves. The solutions? Whether in the Virindis' carried keys or the Mnemosyne pyramids remains to be seen. For those of a more scholarly bent, archaeologists are said to be searching out inspiring Undead lore. And, for collectors and hunters, new springtime trophies can be gained, able to be crafted into unique and useful items. At least, such has been rumored by certain poachers, themselves bedecked in cured trophies of the land.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Truly, Dereth has awoken from its winter hibernation. And whatever forces have been set in motion this spring, surely the Virindi control the strings. The ultimate goal of these floating puppet masters? A force of mystery, as of yet unknown.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Following is a list of the most interesting additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.&nbsp;</font></p>

      </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed the problem of cycling through items 
      on the ground using the keyboard. Before, if two or more items were the 
      same distance from a player, only one would be selected and the rest would 
      be ignored. Now all items are cycled through. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shadow Children no longer cast portals to 
      Savao upon death. This should have been changed when the rest of the Shard 
      of the Herald quest was removed, but was overlooked. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Increased the drop rates of Vial Organic 
      Acid for Bane, Harrower, and Virulent Grievvers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Blunt daggers are no longer able to be 
      enchanted. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Replaced a door with static artwork to 
      eliminate a shortcut in the Hieromancer Halls. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aerlinthe Smithing Golem no longer 
      broadcasts global messages that the volcanoes are active. This was cueing 
      the Behemoth of Tenkarrdun quest spawn jumpers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Changed the level of Relic Bones Portal 
      (“the Watchman”) to match the other Relic Bones. Now he is an individual, 
      like all his other friends. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Updated Aerfalle's Keep with the new 
      anti-macro design. All creatures in the dungeon, except for the Hellfires 
      and Lag Beasts, are now on event generators. The death of the Watchman 
      will activate the spawn. The death of Aerfalle *OR* the passage of ninety 
      minutes will turn off all generators and empty the dungeon again. You 
      can't macro drain what isn't there. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are now powerful Mana Drain hotspots 
      in Aerfalle's Keep exit portal room. Do not enter this area unless you 
      intend to leave. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The cells in lower Aerfalle's Keep have 
      been changed. Increased the spawn rate of the Umbris from ten to twelve 
      minutes. The big, peaceful Panumbris next door has been removed. Its room 
      is now filled with Mana Drain hotspots. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed many Mana Blight and Dispel traps 
      in the final hallway of Aerfalle's Keep. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aerfalle's Key is now a no-drop item.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lady Aerfalle cracked open some of her 
      dusty old grimoires and learned new spells. Expect painful but brief (one 
      to five minute) debuffs. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Changed the damage values of Singularity 
      weapons. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Guardian and Nephol Golems at the 
      Thaumaturgic Plate Lyceum were made, despite lore and intentions to the 
      contrary, drainable. Bad. Fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lowered the max mana of all Thaumaturgic 
      and Exarch Plate pieces to 2000, and reduced the burn rates to one point 
      per eight seconds. This gives the pieces the same 4.4 hour endurance as 
      before, but at 1/4 the mana charge cost. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lowered the value of all Thaumaturgic and 
      Exarch Plate pieces by 20% (coat: 8000, leggings: 4800, girth: 2400).
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lowered encumbrance on both Thaumaturgic 
      and Exarch Plate pieces to make a full set nearly as lightweight as a robe 
      (coat: 100, leggings: 75, girth: 50). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">On the Exarch Plate Girth, replaced Fauna 
      Perlustration with Mana Renewal 6. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Thaumaturgic and Exarch Plate Coats 
      have been extended to cover the hands. That's one less armor piece 
      (gloves/gauntlets) to buff. <br>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The huntress Dyanne paused at the edge of 
    the twisted woods overlooking MacDugal's Castle, the sole of one boot 
    sinking into fresh springtime mud. Almost overnight, it seemed, Dereth had 
    shaken off its winter coat. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>A warmer, brighter sun arose one morning, all 
    but entirely melting the snows away. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Silvery crowns still graced the 
    loftiest mountain peaks, but here below them the tender shoots of young 
    grass and clover began to color the seas of mud. <br>
    <br>
    One advantage of the softer ground Dyanne noted, with no small satisfaction, 
    was the improved quality of animal tracks.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;Hunting was proving easy, for 
    once. In fact, she thought, one corner of her mouth twisting wryly, it was 
    easy enough that any novice could stalk the creatures she had been hunting 
    without competition for many months. <br>
    <br>
    If only the Virindi left tracks. The huntress cast a cautious eye about 
    herself, checking for the bizarre floating entities. The latest rumor held 
    that Virindi were edging ever closer to certain human settlements. Although 
    there were no reports of Virindi appearing in northern Osteth, it was best 
    to be careful. <br>
    <br>
    Dyanne hoisted her pack to a more comfortable position, and started down 
    toward MacDugal's holding. It was a heavy load, filled with the first pelts 
    and skins of the season. Her contact, the poacher Gillian, had promised to 
    take a look at her gathered trophies, perhaps to craft them into useful 
    items. Dyanne had never bothered with Sclavus hide before, but if anyone 
    could work the stuff into something of value, it was Gillian.</p>

    spotted, but few observers have survived to tell the tale. In fact, several

    course, those not adept at picking locks can still use less subtle skills to 
    reap their own rewards. Sclavus, like the serpents they descend from, have 
    begun to shed their skin. Of course, the fall of a warrior's axe can always 
    hurry this process along. Sclavus hides, as well as those trophies from 
    Ursuin and other creatures, can reportedly be crafted into boots and other 
    fine items.</font> </p>

    STORY SO FAR</a></b><span class="head1" style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br>
    &quot;A herald burned across the southern 
    sky one morning; a fiery drop, like the Watcher that visits Auberean every 
    few hundred years, yet moving far more quickly. Shortly after this sign, a 
    veil drew over the sun. Rain fell, and the drops were black and cold. The 
    trees and grasses withered. The clouds built until noon was mere twilight, 
    and the wind blew as cold as stone in winter. The people wanted for their 
    crops and herds. Some called it the end. Some said it was the judgment of 
    light, and that evils must be atoned for.&quot;&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P>

    Penned by Asheron Realaidain himself, this piece chronicles the entire
