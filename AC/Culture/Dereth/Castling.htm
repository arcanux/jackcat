      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">June 10</span>, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Elysa Strathelar knew she was dreaming. She struggled 
    against the invisible tendrils that held her, and that felt real enough. 
    Panic and anger surged within her as she fought, twisting and snarling. . . 
    but it was obviously a dream. A figure stood just outside of the corner of 
    her eye, enough so that she knew he was there, could not see him directly. 
    He seemed to flicker, there, not there, there, not there. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">And she was floating, hovering above her bed. She could 
    not turn her head, which was bound like the rest of her body, but she was 
    several paces from her vaulted stone ceiling, and she could see the torch 
    flames on the wall lapping up the warm night air as soft breezes blew in 
    through the open tower windows. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In a back corner of her mind, behind the rage 
    and fear as she fought against her unseen tormentor, she wondered what the 
    dream meant. Yet another example of the icy rage she felt toward Martine? 
    Her continued attempts to deal with the shock of almost losing her son? Her 
    previous resentment towards Asheron, as she had had to cope with these 
    problems alone? All of these, perhaps.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was mumbling. She could hear the tones, 
    but the words were hard to make out, and Elysa could not turn her head to 
    catch the sound. Eventually, she heard two voices. One was low and deep, 
    with an almost keening quality. The other was high and tinny; hollow tones 
    encased in dank metal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">How unusual to have such lucidity during a 
    dream, she thought. There was none of the usual muddled slew of images 
    barely connected to one another. No, there was only the struggling and 
    resistance. The anger and the fear. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The voices were closer now. “Elysa. . .” This 
    was the low voice, and the stark need in it made her wonder what hell the 
    person uttering her name had gone through. Twenty years in Dereth had made 
    her intimate with pain, and she recognized immediately the sound of someone 
    similarly seared. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She stopped struggling. She wanted to comfort 
    the man, reassure him. As she ceased struggling, she felt her body slowly 
    lower back towards the bed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This time the voice was right behind her 
    head. “Elysa, I. . .” and she felt a hand touch her, stroke the sides of her 
    hair. It felt warm and wet, and glistened red at the edge of her vision. 
    This was not a dream. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elysa convulsed, disbelief warring with the 
    worst fear she had ever known. The voice continued, “I know I have said, and 
    done, horrible things, Elysa. But here, hidden away in stone and shadow, 
    there is no wider audience. There is only you and me. And so, so much to 
    talk about.” Acid bile rose from her stomach, making her gag with the 
    vileness of it, of him. This was not a dream. She tried to break free from 
    his magical bonds, she tried to scream. Nothing. She could not move. This 
    was not a dream. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What was it, Elysa, that first drew me to 
    you? In the beginning, I admit, there were certain opaque intentions and 
    manipulations in regards to your Empyrean advisor. I wanted him dead, I 
    needed him dead. You were, at first, a tool. One of many at my disposal, I 
    thought.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“Warning. Proximity. . .”</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Silence!” There had been that tinnying voice 
    before Martine had cut it off. It came from her side as well. Someone else? 
    Elysa struggled to control her fear. She tried to draw strength from her one 
    consolation. . . Borelean was not here. She had sent him away with Asheron 
    to a safer, less public place, after the first reports had trickled in of 
    Martine's appearances throughout Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Her son was safe. Now all she needed was for 
    Martine to. . . he brought up his deformed claw against the side of her face 
    and pressed it there. She could feel its warmth. It throbbed. All thought 
    left her mind as Elysa screamed silently. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes, my darling. I understand that emotion 
    well. You have known pain. Such exquisite pain. And that was why I marked 
    you. You had lost, as I had lost. You had grieved, as I had grieved. I had 
    thought that you should lose a child, as I had lost a child. . . but that is 
    behind us now. We will raise Borelean together, as man and wife. We will 
    rule Dereth as King and Queen. Dereth and beyond. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Tonight is when I claim you, Elysa. We shall 
    be married. We shall be in love. No one will stand in our way. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“Warning. . .”</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The heavy oak door leading to Elysa's 
    bedchamber exploded inward. The invisible bonds holding Elysa up immediately 
    disappeared. As she fell back she glanced to her side. Surrounded by a blue 
    nimbus, his eyes flashing scarlet, Asheron stood in the doorway. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally. Martine had waited for this moment 
    for such a long time. And now everything was at hand. His bride-to-be at his 
    side. His nemesis in front of him. A corpse-to-be. Martine raised his hands 
    sending a coruscating stream of flame at Asheron. An appetizer for the 
    banquet to follow. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He saw Elysa fall and land on the bed. She 
    reached under the pillow and hurled something at him. A throwing knife, 
    flipping end over end, the light of the flame shining off its metal blade. 
    Asheron had warded off the fire and bolts of acid and frost were now 
    speeding back toward Martine. His heart warmed to see what a little lioness 
    Elysa was. Lovely. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He snatched the knife out of the air and 
    tucked it behind his back. It could be a memento to show their children. The 
    acid stream and frost bolts he let through. As his surface flesh crackled 
    and burned, he wanted to show Asheron the type of pain he should expect. He 
    looked Asheron in the eye and smiled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On each side of the splintered door, stone 
    blocks ripped apart as two of Asheron's Diamond Golems thundered into the 
    room. They towered over everything, animated man-shapes of diamond, 
    Asheron's special creations, representing over a millennia of Empyrean 
    demiurgic research. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They stood motionless as Asheron stepped 
    forward. Elysa had scampered out of sight, but Martine would have time to 
    finish their date later. Asheron was here. Martine giggled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Martine, you must stop this madness. We, all 
    of us, are in grave danger. . . we need. . .” Asheron spoke with the 
    tremulousness of an old man. Even the halo of color that surrounded him, a 
    mark of Empyrean power, flickered occasionally, revealing him to be nothing 
    more than the tired, pathetic husk he was. It almost seemed unworthy for 
    this man to have earned so much of Martine's hate. But Martine wanted this 
    play finished. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“We need what? We need nothing, fool. You 
    warn me of sycophants and mice. No one will oppose me. No one can. You are 
    old and tired. I have come to give you the gift of permanent rest, Weyrava. 
    It is far more than you deserve, but today is my wedding day and I am in a 
    generous mood.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine moved forward as the Diamond Golems 
    stepped in front of Asheron. His first spell took the head off of one of 
    them. Its form continued to lumber about and swing at Martine. The second 
    one landed a clean blow to the side of Martine's body that drove him against 
    the far wall. Martine floated himself up as the ribs on his right side began 
    to reform. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Asheron pressed the attack, bolt after bolt 
    of eldritch might slamming into Martine. Martine took each blow, letting the 
    pain of each ravaging attack strengthen his resolve. Enough. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine teleported quickly behind the last 
    remaining Golem, the first one having succumbed to its beheading, and 
    plunged his hands through the magical bonds that kept it animated. The Golem 
    blew up, spraying shards of diamond throughout the room. Martine shielded 
    himself from the explosion and saw Asheron do the same. He couldn't see 
    Elysa, but he could always repair her later. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">No more words came from Asheron, his focus 
    stayed completely on spewing magical energies at the approaching Martine. 
    There were no more Golems, however. No more saviors and no more tricks. 
    Asheron was his. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the arrow entered the back of his neck and 
    through his throat, Martine gurgled, a short gasp of air and blood. The 
    sharp metal point of the arrow glistened and dripped red beneath his head. 
    He turned, almost stumbling, to see Elysa behind him, her bow already nocked 
    with another arrow and firing. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Elysa,” he tried to say, although his vocal 
    cords were still not quite working. Even as he disintegrated the approaching 
    arrow and sent a shockwave knocking Elysa hard against the stone wall, he 
    wanted her to know he still loved her. She crumpled down to the floor. 
    Asheron leapt by Martine to come to her side, but Martine grabbed him as he 
    passed and flung him to the ground. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine held Asheron there in the same bonds 
    he had held his bride with, as he took the arrow and passed it through his 
    throat, healing the ripping and tearing as it occurred. A few dry gasps, and 
    he was ready. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“How does it feel, little Empyrean, to be in 
    the presence of a superior. For so long you have hid behind your powers, 
    your “benevolent” attitude toward the Isparians hiding the contempt that 
    you, that every one of you, feel toward my former “lesser” race. Shake your 
    head all you wish. We know the truth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“But I promise you this, Asheron Realaidain. 
    I will watch and protect these people better than you ever did. Yes, there 
    will be pain. There will be sacrifice. Greatness requires it. But they will 
    love me. I will love them. If you ever cared for any of the Isparians at 
    all, let that be your final consolation.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine's hand glowed with purple sparks as 
    he raised it for the killing blow. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Asheron looked up at Martine and prepared 
    himself for one final strike. It was possible that Martine would focus all 
    of his energies to kill him, leaving Asheron free to cast his own last 
    spell. Asheron had little hope of killing Martine, but any blow might help<i>. 
    I am sorry, Elysa. I am sorry, Martine. I failed you, both.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine's blow did not fall. Asheron saw 
    Martine's mask ripple, and the black holes of his eyes filled with a 
    purplish glow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“Please. It hurts very much to do 
    this. He is fighting me very hard. He is not. . . happy.”</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Though the speaker did not speak with the 
    usual syntax of his race, Asheron recognized the high, metallic tones of the 
    Virindi. Had the Virindi side of Martine finally broken through? And did 
    that improve the situation? He struggled to speak, but the bonds continued 
    to hold him in place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“No. No time to release you. You 
    must listen to me. I have died once already. It's important that you 
    understand that. They had fused the human and my. . . self together. This 
    had never been done before. But they did it, and the human killed me. 
    Complete assimilation. There was no self. There was only Martine.”</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Asheron had not realized the depths of the 
    Virindi experiments upon Martine. He had had suspicions. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“But he brought me back. Do you see? 
    I did not exist, and he recreated me. I am not Virindi. I am a part of him 
    that he made into Virindi. Please understand. Even then, so long ago, he did 
    not trust. He knows. He does not want to know, but he knows.”</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Virindi screamed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><font size="2">“He is going to kill me again. He 
    cannot stand betrayal. But I knew that you must not die now. Martine knows. 
    Please. I. . . I am losing hold. My death did not hurt this much the first 
    time. Leave. Take the woman and leave now. Remember that Martine 
    understands! Leave!”</font></i><font size="2"> </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Asheron was free once more. He spared one 
    final glance for Martine's body, wracked by pain and struggle, and heard the 
    final, anguished screams of the tortured Virindi. He gathered up Elysa, 
    unconscious but still breathing, and began to portal them both out of the 
    chamber. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Martine looked up at their disappearing forms 
    and screamed. Asheron felt Elysa's tower coming apart as Martine let loose 
    with his destructive power. And then there was shadow and silence. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was time to begin the final plan.</font></p>

    Roll Out Article</b> - </span>From 
    the 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEeventrollout.asp">Zone</a></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">June 13</span>, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Any comfort brought to the people by the 
    victories against the Bronze Statues and their new weapons was shattered by 
    the assault on their Queen and the destruction of her castle by the insane 
    Martine. Just barely escaping the destruction with her and her son's lives, 
    Queen Elysa begins taking steps, with the aid of Asheron, to truly make 
    Dereth her people's homeland. The last Empyrean has been of great assistance 
    of late to the people of Dereth and has some wondering if he can indeed be 
    trusted as the Queen has always maintained. Martine's rage at having the 
    Queen snatched from his grasp has not been satiated by the mere destruction 
    of her castle, and he continues to formulate plans, breathing hate for 
    Asheron. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still reeling from this attack, the people 
    were dealt another blow when mages were jolted awake in the dark of night, 
    clutching their heads in pain. Throughout the ley lines of magical force 
    deep in the planet, a vast fluctuation was felt. Reports trickled in that 
    the magical Essences, those forces that aided the people in learning higher 
    magics, were destroyed, and the rings where they stood smashed. To their 
    dismay, the recovered mages discovered that their magics were not as 
    powerful as they had once been. They were able, though, to take some solace 
    in the fact that this fluctuation caused their magics to last much longer 
    than they had previously. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Realizing what a blow this was to the 
    Isparians, Asheron shared knowledge on how to create magical foci with the 
    Arcanum. These bulky packs contained the essence of the magical schools 
    known to the Isparians. With these in hand, along with Prismatic Tapers and 
    Scarabs, Isparians could cast their spells without the other components they 
    had used since their arrival on Dereth. Asheron also shared a means to 
    record scrolls so that all those skilled in the various schools could 
    understand them, not just lore scholars. Scriveners quickly set up shop in 
    the various towns selling scrolls for purchase. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amidst these events, the exploration of 
    Dereth continues. Rumors return of an ancient Empyrean construct unlike any 
    seen before, containing artifacts of an unknown purpose. Parties have begun 
    gathering to find this construct and pull what secrets they can from it.

      addition, monarchs may now assign speaker status to someone even if they 
      are not currently online. </font></li>

      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Pyreals now stack to a maximum of 10,000. 
      In July we will introduce three additional trade notes into the game.
      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Mansions now have 100 hooks in them, all 
      of them usable. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Neutral Balm's burden has been reduced 
      from 135 to 65 and is now available in more vendor locations. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Select Self key now works to have a 
      targeted action actually work on oneself. For example, a player can use a 
      healing kit and then the Select Self key to heal oneself. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You now have a number of UI panels and 
      character options that you can bind to a keyboard map. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">A new mana stone, the Superb Mana Stone, 
      can be found at some mage vendors. In addition, many more mage vendors now 
      carry High and Great Mana Stones. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">All Bronze trophy items are now givable 
      and droppable again. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">New characters who start with a magic 
      school will start with the correct focus, 5 Lead Scarabs, and 25 Prismatic 
      Tapers. New characters who start with additional magic schools will 
      receive additional foci, but not additional scarabs or tapers. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The time it takes to read and learn a 
      spell from a scroll has been reduced to roughly one second. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">When a character attempts to use a mana 
      stone to drain mana from an item, there will now be a confirmation check 
      even if the item does not contain any mana. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Isparian Bows, Crossbows, and Atlatls are 
      now unenchantable. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Isparian Modifying Tool is now 
      unbreakable. The stones, however, will break each time you put them in an 
      Isparian weapon. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Arcane Lore difficulty on Gorgets with 
      Nuhmudira's Boon has been altered. The new difficulty levels are Red 
      (High) = 180, Blue (Mid) = 150, and Green (Low) = 120. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Isparian Daggers now have the correct 
      damage range. Perfect Isparian Daggers have a maximum damage of 8, Superb 
      7, Good 6, and Quality 5. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You now get 3 Wood, Copper, or Obsidian 
      Keys when you successfully carve Wood, Copper, or Obsidian Hearts. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We made a few changes to the Tenkkardun 
      Foundry to reduce the viability of combat macroing in that location.
      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Last month we introduced a bug which 
      prevented users from playing if they were using a machine running Win95a. 
      This should be fixed now. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We believe we have fixed the bug where, 
      occasionally, a character logging into the world would find that their 
      items had lost all mana. This was a difficult bug to reproduce, and we 
      would appreciate any reports if players experience this bug in the future.
      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a bug with the Fellowship panel 
      last month that kept it from updating properly. This should be fixed now.
      </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The bug where a character quits a 
      fellowship and the character keeps attempting to assess a person in the 
      fellowship has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">We fixed a bug where the cursor appeared 
      as an hourglass on the Fellowship panel before a player actually created 
      the fellowship. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There were a few bugs with the XP-sharing 
      code for certain fellowships involving players over level 50. These have 
      been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a bug where you could exploit a 
      vendor by selling healing kits with less than full uses, then buying them 
      back cheaply at full uses. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">For Creature Mastery scrolls, you will 
      need to ID and read the description to determine if it's a Self or Other 
      scroll. Self and Other do not appear in the title of the scroll. This will 
      be fixed in July. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></span></p>

      Facility now has a level restriction prohibiting those characters under

    <p><span class="Head"><b>Why Now? </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    <i>Castling</i>, our June Event, marks what may be the most significant 
    change ever made in the history of <i>Asheron's Call</i>--the complete 
    revamping of how players learn and cast magical spells in Dereth. We did not 
    approach this change lightly; indeed, it was the subject of many intense 
    conversations! Those hours of discussion and argument ensured that the 
    changes we finally agreed upon all served our goal: to make <i>Asheron's 
    Call </i>as fun and compelling for as wide an audience as possible. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many people have asked us, “Why now?” After 
    two and a half years of relatively few game system changes, why would 
    Turbine and Microsoft embark upon a path of such major changes? Our 
    determination to make these changes ultimately has to do with our desire to 
    see <i>Asheron's Call </i>thrive for a long time to come. Each major change 
    that we make comes from our strong belief that the specific change will 
    enhance the fun of the game for the vast majority of our players. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We could have decided to play it safe and 
    make only a few changes, to introduce small amounts of content designed to 
    placate our existing subscriber base until the ship of <i>Asheron's Call 2</i>, 
    to allow (and so encourage) <i>AC </i>to pass away in time for <i>AC2</i>.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Obviously, we chose a different path. And 
    we're not stopping with this month's magic changes! Next month, in addition 
    to the first stage of the Tinkering system, we will be making significant 
    changes to the Transfer spell system. Transfer spells, such as Drain Health, 
    will be altered substantially in July. (Look for more details to be posted 
    before the July Event). And in the following months, look for continued 
    tweaks to melee weapons, including addressing the Triple-Strike Dagger 
    issue. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, we know that change can be scary and 
    sometimes painful in the short-term, but we also know that change is 
    necessary for long-term growth and happiness. We are striving to make sure 
    that any time we make major changes that reduce an ability of a given class 
    or skill, we also offer new benefits to that class or skill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So why didn't we make some of these changes a 
    year ago? Although it was easy to see, in some cases, that things were not 
    working as well as they should, it was more difficult to come up with 
    solutions that we and the players would be happy with. Over the past eight 
    months, we developed a strong vision and consensus on what problems needed 
    to be addressed and how to address them. You are seeing the fruits of those 
    efforts now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're excited about the world that <i>
    Asheron's Call </i>is coming to represent, and we hope you are, too. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Long live <i>Asheron's Call</i>! </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Housing </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    This month we're releasing another 150 Cottages and 50 Villas. While we are 
    not releasing any Residential Quarters at this time, we are planning to 
    release 500 RQs in July (in addition to more Cottages, Villas, and even new 
    Mansions!). We're putting out 500 RQs instead of 1,000 so that we can better 
    monitor the impact of the RQs on the servers in July. Depending on the data, 
    we will decide how many more RQs will be released in the upcoming months
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also implemented 100 total hooks for 
    Mansions this month, each one of them usable by the monarch owner. There are 
    no plans to revisit hooks for any of the landscape dwellings at this time.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for future housing improvements, the 
    server performance issues related to RQs a few months ago have caused us to 
    shelve our plans for incremental storage, at least temporarily. Once we are 
    assured that the worlds can support enough housing for all our players, we 
    may revisit the idea of allowing players to purchase increased storage for 
    their landscape dwelling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, we are still planning to implement 
    the ability for characters to “use” items on hooks, which would allow a 
    number of neat features, such as the ability to place permanent “portals” in 
    one's home. Look for the start of this feature in the next several months.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Changes </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We're always happy when we can implement 
      new allegiance and fellowship improvements. We hope the <i>@allegiance 
      info </i>tool and the increased uses of the allegiance broadcasts help 
      monarchs manage their allegiances more productively. We're also pleased 
      with the new triangle radar shape for fellowship leaders. After being 
      frustrated for a long time by the inability of a large group to easily 
      follow a leader on the landscape, we hit upon this simple yet effective 
      solution. We hope you enjoy it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We fixed a number of longstanding and 
      irritating bugs this month. Two of the biggest were the “vendors not 
      buying back their own trade notes” and “characters logging back into the 
      world and occasionally discovering that all their items had lost all their 
      mana” problems. Our solution to the vendor issue was to make all vendors 
      able to purchase all trade notes, regardless of what trade notes they 
      sell. As we mentioned in the Dev Notes, the “items losing mana” issue was 
      extremely difficult to track down and reproduce, so please report any 
      instances if you see it happen again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Money, money, money. After analyzing the 
      current state of the pyreal economy and factoring in new changes such as 
      the updated magic system, we decided to increase the stack size of the 
      pyreal to 10,000. We think this change will help improve the liquidity of 
      the pyreal, especially at such a time when the pyreal may have its 
      greatest value. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Superb Mana Stones. One change we wanted 
      to make sure to introduce whenever we implemented the new, extended buff 
      times was a new, high-mana mana stone. The Superb Mana Stone has a 
      reservoir of 2,000 mana, and can be found at many mage shops throughout 
      Dereth. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Hot Topics </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@filter recall </i>command. While we 
      knew that some players would eventually learn to ignore the spammy text 
      messages from the numerous recall options available today, we wanted to 
      give players stronger relief from the incessant barrage should they 
      desire. (As one of our grandfathers always says, “Back in my day, we 
      didn't have all this newfangled `recallin'' all over the dang place. We 
      had to walk back to Serac Vault, in the snow, uphill. Both ways!”) </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bronze weapons. We apologize for not 
      telling people in advance about the sudden change to the Bronze trophies 
      making them no-give. This had been planned as a one-month-only change, and 
      we are glad to change them back to their natural state this month. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hollow Weapons/Racial Weapons. For July, 
      we will be making some minor tweaks to unarmed weapons, staves, and 
      hollows (including some of the racial weapons). While the racial weapons 
      still will not have the effectiveness of their non-racial counterparts, or 
      of the current Triple-Strike Dagger, they will receive some bonuses. It 
      remains true that the four non-racial weapons, sword, axe, mace, and 
      spear, should be considered the “better” class of weapons in the game. 
      However, we do recognize that the current state of non-dagger racials 
      needs some improvement, and we hope to implement that in July. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fast-casting exploits. We're working hard 
      to get a fix for this in either July or August. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Next Month and Beyond </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    As we mentioned above, next month will see the advent of the first stage of 
    Tinkering, as well as changes to Drain and other Transfer spells. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While we have mentioned more Treasure system 
    changes (affecting both armor and weapons) for the last two months, we 
    unfortunately have had to postpone these changes due to our focusing on the 
    Magic and Tinkering systems. We really think July will see at least some of 
    these changes; August for sure! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And while it will be hard for us to rival the 
    suspense and excitement building in our current storyline, we will discuss 
    two top-secret issues in our next Letter to the Players. People have 
    suspected one of the issues for a long time, but the other is something that 
    almost no one ever knew? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">See you next month! </font></p>

    Astroth1 in AsheronsCall asks: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi, in the 
    next patch, you have given a hint <br>
    about fixing dagger to be more fair to the game. Is that change indeed <br>
    nerfing triple strike?</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are our long 
    term plans for weapons, including <br>
    dagger.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Please keep in 
    mind that these new systems are still being designed, and are subject to 
    change, perhaps drastic change.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Our ultimate goal 
    for tinkering is to allow players <br>
    to &quot;imbue&quot; random loot melee weapons with various special dynamics.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, I 
    could try to make any loot generated <br>
    mace I found, a double-striking mace.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, each time I 
    attempt to imbue a weapon, I risk <br>
    destroying it.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">And I can only 
    imbue a weapon once, I can't <br>
    &quot;double-imbue&quot; a weapon.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The exact list of 
    &quot;imbue&quot; characteristics is still to <br>
    be determined</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">But such dynamics 
    as double-strike, perhaps <br>
    triple-strike, a weapon that randomly casts a certain spell, etc. are all
    <br>
    being considered.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">One important 
    thing about these new imbued weapons, is that their effect will never work 
    100% of the time</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">So that even if 
    you did have a triple-strike spear, <br>
    for example, the number of times you successfully triple-striked would <br>
    depend on the type of weapon, and your skill level.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">If and when we do 
    implement this new dynamic, our <br>
    thought right now is to remove all hilts from the game.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">So that all 
    weapons follow this new dynamic.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    kentroop_turbine says: </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Until we introduce 
    this feature, however, <br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If there is one constant that defines all 
    massive multiplayer online games it is change. We feel this is especially 
    true of <i>Asheron's Call</i>. In the past few months we've revised the 
    treasure system--and we aren't done yet! We've simplified how magic works, 
    and provided a thrilling story arc whose effects will resonate far into the 
    future. Now we are on the cusp of adding the new Tinkering system to the 
    game, along with entirely new Tinkering skills. All of us are extremely 
    excited about this system and feel that it is going to introduce fascinating 
    new dynamics for all <i>Asheron's Call </i>players. The thrust of this 
    letter is to convey to you the whys, hows and whats of this new system.

    <p><span class="Head"><b>What's This About a Skill Credit Refund? </b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    In July, the old Appraisal skills will be completely removed from the game. 
    They will not be available for new characters to train. However, the 
    Tinkering skills will be available for them. Existing characters that had 
    either trained or specialized an Appraisal will be refunded the skill point 
    cost for those skills. The exceptions to this are Gharu'ndim characters. 
    Instead of being refunded the skill point cost of their default racial 
    skill, Item Appraisal, they will be trained in Item Tinkering, their new 
    default racial skill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Any experience that was spent in the Appraisal skills will 
    be completely refunded to the character. This includes any experience a 
    Gharun'dim character may have spent in Item Appraisal. If any skill tesseras 
    were spent to increase the character's Appraisal skills, the experience 
    equivalent to purchasing that point of skill will be refunded to that 
    character. This does not, however, reset the quest flag for those tessera. 
    In addition, the experience represented by the +5 skill points for training 
    (+10 skill points for specializing) an Appraisal that was given to a 
    character at creation will not be returned to the character. </font></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Tinkering actually involves two steps. The first step is salvaging certain 
    materials--like steel or alabaster--from items generated by the treasure 
    system. These salvaged materials are collected until you have a certain 
    quantity and are then used to enhance the abilities of another item. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While all material types found in the game 
    are salvageable, only a handful of materials currently have defined 
    enhancing effects. More effects will be assigned to materials in the coming 
    months. In addition, players won't see the effects provided by Magic Item 
    Tinkering in July, but we hope they will be available in August. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Example: </b>Keryth's patron Tarka 
    gives her a quantity of Salvaged Wool. The item is described as “Salvaged 
    Wool (75)”in her inventory. Examining it reveals that Armor Tinkering uses 
    this material and that it increases armor's cold resistance. It also reveals 
    that the average workmanship of the material is 4. Her patron also gives her 
    “Salvaged Ivory (15)”. Examining this reveals that this item has no apparent 
    use (no Tinkering skill uses it).</i></font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How Do I Salvage? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The Tinkering skills--like the Appraisals--can be used without being 
    trained, so any character can salvage. Trained characters though will have 
    the advantage of being able to salvage more material and value from an item 
    than untrained characters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For a character to start their career in 
    salvaging, they will need to purchase an Ust. Ust is an ancient Empyrean 
    word meaning “That Which Reduces” and is a fundamental part of the salvaging 
    process. An Ust will be easy for players to find, as vendors in the major 
    cities will be selling them at a low cost. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once the Ust is in the character's inventory, 
    double-clicking on it will bring up the Salvage panel. Items of similar 
    material types can be dragged into the panel, and once the player has all 
    the items they want to salvage in the panel, they can click the Salvage 
    button. The character then receives a portion of the material salvaged from 
    the original items. The amount of material returned is based upon the 
    workmanship of the items put in and the character's highest Tinkering skill.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Example: </b>After defeating a pack of 
    Banderling Maulers, Keryth picks up a Flawless Gold Hammer, an Utterly 
    Flawless Pyreal Tungi, and a set of Exquisitely Crafted Gold Bracers. None 
    of these items are really worth hanging on to, so she decides to salvage 
    materials from them.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>She places all three of the items in the 
    Ust, but the Ust won't let her salvage them because they are different 
    materials. Noticing her mistake, she places the Gold Hammer and the set of 
    Gold Bracers in the Ust. The Ust reduces the items into “Salvaged Gold 
    (10)”. Examining the gold reveals that it is of an average workmanship of 6. 
    Placing the Pyreal Tungi in the Ust by itself creates “Salvaged Pyreal 
    (3)”in her inventory. Examining the pyreal will show an average workmanship 
    of 8.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Later on Keryth comes across a 
    Well-Crafted Pyreal Yumi. She places the salvaged pyreal she created earlier 
    and the Yumi into the Salvage panel. The Yumi and the previously salvaged 
    pyreal are combined into “Salvaged Pyreal (4)”. Examining the pyreal now 
    reveals that the average workmanship is 5.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The salvaged materials also retain a portion 
    of the value of the items used in their creation, but retain almost none of 
    the burden of those items. These salvaged materials can then be sold to 
    almost any vendor, if the player has no interest in using them in later 
    Tinkering processes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Example: </b>The combined value of the 
    Gold Hammer and the set of Gold Bracers used by Keryth to create her 
    salvaged gold was 8,360 pyreals and their combined weight was 875 bu. The 
    salvaged gold is worth 842 pyreals and weighs 100 bu.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As each item is added, its workmanship will 
    affect the value and average workmanship of the entire stack. Combining 
    shoddy items with a stack of higher workmanship material will reduce the 
    workmanship of the stack as a whole. Items can continue to be added to a 
    stack until the stack reaches 100 units of material. At that point no more 
    material can be added to the stack and the player should start a new stack. 
    Also, smaller stacks of material can be combined into larger ones. When 
    combining smaller stacks of material, the skill of the salvager does not 
    affect the quantity or value of the material in the resulting combined 
    stack. Players should be aware that if the total material in the smaller 
    stacks is over 100, the excess materials are lost. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Example: </b>Keryth has two stacks of 
    salvaged gold in her inventory. One stack is “Salvaged Gold (40),”which has 
    an average workmanship of 8 and a value of 4,323 pyreals. The other stack is 
    “Salvaged Gold (65)”with an average workmanship of 9 and a value of 6,468 
    pyreals.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>When she combines these stacks in her Ust, 
    she receives “Salvaged Gold (100)”. Examining the combined stack of gold 
    shows that its average workmanship is 8 and it is worth 10,278 pyreals. The 
    5 excess units were lost.</i> </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How Do I Enhance? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Once there are 100 units in a stack of salvaged materials, the material is 
    ready to be used to enhance an item. While all characters can salvage, only 
    characters with trained Tinkering skills can attempt to enhance an item. In 
    addition, since each material is specific to the Tinkering skill that uses 
    it, only characters trained in the right skill can use that material. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Enhancing an item is the most dangerous step 
    in Tinkering as there is a risk of destroying the item if the Tinkering 
    fails. Additionally, whether the enhancement was a success or a failure, the 
    salvaged material is always consumed in the process. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a variety of factors that affect 
    how difficult it is to enhance an item. Some factors make the application 
    easier, while others make it more difficult. The workmanship of the item 
    being enhanced increases the difficulty, as a higher workmanship item is 
    harder to enhance than a lower one. Also some enhancements are harder than 
    others, making the enhancement harder. Finally, the number of times the item 
    has been tinkered increases the difficulty. Making the process easier is the 
    average workmanship quality of the salvaged materials; higher workmanship 
    materials are easier to work with than shoddy materials. Of course, the 
    higher the skill of the Tinker the better chance they have of successfully 
    applying the enhancement. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Example: </b>After her hunts, Keryth 
    comes back with quite a few salvaged materials. The items used to create 
    some of her salvaged materials weren't of the best workmanship and aren't 
    complete stacks, so she decides to sell them. However she did come back with 
    “Salvaged Gold (100)”with an average workmanship of “Flawless”. Since she's 
    trained in Item Tinkering, she decides to risk using the gold to enhance the 
    value of a favorite keepsake.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>The item she selects is an Exquisitely 
    Crafted Alabaster Orb. Crossing her fingers, she applies the salvaged gold 
    to the Orb. Unfortunately she fails and the Orb is destroyed. She also loses 
    the gold, but she knew that was going to happen, no matter whether she 
    succeeded or failed.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Back at the allegiance mansion her patron 
    surprises her and gives her “Salvaged Mahogany (100)”with an average 
    workmanship of “Incomparable”. When she examines it she sees that the 
    Mahogany is used in Weapon Tinkering and can increase the damage modifier 
    for her bow. Since she's not trained in Weapon Tinkering and knows this is a 
    difficult enhancement, she seeks out the allegiance Weapon Tinker. 
    Fortunately Jill of All Trades is there and offers to apply the Mahogany to 
    her bow. As Keryth holds her breath, Jill applies the material to the bow. 
    Fortunately Jill is successful and Keryth is thrilled to see that 4% has 
    been added to the damage modifier of her bow.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remember, no matter the success or failure of 
    the Tinker, the salvaged material is always consumed in the enhancing 
    process. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    We hope that now it's obvious why we are so excited about this new system. 
    In our own discussions we came up with a number of uses for Tinkering and we 
    are confident that it will add a whole new level of enjoyment for <i>
    Asheron's Call </i>players. We are also confident that the community will 
    come up with some fairly ingenious uses for Tinkering as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So be prepared, come July the possibilities 
    will be almost endless!</font></td>
