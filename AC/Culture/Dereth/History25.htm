      <p><span class="Head"><b>Dereth: Leafdawning PY 13 / Earth: July 2002 </b>
      </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      The scene would forever be etched in the minds of those in attendance at 
      High Queen Elysa's final ceremony, held at the Midsong Festival Stone. . . 
      Asheron slumping to the ground, his lifeblood spilling down his chest. . . 
      The appearance of Gaerlan and his unleashing of a titanic Golem on the 
      assembled, all the while boasting of his manipulation of Martine and 
      defeat of Asheron… How Elysa drew her bow and fired, again and again, 
      first at his Golem servant, then at Gaerlan himself. . . The desperate 
      flight of the Queen, using the time provided by her people's attacks to 
      escape with Asheron to his castle. . . The corpses of those killed 
      defending their Queen staining the desert sands blood red. . . And the 
      sound of Gaerlan's furious roar at Asheron's escape, echoing throughout 
      the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Above all else, those attending would 
    remember Gaerlan's parting words: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“You are a pathetic race of creatures. 
    Insignificant and worthless. But his heart is devoted to you, I have seen 
    that much.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“Well, then, I shall destroy his heart and 
    then consume his soul.”</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The target of his rage out of his reach, they 
    heard Gaerlan declare that all Derethians would be the means of his revenge 
    on Asheron. Thus his assaults began at various locations, destroying any 
    Derethian in sight. As the month of Seedsow closed and Leafdawning opened, 
    these assaults continued and intensified, culminating in organized bands of 
    elemental creatures focusing their attacks on Derethian towns. At the head 
    of these bands of elementals were materialized aspects of the Essences. The 
    four Essences had once been swirling fields of formless energy floating in 
    rings of stone. The people of Dereth had believed these Essences destroyed 
    when the cisterns located deep below them had exploded in an overflow of 
    elemental energy. However, Gaerlan's magic had channeled the Essences' 
    energy into four physical forms, one for each element. Gaerlan dubbed these 
    creations his Generals, commanding them to lead the assaults across Dereth.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elsewhere, adventurers paid a visit to the 
    hollow construct that called itself Dranith Menacet. In months previous, 
    this construct had been found in a facility created by Martine's servants. 
    When the creature had been first discovered, it had been of enormous size 
    and possessed of unprecedented power, able to throw back all attacks 
    launched against it. After Martine had been driven into catatonia by the 
    revelation that Gaerlan had manipulated him, adventurers found that Dranith 
    had shrunk in size and power. Later some theorized that Dranith was a direct 
    reflection its master, and with its master's mind broken, it lost its power. 
    Therefore, the first people to encounter him found him easy to destroy. As 
    the creature died, it wailed that it had failed its “father,” Martine, and, 
    through its death, opened the way to his home. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The way to Martine's home appeared in Rithwic. 
    Those who entered the portal found a hidden town below Rithwic populated by 
    the outcasts of society. Martine's hidden past was slowly revealed to the 
    newcomers, and they found that Martine hadn't always been the destructive 
    force infamous in the rest of Dereth. The town's residents told tales of 
    Martine's kindness to them in providing a home for them in a new world they 
    couldn't comprehend. One resident in particular, Josef, told the new 
    arrivals that Martine had changed once Gaerlan suddenly appeared in the 
    town. Somehow, Gaerlan had been freed from portal space by Martine's 
    creation of the portals to Marae Lassel. Although Josef admitted that 
    Martine had never been entirely stable, he explained that Martine's 
    instability had grown under Gaerlan's influence. He said that Gaerlan had 
    capitalized on Martine's irrational hatred of Asheron to force him on a path 
    to attack the man. Gaerlan had also twisted Martine's longing for the wife 
    he had left behind on Ispar into an irrational love of Queen Elysa. 
    Martine's plan to assassinate Prince Borelean as a means to strike at 
    Asheron had particularly shocked some of the town's residents, especially 
    Josef. However, Josef related, other residents seemed to be displaying the 
    same effects of Gaerlan's corrupting influence, becoming his willing 
    servants. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Deeper in the town, the adventurers found 
    Martine. Attempts to speak to him were met with dead silence, but two of his 
    most loyal vassals stood at his side, providing details on how Martine might 
    be healed. One claimed that reminding him of his lost wife and home would 
    help him shake off his stupor, while the other claimed that only by calling 
    to his mind the power and strength given to him by the Virindi could he be 
    awakened. In searching the town, the newcomers found two chambers, Martine's 
    studies. One study seemed to be an expression of Martine's humanity, and on 
    a desk in this study a letter to his wife was found. The other study 
    appeared to be an expression of his Virindi side, a twisted room filled with 
    the objects of Martine's hate. On the floor in this study, adventurers found 
    a folded Tusker husk, the remnants of the first Tusker Martine had killed 
    using his Virindi-enhanced magic. The newcomers found themselves with a 
    choice, to remind Martine of his past on Ispar, or of his past on Dereth.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All the while the travelers to Martine's 
    hidden town agonized over their choice, the assaults on their homes on the 
    surface continued. Each assault was led by one of Gaerlan's elemental 
    Generals, and only by defeating this General could the attack be halted. 
    However the defeated Generals were not truly killed; they arose again and 
    again, until the final assault on the town of Yanshi. Elemental creatures of 
    all types, along with all four elemental Generals, besieged Yanshi. The 
    town's defenders cut their way through rank after rank of elemental until 
    they reached each of the Generals, finally slaying them. In spite of this 
    victory, a mysterious portal appeared in Yanshi immediately follow the 
    defeat of the last General. Those that traveled through this portal 
    discovered an elemental sanctum deep below the town. Standing in the middle 
    of this sanctum, in an area completely inaccessible to those brave enough to 
    enter the sanctum, was Gaerlan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The walls echoed with his mumbled 
    incantations, incantations that were cast over the forms of his fallen 
    Generals. In listening to these incantations, the people of Dereth were 
    shocked to find they had actually aided Gaerlan by defeating his Generals. 
    The incantations revealed that he had always planned to sacrifice the 
    Generals, the physical forms of the Essences, and unite them into a single 
    form comprised of pure elemental force. It became apparent that Gaerlan had 
    used the General's attacks simply as a useful distraction. With the people's 
    attention focused on the Generals, Gaerlan was able to complete his 
    preparations to summon the Harbinger, the name he had given to this final 
    pure elemental form. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although Asheron still lay mortally wounded, 
    and the dazed Martine remained sitting in his retreat below Rithwic, a quiet 
    settled over the towns of Dereth as Leafdawning closed. . . A quiet broken 
    only by the muttering of incantations, deep below Yanshi.</font></td>
