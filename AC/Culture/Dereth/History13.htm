      As the sun warms the ground so that the earth may become bountiful a new
      threat encroaches on the land of Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Across the mountains of northern and
      southern Osteth, Drudges have come to heel beneath the rule of raiding
      parties. These Drudges, altered by the Virindi, can only have been sent
      here by their malicious masters to carry out another aspect of their
      invasion.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Patrols of Stalkers and Lurkers make their
      way through the mountains. Only by defeating them can parties gain access
      to the underground citadels of their leader. The newly organized Drudges
      call themselves The Black Claw Clan and are sworn to service of a Virindi
      known on as the Inculcator.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the purposes of purging this menace
      from the world monarchies have made great strides in bolstering
      communication within their ranks. Now allegiances can appoint speakers to
      relay information to all members with new efficiency and speed. Messages
      may be delivered on a daily basis to keep all within apprised of current
      events and happenings.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Magi of the School of the Left Hand have
      discovered the Essence of Enchantment. By feeding the scrolls of the
      school to the Essence they are gifted with the knowledge of the seventh
      sphere.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assisting those schooled in magical arts,
      archmages have developed a way to alleviate the tedium of purchasing
      reagents one by one. Now they will fill orders as determined by what their
      clients desire. As an added benefit they now consider reagent peas to be
      components as well.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the seasons change so do the creature of
      the world. New trophies can be forged into armor and keepsakes by crafters
      as the season forces creatures to shed their hides once again.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The changing tides of Solclaim have
      continued into Seedsow, but the Virindi grow bolder and still their
      motives remain hidden. They take small steps against the Children of Ispar
      and now the question is, when will they make great strides?</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head">

    </span><br>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">As the skies continue to be tainted by the 
    purple hue of portal space, the Virindi rebels under Levistras have 
    reinforced their forces to claim Dereth as their own. Opposing forces, loyal 
    to the Directive principles all Virindi have followed until now, have done 
    the same, hampering the efforts of the rebels. The loyalists have begun 
    diverting shipments of Quiddity Ingots, intended for the rebels' Tumerok 
    minions, to Isparian settlements. At the same time, those loyal to the 
    Directive have summoned more forces to Dereth, including powerful Virindi 
    Inquisitors, in the hopes of bringing all the rebels in line with the will 
    of the Quiddity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This influx of forces opened a path for brave 
    (or foolhardy) Isparians to follow to a place known to the Virindi as the 
    Singularity Caul. In the past, this island had been used by the Hopeslayer's 
    forces, but was now claimed by the rogue Virindi. From here, the Virindi 
    hoped to establish their New Singularity and bring all of Dereth under its 
    control. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While no apparent Virindi facilities could be 
    found on the Caul, the Isparians discovered one near the town of Rithwic. 
    This facility was a Virindi prison, used to hold rogue elements before their 
    destruction or return to the </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Quiddity. In an ironic twist, the Virindi 
    Master overseeing the facility had begun to exhibit the same corruption 
    observed in the rebels, individuality. This corruption went so far that he 
    even took on a name: Dirrich. His death at the hands of Isparian adventurers 
    resulted in quick reprisals from the Virindi, as more powerful Virindi and 
    their servants were found throughout the Direlands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the Virindi conflict seemed to escalate 
    around them, Isparians exploring the center of the Singularity Caul stumbled 
    into a meeting between elements of the Quiddity and a representative of the 
    Rebels. Responding to attacks from these two forces, the Isparians destroyed 
    the representatives, and in the process destroyed any hope of a peaceful end 
    to the conflict. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps with the hope of reaching an 
    agreement with the Isparians, Althoucault, Speaker of the New Directive, 
    appeared near Wai Jhou. Distrustful of the Virindi's intent, the Speaker was 
    attacked on sight and destroyed. His final thoughts were transmitted to 
    those who had struck him down--they were doomed. And now the people found 
    themselves embroiled in a war between two parties, both intent on their 
    destruction<span lang="en-us">.</span></font></p>
