      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">April 5, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She wore her fatigue as a thick and heavy 
    cloak draped over her mind. It helped protect her from the terror 
    threatening to overwhelm her. And when the fatigue was not enough to stop 
    her from thinking about the events of the last few months, she turned to 
    anger. The incandescent flame of rage burned away any shreds of panic that 
    managed to break through the dull layers of sleeplessness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Betrayal. Betrayal at every turn. Betrayed by 
    Asheron, who brought her to this strange land. Betrayed by Thorsten as his 
    lifespark vanished on the end of that demon's pincer. And now betrayed by 
    Nuhmudira, next to Asheron her closest advisor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her land was under siege. Elemental attacks 
    rising. New and powerful golems appearing in the Direlands. New enemy 
    fortifications. And now, the time when she needed sage counsel the most, she 
    was alone. Asheron had been gone for the last few weeks. He had been 
    disappearing more and more recently. Thorsten was gone forever. And 
    Nuhmudira. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She had completely vanished. Elysa had 
    trouble believing the rumors Jaleh had passed to her about Nuhmudira. No, 
    her rage would not allow her to harbor any illusion. She did not want to 
    believe the rumors. But that had nothing to do with the truth. <i>Oh, 
    Nuhmudira, what have you done?</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Could she trust no one? Even Borelean, her 
    pride and joy (<i>my son, the monster tried to kill my son. I will see you 
    dead, Martine. I will scatter your ashes to the four corners of the world. .
    </i>.), was too young to help. She could not rely on even him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The storm that Nuhmudira had warned her about 
    so many months ago had come. It could soon rage in full force. And in what 
    shape was Elysa to meet the challenge? Exhausted. Furious. Alone. She 
    thought back to an earlier time, a time of nightmares and blood. There, deep 
    in the dank stinking lair of the Olthoi Queen, she had seen her compatriots 
    and love slaughtered by a loathsome monstrosity. She remembered the brutal 
    hammering force of grief and despair, and the bright shining rage that, for 
    that moment, cleansed the despair from her soul. As she had drawn back the 
    arrow that pierced the glistening, faceted insectoid orb straight through to 
    its abominable brain, she had felt nothing but a calm, soothing vengeance.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Standing in her stone chambers, dust dancing 
    through sunlit air, that feeling once more washed through her. Exhaustion 
    and rage were both replaced by a cool sense of. . . anticipation. Deep 
    within her mind, she was readying her arrows, sharp and deadly. When a guard 
    rushed in to inform her of the latest events, he was surprised to see her 
    smiling. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Kai,” Nuhmudira's voice cracked as she 
    raised it above the whistling wind. Her red hair and dark skin showed in 
    harsh opposition to the snow-capped mountain they climbed. “How much 
    further?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kai, wearing the green leathers of a peasant, 
    turned to his master and pointed to a clearing. There a large head rested, 
    its maw gaping wide, beckoning them to enter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The library lies within, Master.” He turned 
    and entered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira pulled her robes more tightly about 
    her. Ibn Rab's blood still strengthened her body, but the chill was enough 
    to make the strongest of people shiver. A warm glow shone within the head, 
    and the soft purple glow of one of the many portals could be seen at the 
    foot of a flight of stairs that lead into an Empyrean foyer. Her reward for 
    teaching this upstart was close, so close. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She followed Kai inside. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Unlike any other gaming experience, the 
    world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. In March, the strange and 
    terrible Crystal Golems appeared. To help combat them and other dangers of 
    the land, adventurers made use of their deadly arrows and found refuge in 
    another wave of housing. For April, the changes and additions taking place 
    will all soon be revealed. Join us, as we open our April Event, Betrayal. Be 
    sure to continue your part in this incredible ongoing story, and we'll see

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">April 9, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Spring is arriving in Dereth, the snow 
    steadily retreating from its warm embrace. It is said that one may find 
    sunflowers in certain meadows. And other places report the appearance of 
    plants that have not been seen in Dereth in many months. Yet, the warm 
    sunshine and mild weather cannot completely dispel an uneasy chill of 
    anticipation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>A brother searches for his older sister, 
    seeking clues in a written trail of loss and grief. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The skies are clear of winter snow, the air 
    gentle. The sun glints off the bronze statues that grace the towns, warming 
    the rich metal. But for one errant day, the statues have been faithful in 
    gifting protections to the people. The Arcanum will still not admit to 
    providing the statues to the towns but the value of such gifts cannot be 
    disputed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Somewhere, Martine writhes in incandescent 
    madness, muttering words of vengeance and machination.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Arcanum, which has been striving steadily 
    to provide more settlement housing, hasadded more Cottages and Villas and 
    portals to most of those placed in the previous month. They have also taken 
    a new and ambitious approach--they have constructed and opened Residential 
    Quarters, which provide communal defense for large numbers of Isparians. 
    “Safety in numbers,“ is an ancient, oft-recited saying that all Isparians 
    know, from the smallest child to the highest king. Its truth cannot be 
    disputed. Within these quarters Isparians may live, laugh, make plans, all 
    the while secure from the denizens that roam the land. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Nuhmudira had disappeared. Her whereabouts 
    are still unknown.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Spring is a season of hope and as a symbol of 
    this High Queen Elysa has declared that Weddings may once again take place 
    in the land. All citizens of Dereth who wish to show their commitment to a 
    beloved one through the vows of marriage may do so, be it in a sunrise-lit 
    outdoor chapel or the faithful old Wedding Hall. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mages skilled in Item Magic are finding they 
    now have two additional Tie spells to add to their art. All Isparians have 
    been granted a means to travel to a selected Lifestone without first paying 
    the penalty of death, albeit with a loss of mana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The mild weather softens the land. The 
    sunshine warms upturned faces. And everyone tries to ignore the shadows 
    looming in the distance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Highlights include:</b> </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Endurance is now a useful attribute for 
      almost all adventurers, be they warrior, archer, or mage. Benefits include 
      faster regeneration rates, resistance to drains and damage, and more!
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New portal spells allow players to travel 
      farther and wider in their search for adventure! And once the province of 
      only a select few, now all players with Item Magic can recall through 
      their last visited portal. Also, all players, regardless of whether they 
      have Item Magic or not, can recall to a Lifestone at any time. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Residential Quarters have opened! Now you 
      have an opportunity to find a space to call your own. Recall to your home, 
      store your items, and even display a few choice possessions! With 
      thousands of rooms opening up each month, soon every player will have 
      access to these great features! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Celebrate the spring with a wedding! Now 
      you and your loved one can be joined in matrimonial bliss. Conquer 
      Jealousy, Greed, and Anger, and you and your potential mate can live 
      happily ever after. </font></li>

    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A few new dungeons and quests. </font>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wedding bells are ringing, flowers and

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new boss creature roams the Dires.

      April Letter to the Players</a> for more details. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The functionality of @lifestone has now 
      been changed such that it no longer kills you and leaves a corpse, but 
      instead returns you to your Lifestone. This animation takes roughly 15 
      seconds, and spends half of your current mana. It is available to all 
      players at all levels. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new command, @die, has the same 
      functionality as the old @lifestone command, so that one may choose to die 
      at any point, leaving a corpse. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There have been a number of changes to the 
      way Endurance functions in AC. See the

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a new Panel, the Character 
      Information Panel, which takes over the former Burden Panel. The icon for 
      the panel remains the same, but it is now a dark brown color when the 
      character is not overburdened. This new Panel relates: @age, @birth, 
      @deaths info, the new Endurance info, and the burden info (when 
      applicable). </font></li>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a new command, @allegiance boot 
      &lt;name of offending player&gt; usable only by the monarch of an allegiance. 
      This command allows a monarch to kick out a player from any level within 
      the monarch's allegiance. This works regardless of whether the character 
      is online. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is now a new option in the Character 
      Panel that allows the act of dragging an item to another player to open up 
      the Secure Trade panel with that player. This option is off by default 
      (meaning that the old behavior of: dragging an item to a player gives the 
      item to that player, still applies). </font></li>

    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements and Changes </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">150 Cottages and 50 Villas have been added 
      to the world. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">1,000 Residential Quarters have been added 
      to the world. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">House Settlement Portals for those 
      settlements added in March have been added to the world. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Along with the portal magic changes, there 
      are now only three types of portals in the world: Summonable and 
      Recallable; Recallable and Not-summonable; Non-recallable and Non-summonable. 
      A portal that is tie-able is now automatically recallable. Tie-able and 
      recallable are now synonymous terms. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, any time you cast portal recall, you 
      become subject to the restrictions placed upon the original portal that 
      was tied to. For example, if a player ties to a portal which was only 
      accessible by levels 1-20, and the player then becomes level 21, that 
      player will no longer be able to recall through or summon that portal.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Society Explorer quests have undergone 
      a minor face lift: The agents give you more information about the quests 
      in the outpost towns, all dungeons associated with quests are now 
      restricted up to level 20 (in some cases they had been restricted to level 
      6), some of the spawn timers on the quest items have been reduced to the 
      proper level (roughly 30 seconds), and the rewards are overall greater for 
      the quests. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It is now possible to imbue current 
      versions of the Hollow Sword, Axe, Spear, and Mace, to craft slightly 
      better versions. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug in our download system 
      which sometimes required players to download the patch twice or in the 
      worst cases required a complete download of a new portal.dat file. We 
      believe we have fixed this bug. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Dark Myrmidion (the creature that 
      carries the Bone Mace), has had its armor value and regeneration rate 
      lowered. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We changed the numbers on how much ammo, 
      pyreals, and components spawn when they appears through the treasure 
      system. Players should expect to find higher amounts (the spawn rate has 
      not changed, just the amount that spawns) at nearly all levels of the 
      treasure system. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Dual-spell jewelry now has a chance of 
      spawning at virtually all levels of treasure. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You must now use Victual Infusions on 
      Health and Mana Draughts, not Health and Mana Infusions, in order to 
      create Health and Mana Potions. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hooks that have been turned “invisible” by 
      house owners are now no longer selectable with the keyboard select keys. 
      Turning them visible will allow them to be selected again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We fixed a number of client crashing bugs 
      caused by trying to inscribe various items under certain conditions.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi Mounds in dungeons are now 
      ethereal, and cannot be perched upon. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There have been some slight changes to the 
      Olthoi Queen quest. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hea Raider's Cache can now only be 
      opened by a key. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The six villas in the Last-Stop-Before-Dires 
      settlement have had their villa portals to their dungeons fixed. We 
      apologize for the inconvenience. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month (March), we changed some of the 
      dynamics of the Queen Quest such that the broadcasts triggered by the 
      Quest are local broadcasts instead of global broadcasts. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The amount of treasure a Singularity Trove 
      contains has generally been increased. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The summon/recall/tie/ls spells now have 
      slightly different icons. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Training and Academy Cestuses now do 
      bludgeoning damage. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug that caused the scrollbar 
      in the Character Options Panel to not function correctly. This has been 
      fixed now. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The weight of the starter crossbow and 
      starter nabut have been reduced to 10. The poor Wayfarer (and especially 
      the Gharu'n Wayfarer) will no longer start life with over 100% burden.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Crystal Golem now can no longer fizzle 
      its spells. </font></li>

    <br>
    Once again, the April Event, Betrayal, like its predecessors, brings a host 
    of new content and gameplay to <i>Asheron's Call</i>. The one theme that 
    runs through all these changes is our desire to let players play and explore 
    more in Dereth and have more fun than ever. Let's get started: </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Housing </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    As we mentioned last month, April sees the advent of a new housing dynamic 
    in <i>Asheron's Call </i>-- Residential Quarters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Residential Quarters are comprised of 100 
    rooms, all within the same “dungeon” type space. These rooms are separate 
    from one another, and each room is owned by a separate player. The overall 
    “Quarter” has some shared communal spaces to be enjoyed by both the various 
    owners and the public, but only the owner and their guest list may enter the 
    specific room. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each room has a few hooks upon which to place 
    items, as well as a 50-item capacity storage chest. The cost to purchase the 
    room will be 100,000 pyreals and a Writ of Refuge. The maintenance cost for 
    the room will be 10,000 pyreals, due every three months, as opposed to the 
    maintenance period for the other types of housing, which is one month.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Players will also be able to recall to their 
    RQ room, using the same command they would for a Cottage or Villa. One 
    difference between RQs and landscape housing is that the location of your RQ 
    will not show up on your House panel. Also, keep in mind that a player may 
    not own both a landscape dwelling and a RQ room, just one or the other.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for the overall implementation of RQs now 
    and in the future: This month there will be a 3-city ring, each with one 
    portal leading to a “hub” dungeon. This dungeon will have 10 portals inside, 
    each one leading to a different dungeon, each dungeon containing 100 RQ 
    rooms. So for April, there will be 1000 RQ rooms available per world. For 
    May, we are planning on an additional 2000 RQ rooms per world. There will 
    probably be another 2000 rooms available in June. We will also continue to 
    add landscape housing during this time. This month we are releasing another 
    200 total landscape units: 150 cottages and 50 villas. We are committed to 
    adding both kinds of housing until every player has an option of owning 
    either a landscape dwelling or an RQ. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our future plans for housing include (all of 
    these are scheduled for some time in the next 5 months -- if that estimate 
    changes, we will let you know): </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Adding more usable hooks in the mansions.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allowing players to be able to use pyreals 
      and Writs to purchase additional storage space in their houses. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allowing players to be able to use items 
      while the items are on a hook, and create content that takes advantage of 
      this ability, e.g. questing for a portal to (cool place X) to put in your 
      house. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Endurance </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    For the past two years, people at Turbine and Microsoft have been discussing 
    what to do with Endurance. We were distressed that players not only felt 
    that having a high Endurance carried no real benefit during the longer 
    stages of a character's life, but in fact felt that having a higher 
    Endurance was a curse at the higher levels due to drain and a difficulty in 
    healing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was counter-intuitive to us on many 
    levels, and we kicked around a lot of ideas on how to make Endurance a more 
    valuable attribute, and one that would increase the fun for players. Here is 
    what we came up with: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, some combination of strength and 
    endurance (with endurance being more important) now allows one to regenerate 
    hit points at a faster rate the higher one's endurance is. This bonus is in 
    addition to any regeneration spells one may have placed upon themselves. 
    This regeneration bonus caps at around 110%. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, the higher a player's Endurance, the 
    less stamina one uses while attacking. This benefit is tied to Endurance 
    only, and it caps out at around 50% less stamina used per attack. The 
    minimum stamina used per attack remains one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Third, the higher a player's Endurance, the 
    more likely they are not to use a point of stamina to successfully evade a 
    missile or melee attack. A player is required to have Melee Defense for 
    melee attacks or Missile Defense for missile attacks trained or specialized 
    in order for this specific ability to work. This benefit is tied to 
    Endurance only, and it caps out at around a 75% chance to avoid losing a 
    point of stamina per successful evasion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fourth, some combination of strength and 
    endurance (the two are roughly of equivalent importance) now allows one to 
    partially resist drain health and harm attacks, up to a maximum of roughly 
    50%. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fifth, some combination of strength and 
    endurance (the two are roughly of equivalent importance) now allows one to 
    have a level of &quot;natural resistances&quot; to the 7 damage types. This caps out 
    at a 50% resistance (the equivalent to level 5 life prots) to these damage 
    types. This resistance is not additive to life protections: higher level 
    life protections will overwrite these natural resistances, although life 
    vulns will take these natural resistances into account, if the player does 
    not have a higher level life protection cast upon them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, a player will not get a free 
    protective bonus from natural resistances if they have both Prot 7 and Vuln 
    7 cast upon them. The Prot and Vuln will cancel each other out, and since 
    the Prot has overwritten the natural resistances, there will be no 
    resistance bonus. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The natural resistances, drain resistances, 
    and regeneration rate info are now visible on the Character Information 
    Panel, in what was once the Burden panel. This panel now displays the above 
    three Endurance benefits, the burden info, as well as @age, @deaths, and 
    @birth info. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 5 categories for the endurance benefits 
    are, in order from lowest benefit to highest: Poor, Mediocre, Hardy, 
    Resilient, and Indomitable, with each range of benefits divided up equally 
    amongst the 5 (e.g. Poor describes having anywhere from 1-10% resistance 
    against drain health attacks, etc.). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few other important notes: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The abilities that Endurance or 
      Endurance/Strength conveys are not increased by Strength or Endurance 
      buffs. It is the raw Strength and/or Endurance scores that determine the 
      various bonuses. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">For April, natural resistances will offer 
      some protection versus hollow type damage, whether it is from a Hollow 
      Minion or a Hollow weapon. This will be changed in May. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">These abilities are player-only, creatures 
      with high endurance will not benefit from any of these changes. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Come May, you can type @help endurance for 
      a summary of the April changes to Endurance. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Portal/Transportation Changes </b></span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other major change for the month of April 
    is our new dynamics for lifestone recalling and item magic portal spells.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are the basic changes: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All characters at all levels, regardless 
      of whether they have Item Magic, will be able to use the command @lifestone 
      to return to the lifestone they have attuned themselves to. This command 
      will take a 15 second animation (during which you cannot move), and cost 
      half of the player's current mana. This will also be the lifestone you are 
      returned to when you die. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players with Item Magic will get the 
      following benefits: </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A Lifestone Tie spell. The Lifestone 
        that they use the Tie spell on will be the Lifestone they recall to when 
        they cast Lifestone Recall. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An ability to Tie to, Recall to, and 
        Summon a second Portal. Players with Item Magic now will be able to cast 
        Primary Portal and Secondary Portal spells. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new Portal Recall spell, 
        called?drumroll?.Portal Recall (as opposed to Primary Portal Recall and 
        Secondary Portal Recall). This spell allows one to recall through the 
        last used portal, as long as that portal was tieable. </font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of these changes, Portals are 
      now either Tieable and Summonable, Tieable and Not-Summonable, or Not-Tieable 
      and Not-Summonable. Tieable is now synonymous with Recallable. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Also as a result of these changes, Portals 
      maintain their restrictions regardless of whether you are trying to enter 
      them, recall through them, or summon them. For example, if you are level 
      30, you will not be able to recall through a portal that has a level 
      restriction against anyone above level 20. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The portal that you were tied to with the 
      old Portal Tie spell, will be the portal you are tied to with the Primary 
      Portal Tie spell. Primary Portal Recall will recall you through that 
      portal. If you had learned the old Portal Tie/Summon/Recall spells, you 
      will automatically know the Primary Portal spells. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the @die command replaces the old 
      @lifestone command. You may use @die to die and leave behind a corpse.
      </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We hope these changes allow people to explore 
    and hunt in areas they had never encountered before. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Weddings </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    Two months ago, Ken Karl, the Microsoft Project Manager for <i>Asheron's 
    Call</i>, and Eric Helbig, Microsoft Test Lead for <i>AC</i>, came to 
    Turbine to pay us a visit. Their mission was clear: They wanted weddings in
    <i>AC </i>and they wanted them now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few weeks before that, they had asked when 
    we could put weddings back in the game. When we told them that we had no 
    time for weddings, that if they wanted them so bad, they could come to 
    Turbine and do it themselves, we were very surprised when they said, “Ok.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So began a week of grueling training and 
    effort. Ken and Eric slaved over banks of computers for days trying to both 
    learn the ins and outs of being a Turbine content designer, as well as 
    implementing the basics of what was known as The Wedding Bells quest. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, at the end of the week, sweaty and 
    exhausted, Ken and Eric left Turbine to go back to Seattle, happy in their 
    efforts to get Wedding Bells in for April. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, half the work was still undone 
    (Those crafty MS people?.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, Kim Payson and Sean Huxter heroically 
    stepped in and finished the job, using the design specs that Ken and Eric 
    had so thoughtfully left for us. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We hope you enjoy the fruits of all their 
    efforts?. let us know where you went for your honeymoon. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Hot Topics </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hollow Weapons ? The Hollow Weapon 
      Upgrades are now in for April. The Hollow Sword, Axe, Mace, and Spear have 
      been upgraded. Keep in mind that if you choose to upgrade your weapon 
      (through a process which you will have to discover in-game), the weapon 
      will have a wield requirement on it of 250 in the skill of the weapon.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We hope that making all levels of jewelry 
      have a small percentage chance of having a double spell helps people of 
      all levels find jewelry appropriate to their level. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allegiance @boot command. As a monarch you 
      now have a much-asked for tool to help control and organize your 
      allegiance. We always appreciate feedback both on how this tool works for 
      you, and other tools allegiances and fellowships need to manage these 
      social structures. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some specific details about the 
    command: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Exact syntax: @allegiance boot &lt;name of 
      character to boot&gt; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">This command breaks the allegiance between 
      the named character and that character's patron, just as if the patron had 
      renounced the named character. Therefore, this command does not affect the 
      experience cost for the booted character to swear allegiance to someone 
      else. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, this command does not affect the 
      bonds of allegiance between the booted character and his or her vassals -- 
      they remain sworn to the booted character and therefore are also no longer 
      part of the booting monarch's allegiance. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Known Issues </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Please take note with the Drag and Drop Secure Trade option in the Character 
    Panel: If you don't hit Apply after making the choice, it will not take 
    effect, and dragging an item to a player will just result in giving that 
    item to the player. This was mainly implemented for those players who 
    inadvertently drag something to another player other than the player the 
    item was intended for. If you actually want to initiate Secure Trade with a 
    player, you can now just double-click on the player. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Two issues with the Wedding Bells quest:
    </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you dye the male wedding raiment it 
      will always be green. This will be fixed in May. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players are currently unable to dye the 
      female wedding raiment. This will be fixed in May. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As mentioned above, currently Natural 
    Resistances help a player resist Hollow Damage. We are changing this back in 
    May (we could not fix it in time for April) for two reasons: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In terms of PvP, changing this dynamic 
      would further reduce the effectiveness of Hollow Weapons, in a context in 
      which they generally need to be made more effective rather than less.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Even more importantly, while we initially 
      implemented the Natural Resistances in this fashion, after further 
      discussion we realized that the whole goal of Natural Resistances was to 
      mimic Life Protections, not be superior to the functionality of Life 
      Protections. And if we wanted to keep Hollow creatures as the effective 
      threat they are, we would need to upgrade their capabilities over time. 
      Ultimately, we have decided to make Natural Resistances have no effect on 
      Hollow damage. This will be done in May. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Next Month and Beyond </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    For May, we will be working on a number of different tweaks to dynamics to 
    improve them for playability and fun. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the highlights (please keep in mind 
    that some of these items might be pushed out to later months): </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players losing fewer items when dying at 
      the lower levels. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Making all items appraisable, regardless 
      of skill or level of player, thereby removing all the functionality of the 
      appraise skills. This will set up our replacement of the Appraisals skills 
      with a whole new branch of skills, which will open up many new crafting 
      branches for players. Part one of these changes is scheduled for June. We 
      will release more information in May about what our plans are. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Further treasure changes, focusing mostly 
      on Armor ? improving armor quality and distribution in many of the same 
      ways we tweaked weapons. Also we will continue to make some small tweaks 
      to the weapon loot system. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An upgrade to the Fellowship Panel, so 
      that players can see the health, stamina, and mana of all players in their 
      fellowship. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">And lots of other cool things as well?.
      </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After May, we will be working on tweaking and 
    improving magic, melee skills, crafting skills, abilities to explore the 
    incredible amount of content in <i>AC</i>, housing improvements, the 
    mid-level play experience, and a new high-level playground. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We think we've made some significant progress 
    on our goals over these last few months, and we're really excited about the 
    next six months, both with our story and our game. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, we AC1 folks over here at Turbine and 
    Microsoft acknowledge that Asheron's Call 2 looks incredible and is going to 
    rock the house. But we're not planning on going anywhere for awhile. The 
    best of <i>AC </i>is yet to come. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for playing Asheron's Call! </font>

    Spring is arriving in Dereth, the snow steadily retreating from its warm 
    embrace. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>It is said that one may find 
    sunflowers in certain meadows. And other places report the appearance of 
    plants that have not been seen in Dereth in many months. Yet, the warm 
    sunshine and mild weather cannot completely dispel an uneasy chill of 
    anticipation.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">(A 
    brother searches for his older sister, seeking clues in a written trail of

    <p class="MsoNormal">The skies are clear of winter snow, the air gentle. The 
    sun glints off the bronze statues that grace the towns, warming the rich 
    metal. But for one errant day, the statues have been faithful in gifting 
    protections to the people. The Arcanum will still not admit to providing the 
    statues to the towns but the value of such gifts cannot be disputed.</p>

    chapel or the faithful old Wedding Hall. The mild weather softens the land. 
    The sunshine warms upturned faces. And everyone tries to ignore the shadows 
    looming in the distance.</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">ALLEGIANCE HALL<b><br>
    </b>As campaigns progress, their leaders continue to reach exalted ranks. On 
    Morningthaw, the first Rank 10 Gharu'ndim has come to power. RADWAR, leader 
    of <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151186.asp">Phoenix Rising</a> 
    proudly stands as the first Sultana of the game.</p>
    <p>Yet even as the established allegiances build higher, new ones continue 
    to form. On Frostfell, two more groups have established their charter and 
    started recruiting members:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151187.asp">the Red Order of 
    Gimps</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151188.asp">the

    On Darktide, formidable
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151189.asp">Clan Direwolf</a> 
    begins their hunt. And on Morningthaw,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151190.asp">the Knights of 
    Templar</a> defend their morals of Honor, Dedication, and Respect for their 
    fellow Derethians.</span></p>

    FanStory.com has listed their latest tale of <i>Asheron's Call</i>: &quot;Distant 
    Sands,&quot; first chapter in the ongoing novel, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/nl/151192.asp">Young 
    Rachel the Red</a>&quot;:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Rain poured down on Southern Dereth. The deserts of 
    the South rarely received the precious liquid, but during the short rainy 
    season it could arrive with unbridled force. The young woman crouched under 
    an overhang across from the tavern, cradling her bow to keep it dry. Thunder 
    boomed in the sky overhead, and streaks of lightning flashed over the 
    desert. As one bolt of lightning illuminated the town, Rachael glimpsed the 
    two cloaked men moving towards the tavern. She cursed under her breath, she 
    would have missed them if not for the lightning. Silent as a wraith she 
    began to move.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
