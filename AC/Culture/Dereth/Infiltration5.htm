	</b>Nova Knight of MT reports: &quot;I had just got on after finally getting my 
    account back up after years of absence, and already stuff was happening. 
    +Leo Shooting Star sent a broadcast to find him hiding in an obscure dungeon 
    near Khayyaban and answer a question. I ran over and found him. I was the 
    first one there and he asked, &quot;Who is Queen Elysa's son?&quot; Unable to even 
    recall how to take a screenshot, I called out the last name I could recall 
    from the old lore: &quot;Thorsen.&quot; That was quite incorrect. I told him I'd just 
    woken up from a couple years sleep and my memory was a bit fuzzy. =P. Then, 
    No Leaf Clover walked up and promptly answered the question. +Leo 
    congratulated him, made a global message about the festivities, and handed 
    him a writ. Then Yoshi's Bubbles came in shortly before +Leo bid us better 
    luck next time (!!) and left. I asked No Leaf what he got and when he told 
    me I said, &quot;cool, I need to get one of those.&quot; Then No Leaf gave it to me! 
    I'll be able to get a cottage now no problem. It's as if I've never left. 
    Best welcome back ever. A bit later, +Leo messaged me welcoming me back to 
    Dereth. I had just taken an SAT before this whole thing, so you can imagine 
    the joy.&quot;<br>

	after not being able to have a sub for awhile and log into my friend telling 
	me of an event in Arwic. It was outside Arwic to be exact. :) Tons of 
	monster spawns and at the end we all got cows and black pearls that boosted 
	our attributes by 2 for 10 minutes. The LeM said he was the designer of the 
	items and armor in the game and wanted to view the coding to my BP and 
	Bracers. Here is a pic of that....hope you use it in the few you will pick 
	out. It has a variety of people in it and you can read the chat log about 
	him wanting to see my armor. thx Maggie and keep up the good work :)<br>

	<br>
	Hello again Maggie!<br>
	<br>
	Today I was just playing around on my trade bot when I noticed a message 
	appear on my screen saying that there was an attack in Arwic, kinda by 
	subway. When I got there, I noticed all the Oblits everywhere! I immediately 
	got into a fellow and started the fun! I had a blast killin the Oblits! Then 
	when they died, the +LeM brought in some TM's for us to play with! When the 
	TM's died we asked for more and you know how the +LeM's like to play! So of 
	course Pookie had to make an appearance. Pookie probably killed about 4 
	people before some one killed him. lol Gotta love the Bunny Smite!!! lol 
	Then when we thought it was all over, the +LeM gave us a &quot;parting gift&quot; so 
	to speak.... He brought in a WHOLE group of Viamontians and Eaters! And this 
	time I got to take some SS of the whole thing! w00t!!! So all in all I had a 
	blast just like I do with every single one of these great live events!!! 
	Turbine keep them commin!!!<br>

    dungeon and some guy was going &quot;lol lol&quot; all alone in the top room. I said 
    what's um...what's so funny? He said, look at my corpse, they are attacking 
    Rithwic. I ID'd his corpse and it said, &quot;blah blah blah, killed by 
    banderling heirophant&quot;.... That was weird cuz I was in the Lugian 
    dungeon.... Off 2 rith I go.... Along the river I found a small group of 
    players and an LEO...and they were all saying, &quot;Spawn a TM! Spawn BZ!!&quot; and 
    &quot;Nah, he can only spawn non quest monsters.&quot; &quot;Well spawn some eaters....or 
    black breaths!!!!&quot; So this LEO proceeds to bring a group of oblits. They 
    die. Then a group of paradoxes. They die. Then a group of Viamonts and 
    eaters, then a TM!!! In Rithwic!! This LEO was taking orders like a 
    McDonalds employee, saying, &quot;Well isn't it my job to make the game more 
    fun?!&quot; I was in awe as I WAS having the time of my life 4 sure.... Here I 
    was in a starter town...killing all these bosses with a small group of 
    players on a Sunday night late.... It was great, and the xp was fun too. Got 
    like 12 mil in the fellow I was in. Got some keys. Then all of a sudden the 
    LEO says, &quot;well that's it. I need to go do this on another world now,&quot; and 
    he spawns a huge group of oblits, some white rabbits and a few biakas. Then 
    it was all over...and I never died once, thank goodness.... btw, the funny 
    thing was the name of our fellowship was &quot;CONTENT PLEASE.&quot; </font></p>

	<font face="Arial">Hi Maggie, Love your site. Grats on the new Jackcat 
    Forums too. Sunday Night ( 5/15) on Solclaim we had a fantastic game event, 
    orchestrated by +LeM Kyoshi. Rithwic was invaded. I missed the start, I 
    believe it was Virindi in the first wave. When I arrived, wave after wave of 
    Obliterators were swarming the brave defenders. We'd just barely finish off 
    one wave and the next would spawn, 6 at a time. Woohooo. Death and mayhem 
    ensued. After many heroic deaths and recoveries, we finally vanquished the 
    invaders. Then we got the reward, and boy did we all Have a Cow!! +LeM 
    Kyoshi sprinkled pack cows among the defenders. A Devilmouse cow, to be 
    specific. (Kyoshi told us that Devilmouse was the original team lead artist 
    when AC started.) An exact model of the cow in Eastham (and I suppose in all 
    towns), right down to the map of Dereth on one side and of Marae Lassel on 
    the other. I don't know if all pack cows have this, but each one is 
    inscribed with a number by Devilmouse. Mine says &quot;Cow, No. 31337&quot; The best 
    game event I've been to so far. Thanks to Turbine and to Kyoshi.</font></p>

	<br>
	A Dark Force gathered east of Sweet Maple Cottages on Morningthaw today. I 
	got there and joined a group fighting grievvers and shadows. I spent the 
	entire fight as a devoted healer to the rest of my fellowship, and it was 
	very much needed later on. A few of the Black Breath popped by to say hello 
	and take a bit out of Quirky Urchin, then a few marguls, and then the mother 
	of all demon/dragon Marguls jumped up, one Al'Cani.<br>
	<br>
	He moved so quickly, that it took some effort getting a screen shot of him, 
	but I got one with his stats for you. Hope you can use it.<br>
