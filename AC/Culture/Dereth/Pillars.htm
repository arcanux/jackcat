	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In a deep cavern, hidden far 
	from the prying eyes and sharpened steel of Isparians, torchlight flickered 
	across a stone table. Two figures stood there, bent over maps and 
	parchments. <br>
	<br>
	The larger of the two, a gray giant in black and gold armor, stepped back 
	from the table. He stood quietly for a moment and then spoke in a voice that 
	sounded like an avalanche. “Are we ready, then?”<br>
	<br>
	His companion wore a green tunic and yellow sash which stood out in stark 
	contrast from his black fur. His voice was not as deep but held the same 
	note of strength. <br>
	<br>
	“Patience, my friend. I have not finished going through the most recent 
	reports.”<br>
	<br>
	The other made a rumbling noise and clenched his fist. “Niarltah, we know 
	what we must do. Let us get on with it!” <br>
	<br>
	“No, Muldaveus. Not yet,” Niarltah replied. His eyes remained focused on the 
	page in his hand. <br>
	<br>
	Muldaveus roared with frustration and with one enormous hand swept half the 
	table clear. He slammed his fist down onto the table’s surface, took a 
	moment to gather himself, and spoke through clenched teeth. “While you go 
	over these documents, our time is slipping through our fingers! The 
	Isparians have raided the valley fortress and it is almost certain that they 
	know of our plans! We cannot waste any more time!”<br>
	<br>
	Niarltah stood from the table, put down the parchment that he had been 
	reading, smoothed his tunic and looked at Muldaveus. Although the Lugian was 
	much more massive, they stood eye to eye. <br>
	<br>
	“I am well aware of the situation in the Direlands,” Niarltah said calmly. 
	“I read it in Kamenua’s report. And yes, time may not be on our side, but it 
	would be foolish to make our move without being sure that we have all of the 
	necessary facts.” <br>
	<br>
	He picked up a parchment seemingly at random from the stack at his side. He 
	looked down at it and his eyes narrowed. “Example: There are reports that 
	the Burun have begun attacking Isparian settlements. Question: Will this 
	cause the Isparians to increase their counterattacks in the Blackmire and 
	the A’mun?”<br>
	<br>
	Muldaveus began to answer, but Niarltah interrupted him. “I already know the 
	answer, my friend,” he said with a malicious grin. He drew another parchment 
	from the stack. “My spies have reported increased activity in the Isparian 
	cities, centered on the large stone halls and the new crystals that their 
	mages and alchemists have created. In addition, my reports state that the 
	Isparians have found means to prepare for battle more quickly, and that they 
	are spending less time in the shops of those who sell magical scrolls.” 
	Niarltah waited for Muldaveus to reply.<br>
	<br>
	“But what does this tell us?” Muldaveus asked. “Nothing!”<br>
	<br>
	Niarltah’s grin grew wider. “It tells us what they are not doing, my friend. 
	They are not, as yet, attempting to block our plans. They are not increasing 
	their attacks on the newcomers. I believe they are still thinking that they 
	should wait and see.”<br>
	<br>
	At this, Muldaveus began to grin himself, a fearsome sight to behold. “And 
	what more do your reports tell you of the newcomers?” he asked.<br>
	<br>
	“They continue to drive the Mosswarts out of the swamps, killing those that 
	linger behind. The survivors have been migrating west and south... there are 
	some rumors of a new cult rising in the midst of the fleeing packs. 
	Interesting...” Niarltah paused briefly, his eyes narrowing. “Apparently a 
	particularly bright Mosswart approached the Isparians, asking for help. 
	According to my spies, the results were mixed. A Mosswart!” Niarltah spat. 
	“On our world some of us hunted them for sport!”<br>
	<br>
	He was reaching for another parchment when there was a knock at the door. A 
	Lugian entered, and his deep voice betrayed his excitement when he addressed 
	Muldaveus. “My Lord, they have all arrived. We are all ready.” <br>
	<br>
	The door closed and Niarltah set his pages down on the stone table. “Now. 
	Now it is time.”</font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shoulder to shoulder they stood in ranks, 
	Tumeroks and Lugians. Muldaveus looked out at their massed strength and 
	remembered the day that they had broken free from their masked and cloaked 
	masters. As they murmured among themselves, Muldaveus remembered the pride 
	of their victory, immediately followed by humiliating defeat after defeat at 
	the hands of the Isparians. He remembered the failure of the siege at 
	Tethana and the disaster at the fortress in the Lost Wish Mountains. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But that was the past. He raised his mighty 
	arms and the assembled forces quieted immediately.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“My friends!” he called out in a voice that 
	filled the cavern and reverberated from the walls. “For too long we have 
	sought victory over the Isparians and our foolish brothers! We have sought 
	allies, but our travels into the dark valley brought no aid. But we did not 
	give up! Now, we stand poised to take the victory that we deserve!” He shook 
	one fist and the Tumeroks and Lugians cheered. </font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the June Letter to the Players!<br>
	<br>
	Last month in Dereth, a new factor was added to the Burun threat – the 
	Lugian and Tumerok Renegades. The Renegades, having failed to capture Fort 
	Tethana several months ago, appear to be trying to parley with these new 
	creatures. A unified front could be disastrous for Isparian life in Dereth.<br>
	<br>
	The Burun continue to impact Dereth in new ways. Emboldened packs have begun 
	attacking southern Sho towns in lightning raids. Small bands of Mosswarts 
	have been reported migrating away from the Blackmire, and rarely Isparians 
	have been approached by lone Mosswarts seeking aid.<br>
	<br>
	The Council continues to investigate, even as they maintain their work on 
	improvements to towns and research into more efficient magic. But as they 
	work, the new threat of an alliance among our enemies hangs ominous over the 
	land.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	<i>(These are items that we plan to implement in the June event. Many of 
	these items were mentioned in prior articles.)<br>
	</i><br>
	<b>Crafting Changes<br>
	</b><br>
	In June, we will be making all player-craftable items unsellable. We will 
	also begin introducing new craft skill miniquests. These will be similar to 
	the Glenden Wood pacifists and they will reward players for crafting items 
	from store-bought components.<br>
	<br>
	For more information, please read the full article on Crafting Changes.<br>
	<br>
	PvP Weapon Changes<br>
	We plan on adjusting the weapons in the three PvP weapon suites – Weeping 
	Weapons, Hollow and Deadly Hollow Weapons, and Phantom Weapons. The most 
	powerful weapons will see their abilities slightly decreased, whereas the 
	weaker weapons will be made more powerful to improve their usefulness in PvP 
	combat.<br>
	<br>
	For more information, please read the full article on<b> </b></font><b>

	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=243">
	PvP Weapon Changes</a></font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>.</b><br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Bind Stones<br>
	<br>
	</b>As of the May event, Bind Stones have been seen next to Meeting Halls in 
	many towns. In June, these Stones will become active. <br>
	<br>
	Any monarch will be able to tie to a Bind Stone simply by double-clicking on 
	it. All monarchs will have this ability; we chose not to put restrictions on 
	it. Once that has been done, any member of the monarch’s Allegiance will be 
	able to recall to the Bind Stone location by typing <i>@allegiance hometown</i>.<br>
	<br>
	Monarchs will be able to change their Allegiance’s hometown simply by 
	double-clicking on a different Bind Stone. This can be done at any time.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Buffing Improvements – Item Magic<br>
	</b><br>
	We’ve made two important changes to the improvements that we proposed in the 
	May Letter to the Players. The first is that we will not be introducing new 
	spells – existing Item spells will be changed to affect multiple pieces of 
	armor. The second is that these spells will target your clothing as well.<br>
	<br>
	Starting in June, if you target yourself with Impenetrability or a Bane 
	spell, it will automatically cast itself on any piece of armor or clothing 
	you are wearing. The mana cost of the spell will increase by 20% of the base 
	spell cost for each enchanted piece of armor.<br>
	<br>
	For example, let’s say I am wearing an amuli coat, amuli leggings, 
	gauntlets, sollerets, a helm and a raiment, and I wish to cast Brogard’s 
	Defiance on all six pieces. Previously, I would need to cast it six times, 
	with a total mana cost of 420. Starting in June I will be able to target 
	myself and cast the spell once – it will affect all six pieces and cost 154 
	points. That’s 70 + (14 * 6) points. <br>
	<br>
	Note that these spells will only redirect to armor and clothing when they 
	are self-targeted. If you cast one of these spells on another player, they 
	will redirect to the shield as they have for several months.<br>
	<br>
	The spell will not attempt to cast on items that are Unenchantable.<br>
	<br>
	It is also important to keep in mind that this is not the sole planned 
	improvement to Item Magic buffing. We’ll be presenting ideas on additional 
	improvements in later months.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Fishing Changes<br>
	</b><br>
	In addition to the changes to crafting mentioned above, we also have some 
	small changes to fishing in order to make fishing macros less useful.<br>
	<br>
	Starting in June, we will be making the following changes:</font><ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most fish will have a value of 0.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Junk items will have a value of 0 and a 
		workmanship of 3.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The chance of finding jewelry is being 
		decreased, and jewelry will be created from the lowest wealth rating.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Tacklemaster only rewards you with 
		pyreals 25% of the time. The rest of the time he will reward you with 0 
		value potions.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Rusted Shouken will no longer be 
		stackable. If you currently have a stack of Rusted Shouken, on the day 
		of the event the stack will become <i>one</i> Rusted Shouken. Please 
		unstack these items prior to the event.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Content Revisions – Marae Lassel<br>
		</b><br>
		We will be making a number of revisions to Marae Lassel landscape 
		hunting and quests. Here is a quick summary of the most major changes:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Landscape spawns across the island 
			have been revised. There will be areas designed for New (1-20), Low 
			(20-40), Mid (40-60), and High (60-80) level characters. </font>
			</li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The generation of the Aun and Hea 
			champions (such as Aun Ralirea and Hea Temenua) and the Virindi 
			Collector will no longer be tied to the status of the Queen’s Quest. 
			Most of the items dropped by these creatures have been updated as 
			well. Characters with the existing versions of these items can 
			exchange them for the new version via an NPC if they would rather 
			have the new version.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The reward on the Olthoi Eviscerator 
			Pincer has been decreased to 2 million XP, but we’ve introduced 
			higher-level Pincer quests.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Aun Mariona, Aun Tanua’s Taiaha, 
			and Raeta’s Necklace quests have been adjusted slightly.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The town criers in Bluespire, 
			Greenspire, Redspire and Timaru now report the same news as the town 
			criers on the mainland. The Marae-specific rumors can now be found 
			on local barkeeps.<br>
			Quests not mentioned above – including the Queen’s Quest – are not 
			being revised at this time.</font></li>
			</ul>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Content Revisions – Gaerlan Quest<br>
			<br>
			</b>We made a number of revisions to the Gaerlan quest for June. The 
			majority of these changes were “under the hood”, and were made in 
			order to fix bugs in the quest and remove aspects that either broke 
			frequently or could be bypassed.<br>
			<br>
			These are the changes that are most noticeable:</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gaerlan must now be killed for 
				players to receive the quest rewards.<br>
				Handing in an Iasparilaun can be done once per day, and does not 
				require completion of the quest. There is a new XP reward for 
				characters who are level 126.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters with War Magic 
				trained will no longer get four wands before they get another 
				reward. They will randomly receive one of the four wands.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The rewards are giveable.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Once a character has received 
				all of the possible quest rewards, the cycle of rewards will 
				begin again.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We had previously mentioned the 
				possibility of a second tier of rewards for this quest, but 
				these will not be going into the game in June.</font></li>
				</ul>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Baby Animals<br>
				</b><br>
				As Spring turns to Summer, the young creatures in Dereth mature 
				into adults. If you want to get a Spring Cleaner token, you will 
				need to get one before the June event.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Verdantine</b><br>
				<br>
				As we’ve announced previously, a new Asheron’s Call world will 
				be opening concurrently with the June event: <b>Verdantine</b>. 
				This will be a standard-rules server identical to the other NPK 
				worlds. All housing on the server will be open when it goes 
				live.<br>
				<br>
				It’s quite possible that the Verdantine lobbies will be active 
				prior to the June event, but the world should not be accessible 
				until the day of the event.<br>
				<br>
				</font><font face="Arial"><b>In Development</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
				<br>
				<i>(These are the game changes that we are working on for the 
				July event. None of these items are guaranteed to be added for 
				July, as scheduling and priorities can change. Your feedback on 
				these topics is particularly valuable.)</i><br>
				<br>
				<b>Crafting Quests</b><br>
				<br>
				We plan to introduce new quests similar to the quests described 
				in </font><font face="Arial"><font size="2">the </font><b>
				<font size="2">
				<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=242">
				Crafting Changes</a></font></b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
				article. These will be intended for crafters beyond New and Low 
				levels.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Improved War Magic Critical Hits</b><br>
				<br>
				We are working on several changes that are intended to improve 
				War Magic damage over time in PvM, as well as improve the 
				usefulness of Critical Strike and Crippling Blow for projectile 
				magic. These changes include:</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently when a projectile 
					spell scores a critical hit, it adds a multiple of the base 
					damage of the spell to a normal damage roll. We are looking 
					at instead adding a multiple of the max damage of the spell 
					to that normal damage roll. This will mean that magic 
					critical hits will almost always do more damage than a 
					non-critical hit.</font></li>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We are considering 
					increasing the maximum effectiveness of Critical Strike -- 
					that is, the chance to critical -- at the highest skill 
					levels. The minimum chance to score a critical hit will not 
					be changed.</font></li>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We are considering 
					increasing the maximum effectiveness of Crippling Blow -- 
					that is, the multiplier that is applied to the extra 
					critical damage -- at the highest skill levels. The minimum 
					multiplier will not be changed.</font></li>
					</ul>
					<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The above three changes only 
					impact projectile spells in combat vs. monsters. Magic 
					criticals for PvP combat will not change.<br>
					<br>
					There is one additional change that we are considering that 
					would affect both PvP and PvM combat. The effectiveness of 
					the Critical Strike and Crippling Blow imbues scale based on 
					the attack skill of the character. There is a miniumum skill 
					below which the imbue has the minimum effect, and a maximum 
					skill above which the imbue has the maximum effect. We are 
					looking at changing the minimum and maximum skill levels for 
					magic to bring these levels more into line with melee and 
					missile levels.<br>
					<br>
					These changes are intended to improve War Magic damage over 
					time in PvM combat.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Aegis Effect for Loot Missile Weapons<br>

					<b>Content Updates</b><br>
					<br>
					We plan on making three content updates in July:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">A town to be determined 
						at a later point will have its surrounding content 
						revised in a manner similar to the revisions made to the 
						three starter towns. </font></li>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Singularity Weapons 
						quest will be revised.</font></li>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Three Crystals 
						quests – Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and Shendolain – will be 
						revised.</font></li>

						</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

						<br>
						<i>If not mentioned elsewhere in this Letter, topics

						<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=235#officers">

						implementing further Allegiance Officer ranks and tools 
						until we have further data and feedback on how the
