	</span></font></small><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">February 
	5, 2005</font><p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Fellow warriors, aid me!&quot;</p>
	<p><font size="2">Lord Kresovus woke immediately. Before he had a chance to 
	register Captain K'rank's call to arms, he leapt from his stone bed and 
	ripped his axe from the wall. The Mattekar Balor - Kresovus' companion these 
	last several years - awoke with a start, scanning their small quarters with 
	great intensity.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus hurried out of his door and looked down upon the 
	chaos of Linvak Tukal.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">For a moment, Kresovus could not make sense of the scene 
	before him. His own people, dozens of them, slaughtered one another in the 
	streets. Fully armored soldiers fought near-naked warriors, as though half 
	of his people had descended on the other half in their sleep. Skulls were 
	split and limbs were severed. The streets were stained with purple blood.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus studied the action closely. He realized that the 
	reason for the lack of armor on many of the Lugians wasn't that they were 
	surprised in their sleep. When each Lugian met his end, he was promptly 
	resurrected at the lifestone in the corner of the city. Bereft of armor or 
	weapon, that Lugian then leaped back into the fray and resumed his combat.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Was this some form of jest? Were his normally disciplined 
	warriors engaging in mock battles in the streets? Just what was happening 
	here?</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">One of the Lugians, a rather large one who still wore his 
	armor, looked up at Kresovus. He hefted a massive boulder and threw it. Lord 
	Kresovus dropped his axe and caught the rock, its velocity slamming him 
	against the stone wall behind him. Without pausing to catch his breath, he 
	stepped forward and flung the boulder back down at the offending Lugian. The 
	warrior tried to duck out of the way, but Kresovus had anticipated that 
	dodge, and led his target appropriately. The boulder crushed the Lugian's 
	head. His body dropped to the ground.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus looked to the lifestone, waiting for the artifact 
	to resurrect the fallen warrior. He waited several seconds, but nothing 
	happened.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">The Lugian was not resurrected.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus studied the battle again. This time he noticed 
	that each time a naked Lugian fell, he was resurrected at the lifestone. But 
	when an armored Lugian fell, he stayed down.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">This was no mock battle. This was an assault.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Before he had time to process this fact, he heard 
	footsteps pounding their way up the ramps that led to his quarters. Kresovus 
	picked up his axe and readied himself for the attack. He looked to Balor. 
	The Mattekar crouched low to the ground, ready to pounce at any who might 
	attack his lord and master.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus tightened his grip on his axe, listening to the 
	dozens of warriors who were now making their way upwards. Would they be 
	friend or foe? And how would he know the difference?</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">He looked back down at the turmoil below. K'rank - if he 
	could believe that truly was K'rank - swung his axe wildly about, 
	slaughtering a ring of attackers that had descended upon him. Kresovus noted 
	with some satisfaction that K'rank still wore a full suit of armor. No trips 
	to the lifestone for <i>that</i> warrior.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">The pounding footsteps were close now. The attackers were 
	on the ramp below. Kresovus exhaled a long breath and prepared to kill.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">The intruders rounded a bend and showed themselves. They 
	appeared identical to his own Lugians in dress, form, and armament. But 
	there was something about their eyes...</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus's stomach lurched as he recognized the eyes of 
	Shadow. He forced down the fear in his gut and launched forward. Before the 
	infiltrators had time to react, Kresovus cleaved three of them in two, 
	spilling their guts to the floor. A fourth tried to take him as he prepared 
	another strike, but Balor intervened. The Mattekar leapt over his master and 
	crashed into the attacker, sending him flying to the stone floor below.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Dozens more of the impostors raced upwards, brandishing 
	their gleaming axes before them. Kresovus and Balor fought back their 
	attacks, cleaving gray flesh and knocking warriors downward towards their 
	doom. As hard and fast as the intruders pressed, they could not withstand 
	the stalwart defense of the lord of Linvak Tukal.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">When the last of the intruders was dead or gone, Kresovus 
	allowed himself a moment to rest. He bore not one wound, just the aching 
	muscles of battle. He was pleased to see that Balor had fared the same.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">He caught movement on the edge of his vision. Kresovus 
	whipped his head around. The hammer crashed into his face and he fell to the 
	floor.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">He lay on his back, tears in his eyes. He tried to peer up 
	at his attacker, but his vision wavered too greatly. He heard Balor attack. 
	Kresovus hoped that the Mattekar would be able to distract the attacker long 
	enough for Kresovus to regain his footing. But such luck was not to be had. 
	He heard Balor yelp in pain, then grow quiet. Kresovus' heart grew cold.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">He blinked, his head throbbing in pain. He wiped the tears 
	from his eyes and looked up through blurred vision. A gray hulking mass 
	stepped into view.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Kresovus' breath caught in his throat. He looked up at the 
	Lugian. He looked up at <i>himself</i>.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Spring had come earlier than usual. The snows which had so 
	recently appeared were gone just as quickly, though they left behind their 
	frigid chill.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Elysa held her fur-lined robe tightly around her slight 
	frame, bracing herself against the cold air which howled through the open 
	window. Logs crackled and split in the fire behind her, but their heat was 
	not enough to fill this large room.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">She thought such large quarters a trifle ridiculous for a 
	mere two people, especially when she thought of the thousands who were 
	forced to cram their entire lives into small apartments and cottages in the 
	world outside. But after the attack that nearly took her life the year 
	before, Antius had asked her to move into the uppermost room of the castle's 
	tallest tower, and refused to relent on his recommendation no matter how 
	often she protested.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">The thought of her lover brought a smile to her lips. 
	Throughout all the trials of the previous year, he had been the most 
	steadfast and supportive of all her advisors. He had his doubts about 
	Nuhmudira - as did they all - but in the end he agreed with Elysa's decision 
	and did as he we asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;My love, please. You will catch cold over there,&quot; he said 
	from behind her. Elysa turned and looked at him. He stood at the other end 
	of their quarters, resplendent in his gleaming Celdon armor. He held his 
	helm in his hands. He was ready for his journey, and only waited for her 
	command.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Elysa stepped forward. Even just a few paces from the 
	window, the heat of the fire grew immensely. She felt her face flush. &quot;Where 
	will you start?&quot; she asked him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;Yaraq,&quot; he answered. &quot;I could use the warmth.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">She smiled, eager to travel to warmer climes herself. &quot;How 
	do you expect the people to help? If we can't get a word from him, I doubt 
	they can.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">He nodded in agreement. &quot;No, I don't think Carlo will 
	speak to them either. I plan to employ them in another manner.&quot; Antius 
	nodded to the sheaf of papers on Elysa's desk. &quot;That excerpt from his 
	journal... there must be more than that. Doubtless, there are pages 
	scattered all over Osteth. Either on the ground or in the clutches of the 
	creatures who live there. If I can convince the people to work together, 
	perhaps they will uncover something that will provide us with more 
	information than what we have.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;A scavenger hunt,&quot; she grimaced.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;At this point, my Lady, I don't know what else to do,&quot; he 
	replied. &quot;We cannot travel to the northern islands, and Carlo won't speak 
	any more than that gibberish he keeps muttering about 'eating' and 
	'escaping.' I fear that this plan, flawed though it may be, is our best 
	chance.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">She stepped forward and placed her hands on his chest. &quot;I 
	don't disagree with you, Antius. This is the best course of action. I just 
	wish we had more options.&quot; She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him 
	close.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;My Lady,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;I'm just going to Yaraq.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;Yes, I know. But still, I fear. These Lugians that 
	assaulted our vaults, this Viamontian in Rithwic... it seems that no matter 
	how much we fight, some new evil is always just around the corner to 
	threaten our peace.&quot; Elysa relaxed her embrace and looked up at him. &quot;If 
	there are more Viamontians here - if they are in hiding - you must find 
	them. I will not be taken by surprise.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Antius nodded. &quot;I will find them. The people will help me 
	find them.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Elysa smiled, though she had to force herself to do so. 
	&quot;Good. But don't promise them much. After that mess with the Burun, we have 
	few pyreals left in our coffers.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Antius laughed, and Elysa's heart lightened. &quot;I love to 
	hear you laugh, Antius. It has been too long since you had cause to.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;Yes. These last few months... they have been hard.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Elysa stared up at Antius, letting her eyes take in the 
	beauty of his face. Recent events had not allowed her much time to simply 
	stare at him and admire his grace. She took these moments whenever she 
	could, and when they were over, she felt renewed - ready once again to take 
	on the trials of the world.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Suddenly, a terrible thought gripped her heart and pushed 
	aside all feelings of peace and renewal. Though death on Dereth was not to 
	be feared as it was on Ispar, Asheron had not <i>completely</i> defeated it. 
	Her own brush with oblivion had proven that well enough. She knew that each 
	time she sent Antius on one of these missions, he might not return. Such was 
	the risk that all her soldiers took. But for some reason, that fear that she 
	might lose him was much stronger now than usual. He was so precious to her, 
	so much more important than her crown or castle. More important even than 
	the people who swore their loyalty to her. If she were to lose him...</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">Antius seemed to sense her thoughts. He caressed her cheek 
	with a gauntleted hand, then bent down to kiss her. She closed her eyes and 
	let herself fall into that kiss, that kiss which always heralded days apart 
	and nights of uncertainty. She drank in the taste of him and wrapped her 
	fingers through his thick, brown hair. She kissed him as though she might 
	never get the chance to do so again, and let him do the same.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">When they parted, she stepped away from him and tightened 
	her robe around herself once more. She had had her kiss. The time for 
	passion was at an end. She was no longer lover to the man, but Queen to the 
	warrior.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;Go,&quot; she commanded. &quot;Go, and find out what evil threatens 
	my realm.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;Yes,&quot; he bowed. &quot;I will return soon, my Queen.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2">&quot;See that you do,&quot; she replied.</font></p>

	<p>Urleg kicked the wounded Mattekar into the cell, then slammed the iron

	them in their stone moorings. &quot;We cannot keep it here,&quot; Urleg growled. &quot;This

	<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Amaroth agreed. &quot;He will be here soon. The beast will be his

	<p>Urleg hefted a boulder, then looked to his brother. &quot;Shoktok is in

	<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Amaroth, taking up his own weapon. &quot;As should we be. No

	<span lang="en-us"><font size="2">From Ibn regarding 
	the February LttP:<br>
	</font></span><font size="2"><br>
	I just wanted to post that the February LttP is going to be a little late 
	this month, it won't be going up until the end of this week at the earliest.<br>
	<br>
	Currently the February event, Infiltration, is tentatively scheduled for 
	Wednesday, February 9.<br>
	<br>
	For right now, I can give you a brief tease of some of the changes and new 
	stuff coming in the February event!<br>
	<br>
	- Two more tiers of higher wield-req loot weapons for melee weapons, missile 
	weapons and casters.<br>
	<br>
	- New Darktide-only dungeons -- within these dungeons are an opportunity for 
	very rapid advancement from level 20 up to level 109... if your fellow 
	players can't prevent you from getting to it!<br>
	<br>
	- An unseasonable thaw is coming... the snow is melting and snowmen and 
	scarecrows will disappear from the landscape spawns.<br>
	<br>
	- The buy cap of all vendors in the three Social Center towns (Holtburg, 
	Shoushi, Yaraq) is being increased from 25,000 pyreals to 1,000,000 pyreals.<br>
	<br>
	- Many of the outlying landscape spawns in the Withered Atoll have had the 
	number of creatures reduced. In addition, Tumeroks in the Withered Atoll 
	will no longer spawn wielding shields. Both these changes were made based on 
	player feedback, and these are not the only improvements to the Atoll that 
	we are working on.<br>
	<br>
	These are all in addition to the new content, quests and items that we're 
	introducing in February. We'll have more details in the February Letter!<br>

    From 
    the<span lang="en-us">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=348">Turbine AC Site</a> - 
	Feb. 8, 2005</span></font><p>Welcome to the February Letter to the Players! 
	Last month in Dereth, unsolicited aid turned sinister. The Lugians who had 
	aided Isparians by constructing Crafting Forges in Holtburg, Shoushi and 
	Yaraq were seen leading monstrous assault troops in an attempt to steal an 
	ancient magical relic. Who are these Lugians; why did they first aid us and 
	then attack us? As Dereth begins to experience an unseasonable thaw, the 
	scarecrows and snowmen no longer wander the landscape. In the new warmth, 
	adventurers seek answers.</p>
	<p>By now you've probably seen Executive Producer Jessica Mulligan's
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=347">
	most recent Letter</a>. (If not, go read it. We'll be here when you get 
	back.) As she stated, the Asheron's Call team is dedicating all of its 
	resources to making sure that the <i>Asheron's Call: Throne of Destiny</i> 
	expansion pack is as awesome as we know it can be. Unfortunately, this means 
	that February's event will be the last Live Monthly Event until after <i>
	Throne of Destiny</i>'s launch in the second quarter of this year. </p>
	<p>For this reason, there is no <b>In-Development</b> or <b>In-Concept</b> 
	section in this Letter. All of our designers, artists and engineers are hard 
	at work on <i>Throne of Destiny</i>. As the launch date approaches, we'll 
	revisit our priorities and resources for the Live monthly events, and come 
	back to you with our plans for the months ahead.</p>
	<p>For right now, let's take a look at what's coming next week in the 
	February event!</p>
	</font><font face="arial">
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>Coming Soon</b></div>
	</font><font size="2" face="arial">
	<p><i>(These are items that we plan to implement in the February event. Many 
	of these items were mentioned in prior articles. These changes are in 
	addition to the new quests, dungeons and items that we'll be introducing in 
	the January event.)</i></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Higher Wield-Req Weapons</b></div>
	<p>Coming closely on the heels of last month's new higher wield-req weapons 
	are two new tiers of weapons found in loot! These will include:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Melee weapons with wield requirements of 370 and 400.
		</li>
		<li>Missile weapons with wield requirements of 335 and 360.
		</li>
		<li>Casters with wield requirements of 330 and 355.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These weapons will be found in the highest tier of treasure; this is the 
	treasure found on creatures found in the Valley of Death, Singularity Caul 
	and Withered Atoll; as well as the most challenging creatures in the West 
	Direlands and the Obsidian Plains. This treasure can also be found in other 
	ways as well, including some new surprises we've got for you in this month's 
	event!</p>
	<p>The missile weapons and casters will have elemental bonuses rather than 
	increased base damage, similar to the weapons introduced in January.</p>
	<p>Each additional tier of weapons has an average damage-over-time increase 
	of 5% when compared to the preceding tier. To clarify, this is a comparison 
	of <i>damage-over-time</i>, not base damage. DOT calculations take into 
	account multiple factors such as speed of attack and damage bonuses from 
	base attributes and (in some cases) attack skill. In addition, the 5% is an 
	average across all weapons – some weapon classes may have a greater or 
	lesser improvement depending on their current DOT.</p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Mausoleums of Hate</b></div>
	<p>As discussed in the <b>In-Development</b> section of the January Letter 
	to the Players, in February we will be introducing a set of tiered dungeons 
	specifically for the PvP world of Darktide. These dungeons will have 
	multiple entrances scattered across Dereth, and deep within them one can 
	find a means of very rapid character advancement. Those who want to quickly 
	reach a more competitive level of PvP combat should seek out these 
	Mausoleums; those who wish to prevent their foes from quickly advancing 
	should also seek them out, if only to defend the Pillars and Effigies within 
	from being used!</p>
	<p>The initial tiers of these dungeons span a range of levels from 20 to 
	109. Based on player use and feedback, we are working on plans for higher 
	tiers after the launch of <i>Throne of Destiny</i>.</p>
	<p>As we have said in the past, these dungeons are intended to benefit the 
	unique gameplay environment on Darktide. Those who seek to test their skills 
	against other players are drawn to Darktide, and they want an opportunity to 
	level the playing field so skill alone is the deciding factor in battle. The 
	Mausoleums of Hate can assist those who can survive within.</p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Withered Atoll Revisions</b></div>
	<p>Based on your feedback, we have made two changes to the Withered Atoll 
	for February:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>We've decreased the number of creatures in some of the outlying 
		spawns. This is intended to help those players who are on the very edge 
		of being able to fight effectively in the Atoll and are trying to pull 
		one or two creatures away from the pack. The large camps have not been 
		changed.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Tumeroks in the Atoll will no longer spawn with shields.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These are not the only changes that we would like to make to the Atoll; 
	however further changes will need to wait until Live Events start up again 
	after <i>Throne of Destiny</i>'s launch.</p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Social Center Vendor Revisions</b></div>
	<p>As part of our ongoing work on the three Social Center towns – Holtburg, 
	Shoushi and Yaraq – we will be increasing the buy cap on all vendors in 
	these towns. The vendors will now purchase items up to 1,000,000 pyreals. So 
	when you're done hunting, swing by a social center to sell off your excess 
	loot. Who knows what someone else might've sold just before you.</p>
	</font><font face="arial">
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>In-Concept</b></div>
	</font><font size="2" face="arial">
	<p>As we've said in the past, all topics previously listed as <b>In-Concept</b> 
	are still on the table for discussion unless otherwise noted in a previous 
	Letter. We've got a lot of plans for improvements to the game even in 
	addition to the fantastic stuff coming in <i>Throne of Destiny</i>!</p>
	<p>And there you have it, the changes coming in the February event. As I 
	said, we'll be coming back to you with our plans for the next Live Event 
	well in advance, and your feedback and suggestions are always valuable. </p>
	<p>While you're exploring the new February content, be sure to take part in 
	one of the regular Live Events being run by our new Live Event Operators, or 
	+LEOs! Whether you're tasked to chase down a prison escapee or cook a 
	particular type of cake, you never know what you might get as a reward.</p>
	<p>See you in Dereth!<span class="Title2"><font size="2"><br>

    Inc., a premier provider of online subscription entertainment, today 
    announced that it has launched a member rewards program as a way to say 
    &quot;thank you&quot; to its dedicated and passionate online games service members.&nbsp; 
    The new member rewards program, which went live on Tuesday, Feb. 15, 2005,

    opportunity to become eligible for future Turbine beta testing programs 
    before the general public.</p>
    <p>&quot;Turbine Member Rewards is a great way for us to show our appreciation to 
    the thousands of players who immerse themselves in Turbine's online worlds,&quot; 
    said Jeffrey Anderson, president and CEO, Turbine, Inc.&nbsp; &quot;We want to reward

    see and try out the new worlds that we produce.&quot;</p>
    <p><b>How it Works:</b></p>
    <p>Members of a Turbine service, such as <b><i>Asheron's Call<sup>®</sup>
    </i></b>or <b><i>Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings<sup>®</sup></i></b>, may 
    register for the program via a link on their service profile page. Prior to 
    an upcoming beta program's &quot;open&quot; phase, Turbine will create a pool of 
    eligible members from those who registered and meet Turbine's criteria.&nbsp; 
    From this pool, select members will be invited to participate in a pending 
    game beta.&nbsp; Members who are not selected for play testing will remain in the 
    pool and could be selected for later beta activities or opportunities.</p>
    <p><b>Program Requirements: </b></p>
    <p>To qualify for the Turbine Member Rewards program, members must be 
    registered for a Turbine world through the company's new billing system.&nbsp; In 
    addition, they must be actively subscribed to at least one Turbine service 
    for at least six consecutive months in good standing. </p>
    <p>If members have more than one eligible service account, such as a 
    subscription to both AC and AC2, each account is eligible for its own 
    program membership.</p>

	<font face="Arial">Q. How do I join Turbine’s beta rewards program?</font></p>
    </font>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. The 
    beta rewards are a benefit we offer to our most loyal customers. To join you 
    will need to be actively subscribed to a Turbine game. To be eligible for 
    one of our betas through this program, you will need to be a member in the 
    program for six consecutive months in good standing.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. Six 
    months! Why the wait?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. Two 
    reasons. First, this program is a “thank you” from Turbine to customers who 
    have been loyal to our current games – we want to give them an opportunity 
    to be among the first to see our new titles. Second, it tends to keep out 
    the riff-raff. We may change the requirements from time to time or offer 
    special guaranteed beta seats through promotions. If we do, it’ll be 
    announced separately.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. Can I 
    pay for a spot in a beta?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. No. 
    We do not sell access to our betas at this time. This program is purely 
    intended as a benefit to our customers.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. Can I 
    sign up for <i>Game X</i>’s beta today?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. No. 
    The beta rewards program doesn’t allow you to sign up for a specific beta, 
    but is designed so that you can be chosen to participate in Turbine-selected 
    beta programs for all Turbine titles. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. Which 
    upcoming games are covered in this program?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. 
    Pretty much any publicly announced Turbine project will be eligible for 
    inclusion in the beta rewards program. Details about each game’s beta 
    inclusion will be announced as that game nears beta.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. If 
    I’m a member of the beta rewards program do I get a guaranteed spot in the 
    next Turbine beta?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. No. 
    Membership grants you the opportunity to be selected before the general 
    public for certain betas. You’ll still need to satisfy the beta requirements 
    to actually participate in any specific beta.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. Why 
    do I have to fill out the beta profile?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. In 
    order to make sure our beta tests are comprehensive and accurate, we need to 
    have many different types of players and systems represented at various 
    stages of the test cycle. We have quotas for each category, and will 
    populate a given beta by selecting players who match specific requirements. 
    Your completed profile allows us to make these selections. Without a profile 
    you cannot join a beta.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. I 
    haven’t been asked to fill out a profile. When will that happen?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. Beta 
    profiles will be offered before the next scheduled beta to program members 
    in good standing.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. <i>
    Game X</i> is in beta and I haven’t been invited, but my friend (who isn’t 
    even in the program) got in. What gives?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. We 
    have detailed needs for each stage of beta. While we will do our best to 
    select as many players as possible from the beta rewards program, we may 
    need to select some beta members from outside the program to satisfy 
    specific requirements.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">Q. <i>
    Game X</i> has been in beta for months and I haven’t gotten in yet. Will I 
    ever?</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="Arial">A. 
    Maybe. The complete beta process for a modern MMO can run to a year or more. 
    During that time we will build an increasingly large pool of players, and 
    may even rotate players in and out of the beta. In spite of all that 
    activity, there still may not be enough beta slots to let everyone in.<br>

		Our investigation of the server-side lag on Darktide has not 
		conclusively proven that the Mausoelums and/or the OTIS macro are the 
		cause of the server-side lag that has been experienced recently. However 
		we did find some additional corrolating evidence. <br>
		<br>
		The next step is to shut the Mausoleums down and watch the resulting 
		server status. <br>
		<br>
		All worlds will be brought down for scheduled hardware maintenance 
		tomorrow at 6AM PDT / 9AM EDT. In addition to this maintenance, at this 
		time the Mausoleums on Darktide will be shut down. No player will be 
		able to enter the dungeons as the Gatekeepers will disappear from 
		landscape. In addition the Pillars and Effigies will disappear from the 
		dungeons. <br>
		<br>
		It is very important to note that after the worlds come down for 
		maintenance tomorrow you will <i>not be able to recover any corpses 
		inside the Mausoleums</i>.<br>
		<br>
		It is also important to keep in mind that even if the servers are fine 
		and the lag disappears after tomorrow's maintenance, that is not proof 
		that the Mausoleums and/or the OTIS macro were the cause. It's entirely 
		possible that there's something else going on that was resolved by the 
		server restart.<br>
		<br>
		Also to note: If the lag reoccurs after the Mausoleums are shut down, we 
		do not plan on turning them back on until we conclusively pin down and 
		resolve the true cause.<br>
		<br>
		We want to thank the members of the Darktide community who have helped 
		us investigate this issue, and we thank everyone for your patience as we 
		work to resolve the problem.</div>
