    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The cold black walls were home. There was no 
    other explanation for the warmth that spread through him. Since Kaedrix had 
    made him aware that the Virindi were leaving the home of his Lord, the 
    Mirror had wanted to see the halls, the halls of Bael'Zharon, the Hopeslayer, 
    the most fearsome entity that this world had ever known. His Lord. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A thin black smile stretched across his 
    shadowy face, and his children began leaving him. They pulled themselves 
    from his body and swarmed along the walls, into the shadows and along the 
    floor. The children giggled and danced and played, as all good children 
    should. Finally, he was home. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Virindi had not been to this depth. They 
    had not violated the sanctity of the deepest temple. Here he had stood so 
    long ago with his Lord and the other chosen, performing rites to call the 
    black breath to scourge the world and bring about the destruction of it all.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The children suddenly stopped dancing and 
    giggling. Playtime was done; now the air grew colder as the Mirror's eyes 
    blazed and spilled red across the ebon floor. The thin smile turned to a 
    dark scowl and the crown atop his head spilled shadowy fumes about him. The 
    children gathered into a circle on the floor, sitting in silence—no, not 
    silence, reverence. The Mirror made his way to an altar set into the wall. A 
    basin filled with bubbling black blood was set within the stone and lit from 
    above by some spectral form of crimson light. Here was the place it would 
    begin again.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The children waited expectantly. The Mirror 
    dipped a shadowy hand into the blood and lifted it to his lips. As he drank, 
    strength flowed through him once more. Power flooded into his arms and his 
    eyes burned brighter, flooding the cavern with radiant light he looked up to 
    the ceiling…there, gathered and huddled in the darkness, were thousands of 
    sleeping forms. The Mirror turned his attention to the children who waited, 
    so patiently, such good children. They deserved a reward. They deserved a 
    story.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Such precious children, obedient and silent. 
    You have earned a story, children. But this story is unlike any other I have 
    told you, for you shall live it.&quot; His hand dipped into the blood again, but 
    this time his fingers extended, etching symbols onto the wall behind the 
    altar. &quot;It begins before the coming of our new Lord, when the world was dark 
    with rain and the Black Breath reached to cleanse the Lightbringer's blight. 
    It was then that our Lord, our First Lord, asked me of children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Such a painful wound on the mind, heart and 
    soul of our Lord, as his own son had been taken from him. But still he spoke 
    to me of children, asking how to teach them and speak to them as I had done. 
    How to love children as I did, and how to mold them in his own image.&quot; The 
    Mirror drew the face of his master in the blood and then a smaller form 
    beside him. The images took on a ghostly white sheen and began to move about 
    one another. &quot;My master could not have the children he wanted, so I made 
    children from him and for him.&quot; The images danced and combined, then parted, 
    splitting into several small winged outlines. The Mirror smiled. &quot;Now it is 
    time for Ler Rhan to revisit his master's children and wake them from their 
    slumber. Would you children like to help?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The small shadow forms nodded their heads in 
    unison and Ler Rhan, the Mirror, smiled once again. Tendrils of darkness 
    began pouring from his mouth and from the top of his crown. A web-work 
    stretched over his children, reaching to the top of the giant cavern and 
    touching the motionless forms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Such good children. Take his blood, take the 
    blood of my master, and feed his children. We shall wake them and then we 
    shall take what is ours.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The children clamored one by one, by the 
    tens, the hundreds, then by the thousands to carry the black blood through 
    the webs to the cavern's ceiling. There, they dripped the viscous liquid 
    into sleeping mouths and fled to the safety of the floor below. Ler Rhan 
    cast his red gaze toward the ceiling and marveled as the forms started 
    moving. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Good children, good.&quot; The tendrils retreated 
    into his form and the children began clapping, leaping, dancing and playing 
    again. The first Margul descended and landed before Ler Rhan. He bowed his 
    head to the little creature and it spoke. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Where is father?&quot; It tilted its head to the 
    side. &quot;We awake and do not feel his call.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Father is…resting.&quot; Ler Rhan responded and 
    the children hushed. The little creature looked to the ceiling and his 
    brethren. It looked back to Ler Rhan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We remember you. You are the Creator. You 
    are the teacher, and despoiler. We shall serve as father wishes.&quot; It bowed 
    low, pulling its wings about it as it did. Ler Rhan nodded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We have much to do.&quot; His shadowy children, 
    staring in awe, began crawling toward him, toward the little creature. 
    &quot;These are my children. There are many others coming, children of the new 
    master. They will arrive soon and then we take the land above and claim it 
    once again.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The little creature bowed its head again. It 
    let out a call and above Ler Rhan thousands of wings began flapping and 
    cries echoed through the cavernous halls. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Aerbax, the children of the Hopeslayer 
    are wakened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Excellent. Continue with your efforts and 
    rend the land asunder, drive out those who cling to the ideals of the 
    Quiddity, and loose my children on the world. Take back the home of your 
    former master. Let me rest, the transformation is far from complete.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you wish, Lord Aerbax.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Go!&quot; Ler Rhan commanded. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Through twisting tunnels and marred 
    underworld, through darkness and dampness they flew. To the surface, 
    spreading like plague. Seeking a singular prey with efficient cruelty unseen 
    to this world in millennia. Claw, tooth, spell and breath ripped and 
    shredded the remaining forces of the Quiddity. They delved into strongholds 
    built over long silenced geysers and tunnels of flame. As the purge neared 
    its end, Ler Rhan gathered his children close and brought them all back 
    within his body, one by one.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ayan Baqur saw it first: a black pillar 
    billowing far to the southwest. It rose into the sky and threatened to block 
    out the sun. The black pillar cleared and the ground shook as a wave 
    approached the shore of the direlands. Water rose as the wave crashed just 
    below the edge of the city and dragged the creatures on the western coast 
    into the sea. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the waves ceased to crash they saw them: 
    teeth that rose toward the sky. The mountains of the island in the southwest 
    had risen to be like knives. The island was changed and only the heartiest 
    and most adventurous would dare travel there now.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While this transpired in the west, High Queen 
    Elysa approved the work of the council in enhancing the methods of 
    communications within monarchies. The work of months came to fruition as all 
    sworn to her could speak amongst themselves at last.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Sho town of Shoushi saw the first of her 
    improvements as a lifestone was anchored in the center of the town. Asheron 
    and Nuhmudira remained apart from the endeavor. The work instead fell to 
    Shoyanen Kenchu, Master of the Right Hand, who also completed the task of 
    reworking the portal space beacon. The town saw an increased interest from 
    the bestial inhabitants of Dereth, their curiosity piqued by the attention 
    the town received. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Ongoing Saga</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The High Queen continues her work with the 
    same intensity that she has shown since awakening from her coma. As the 
    newly restructured High Council sits down to business, the eruption of 
    darkness in the southwest reminds all that Dereth still has many dangers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now let’s take a look at some of the changes 
    coming in this month’s event.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Content Revisions</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we’ve hinted all month, the Singularity 
    Caul and many of the quests associated with it have been revised. Hopefully 
    you took our warning to heart and didn’t leave any characters logged off on 
    the Caul, otherwise they may be in for a nasty fall, followed by an 
    encounter with some of its new inhabitants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, we’ve revised much of the 
    content around the starter town of Shoushi, rebalancing and tweaking where 
    we felt it was necessary. Over time, we plan on retouching all of the older 
    towns in this manner, as well as making other changes and improvements to 
    make them more fun and valuable to spend time in.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Fellowship XP</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the December event, we made a change to 
    the location of the Marketplace to prevent players from gaining fellowship 
    XP while trading or idling there. In the December Rollout Article, we said, 
    “We intend to fix the code that allows fellowship XP to be shared between 
    players who are not in the same dungeon.” This month, we’ve made good on 
    that intention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of this event, you will no longer receive 
    fellowship XP from fellowship members:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If they are indoors while you are 
      outdoors, or vice-versa.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are both indoors but in different 
      landblocks.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Indoors” means inside a dungeon, or inside a 
    building or cave on the surface. As almost all dungeons are in different 
    landblocks, this means that you can no longer gain fellowship XP if you are 
    in a different dungeon than the rest of your fellowship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, we have decreased the maximum 
    distance between fellowship members at which you can share fellowship XP. In 
    the past, you could be about 8 map units away from each other and still 
    receive full fellowship XP. (8 map units is the distance between 0.0N, 0.0W, 
    and 8.0N, 0.0W.) After that, the amount that you receive would decrease 
    slowly. For example, you could be about 48 map units away—approximately the 
    distance between Lytelthorpe and Al-Jalima—and still receive 50% of 
    fellowship XP.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting with this event, you must be within 
    a little less than 2.5 map units to receive 100% of fellowship XP. After 
    that it will drop off quickly—when you are more than 5 map units away from 
    your fellows, your fellowship XP will be at 0%.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These changes are intended to reinforce the 
    design of fellowships as groups of allied players, working together either 
    in hunting or questing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>PK/L Radar Blips</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We listened to the negative feedback that we 
    received regarding the PK/L radar blip changes that were made in the 
    November 2003 event. To improve the ability to correctly identify friend 
    from foe, as well as determine the number of possible opponents, we’re 
    making the following tweaks:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Threat blips—the X’s—have been made 
      smaller so that they no longer overlap in confusing ways. They are now the 
      same size as the standard blips.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allegiance threat blips—the X’s on top of 
      squares—have been removed as they did not have the intended effect. 
      Allegiance members are squares, no matter what their PK/L status may be.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Max Mana Spells</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are several spells in the game that 
    either increase or decrease a player’s maximum mana. Many of these spells 
    did not stack properly. This has now been fixed. Spells that increase or 
    decrease your maximum mana should now stack based on the amount of their 
    effect. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here’s an example of how things should work 
    now: If you have two spells cast on you, one which increases your maximum 
    mana by 50 and one which decreases your maximum mana by 20, your total 
    increase should be 30. If you then had another spell cast on you that 
    increased your maximum mana by 80, it would override the increase of 50, and 
    you would have a total increase of 60.</font></p>

    2004! This will be a very exciting and challenging year for <em>Asheron's 
    Call</em>. Hopefully by now you've seen the announcement that Turbine is 
    purchasing the <em>Asheron's Call </em>franchise from Microsoft. If you've 
    missed that somehow, just check out the announcements on Turbine's
    <a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/" target="_blank">Asheron's Call</a> 
    website.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One thing that you'll be seeing more of in 
    the next few months is information from us. In addition to updates regarding 
    the transition of services from Microsoft to Turbine, we'll have more 
    information from the Live Team regarding where the game is and where it's 
    going. Some of these articles will be questions that we ask you, the fans, 
    similar to our PK Lite request for feedback. Other articles won't focus as 
    much on questions, but will be more like informal essays about our plans and 
    goals for various game mechanics and content. We look forward to sharing our 
    ideas with you, and we know we'll get a lot of great feedback either way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Things have been equally as busy in Dereth. 
    To the surprise of many, High Queen Elysa Strathelar awoke from her coma 
    with a new drive and determination. The High Council has been restructured, 
    and Nuhmudira is no longer a member. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many have sought the identity of the High 
    Queen's would-be assassin and have been well-rewarded for their efforts. 
    Meanwhile, the Undead fight the Olthoi deep in the bowels of Dereth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is a new year both in our world and in 
    Dereth, and this new year brings many changes. We believe you'll be very 
    excited about them—we know we are!</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" size="2">Allegiance Chat</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the January event, we'll be introducing a 
    feature that many of you have been asking about for some time—server-wide 
    allegiance chat!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our initial implementation of allegiance chat 
    is very straightforward—if I am in an allegiance, and I type <em>@a Hi!</em> 
    or <em>/a Hi!</em>, all the members of my allegiance will see <em>
    [Allegiance] Ibn says, &quot;Hi!&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are in an allegiance, you will be 
    added into your allegiance chat channel as soon as you log in. If you aren't 
    in an allegiance, you'll be added as soon as you swear to a patron, or have 
    someone swear to you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you do not wish to see Allegiance chat, 
    type @filter –allegiance, just as you would for any other message type. When 
    you want to see it again, type @unfilter –allegiance. If you @squelch a 
    character, you will no longer see that character's speech in Allegiance 
    chat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We plan to add a number of additional 
    features to Allegiance chat, as time permits. For example, currently there 
    is no way for a monarch to remove someone from the Allegiance chat channel 
    other than removing that character from the allegiance completely. We hope 
    to introduce that feature, as well as other options, shortly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're also very excited about other possible 
    uses for this technology. Zyrca, srand, and Gator – our server 
    engineer—worked very hard to make this possible, and it creates a number of 
    opportunities. You should see more information from us on this soon.</font></p>
    <h4><font face="Arial" size="2">January Event Delayed</font></h4>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, those are two bits of good news...here's 
    the bad news. You will have to wait a little longer than expected to get 
    these two new features, as well as the rest of the great content we have 
    planned for the January event. We are moving our event date back in order to 
    allow for the <em>Asheron's Call 1</em> server datacenter move, currently 
    planned for January 20 through January 23.&nbsp; (Click
    <a href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=695" target="_blank">
    here</a> for more information on the move.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You might be thinking, &quot;Why not just make the 
    January event live during the move downtime?&quot; This is something that we did 
    consider. However, we want to make sure that the worlds are running normally 
    after the move before we make any changes to them. To that end, the January 
    event is now currently scheduled for Tuesday, January 27.</font></p>

    <span class="Title2"><font size="2">To Our Players,<br>
    <br>
    As of February 1, 2004, the monthly subscription rate for <u>Asheron’s Call® 
    1</u> and <u>Asheron’s Call®: Dark Majesty™</u>, will increase from $9.95 
    per month to $12.95 per month. This price increase will be reflected on your 
    March subscription bill.<br>
    <br>
    Turbine’s decision to raise the price is an essential, but difficult one. 
    Since its launch in 1999, the <u>Asheron’s Call®</u> monthly subscription 
    rate has remained unchanged. In fact, <u>Asheron’s Call 1</u> is the last 
    major massively-multiplayer game in North America to charge $9.95 per month. 
    However, the costs of running a large-scale MMP have continued to rise. In 
    order for us to continue running and growing the service, we need to 
    recognize the reality to the times and likewise raise this subscription fee. 
    The price increase is a necessary step.<br>
    <br>
    As a sign of our commitment to growing the community, we will be opening a 
    new <u>Asheron’s Call 1®</u> world in the Spring. The exact timing will be 
    announced at a later date, as we proceed with the transition of the service 
    to Turbine and have a better idea of just how soon we can make it happen.<br>

    <font size="2">For some time now, bringing up the topic of allegiance 
    experience (XP) in an Asheron’s Call discussion forum has been an excellent 
    way of starting a flame war. There are those who have passionately 
    campaigned for a change to the system, and there are those who have just as 
    passionately defended it.<br>
    <br>
    In this article, I’ll be explaining why the Live Team believes that the 
    system should be changed. I’ll also be explaining what changes we plan on 
    making as well as the expected impact of these changes on your characters 
    and the community.<br>
    <br>
    I’m sure that one of your first questions is, Why now? Why make a change to 
    a key system of the game four years after release?<br>
    <br>
    There are many reasons why we’ve decided to go forward with this change. The 
    most important is that we believe it is in the best interests of Asheron’s 
    Call in the long term. Asheron’s Call still has a long future ahead of it! 
    There are some who might say, “It’s too late for this change to make any 
    difference.” However if you look at it from another perspective, the last 
    four years have been just the beginning of AC’s lifespan.<br>
    <br>
    We also believe that the recent creature rebalancing has removed a lot of 
    the tedious “level grinding” in the upper levels. Allegiance experience used 
    to provide a helping hand past these boring levels, but with more high level 
    quests, better high level creatures, and more opportunities to earn 
    appropriate experience rewards at high levels while actively playing the 
    game, allegiance experience is no longer quite so necessary for this 
    purpose. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, as Jessica announced earlier this week we plan to open a new 
    world in the Spring. This creates a great opportunity for us to open this 
    world with the new system firmly in place.<br>
    <br>
    Our plans call for this system to go live as part of the February event.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3"><b>The Original Goals<br>
    </b></font><font size="2"><br>
    When Asheron’s Call launched, there were three initial goals for the 
    allegiance system:<br>
    <br>
    Create an incentive for high-level players to assist low-level players via 
    the patron-vassal relationship.<br>
    Provide a framework for a social game experience.<br>
    Add to the atmosphere and background of the game.<br>
    A system of allegiance experience, or “pass-up”, was designed to create 
    in-game incentives to help meet these goals. As vassals gained experience, 
    their patrons would also gain XP. The XP “passed up” was based on the amount 
    of experience gained by the vassal, and modified by a number of factors such 
    as the Loyalty of the vassal and the Leadership of the patron. The patron 
    would then pass a percentage of this XP up to his patron, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    This provided an incentive for experienced players to assist new players. 
    The experienced players could provide the new players with equipment, 
    advice, and aid, and would gain experience as their vassals advanced. As 
    folks banded together under this system, they created allegiances and a 
    whole social dynamic. <br>
    <br>
    Simple, right?<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3"><b>Problems with the System<br>
    </b></font><font size="2"><br>
    As the AC player base matured, folks began to figure out exactly how to use 
    the allegiance XP system to get the maximum experience return. There were 
    several problems with the initial system.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Skill Issues<br>
    </b><br>
    To a casual observer of this system, going by the in-game documentation, it 
    would appear that the best way for a vassal to increase pass-up to a patron 
    is to increase his or her Loyalty skill. Likewise, the best way for a patron 
    to increase pass-up from his or vassals is to train and put XP into 
    Leadership.<br>
    <br>
    However, as many of you have learned, this is not necessarily the case. <br>
    <br>
    There are a number of other factors that contribute to a character’s 
    effective Loyalty and Leadership. The effective Leadership and Loyalty skill 
    levels are the numbers that are actually used in allegiance experience 
    calculation. <br>
    <br>
    For example, it is possible to increase your effective Loyalty by spending 
    more time in-game sworn to the same patron. Vassal-to-patron pass-up has no 
    effective cap, but patron-to-grandpatron pass-up caps with an effective 
    Loyalty of 175. If you’re sworn for 10 days to the same patron, the base 
    Loyalty required to maximize the pass-up from your vassal through you to 
    your patron is only 88. Take into account level 7 enchantments, and you can 
    see how there’s practically no need to spend XP on the skill, due to the 
    ease in reaching the cap.<br>
    <br>
    Leadership is arguably worse off. In theory, you need to train Leadership 
    and spend XP on it in order to get maximum results. However, effective 
    Leadership is multiplied by two factors – how many vassals you have, and how 
    long they have been sworn to you, with the emphasis on the number of vassals 
    you have. The effect of Leadership on pass-up caps at around 165 effective 
    Leadership – 83 base Leadership before the modifier.<br>
    <br>
    The end result of this is that if you have two active vassals and you can 
    get 10 mules sworn underneath you for an average of 5 in-game days, you 
    never need to raise your Leadership beyond 83. Again, take into account 
    level 7 enchantments and you can see why few people even bother training the 
    skill. It’s just too easy to reach the cap.<br>
    <br>
    Clearly, these two skills should have value beyond what they have now.<br>
    <br>
    And there is one other issue with the Loyalty and Leadership skills. As both 
    of these skills are based on the Self attribute, and since magic-using 
    characters tend to start with a higher Self and put more XP into increasing 
    it, magic-using characters tend to have higher Leadership and Loyalty than 
    other characters. When considered from the point of view of XP pass-up, the 
    entire system appears biased towards mages.<br>
    <br>
    <b>“Chain” XP<br>
    </b><br>
    This is generally perceived to the biggest problem with the system. To put 
    it simply, the mathematics of the system means that multiple characters can 
    generate an extraordinary amount of XP very quickly by maximizing pass-up 
    and having all members of the allegiance sworn into a straight line from 
    monarch to lowest-level vassal.<br>
    <br>
    As an example, imagine a chain of ten characters. A is sworn to B, B is 
    sworn to C, C is sworn to D, and so on up to J. All ten players have 
    optimized their characters for maximum pass-up, something that is not 
    particularly difficult to do, as I demonstrated previously.<br>
    <br>
    In this situation, if A earns 1 million XP, B will receive around 440,000 
    XP. That’s not a whole lot, really. But then C will receive around 400,000 
    XP, D will receive around 390,000, and so on up the chain. After the initial 
    vassal-to-patron step, each additional step provides only slightly less XP 
    than the step before it. After a full nine steps, J is still receiving over 
    300,000 XP. With only ten characters involved, the allegiance system by 
    itself will create over 3 million XP in addition to the 1 million that A 
    earned! This only increases as you add more characters to the chain. A chain 
    of 30 characters can multiply that initial 1 million into an additional 6 
    million, just by existing! And, of course, these figures ignore the insane 
    accumulation of experience that can result when all 30 of those characters 
    are themselves actively earning XP.<br>
    <br>
    This compounding of experience has a number of side-effects, the most 
    obvious being rapid advancement. This makes balancing the game more 
    difficult and can actually lead to boredom, as players level past content 
    that should have kept them busy for awhile. In addition, many of our players 
    see this rapid advancement as being unfair to those who do not use this 
    system. They feel as though they are trapped between a rock and a hard place 
    – they must either use this system or be “left behind”.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Side Effects<br>
    </b><br>
    While many allegiances have chosen not to restructure to take best advantage 
    of the XP pass-up system, the lure is always present. Many allegiances have 
    lost valued members to the call of free and easy XP. Many (although 
    certainly not all) “Chain” allegiances are XP-producing machines with none 
    of the patron-to-vassal aid or other social structures of the allegiance as 
    it was envisioned by the original designers.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, the impact on player morale has been noticeable. Many players 
    feel upset or cheated when they have worked hard to achieve a high level in 
    the game, and others reach that same level on the back of an XP chain. <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3"><b>Our Goals<br>
    </b></font><font size="2"><br>
    We had three goals in mind when considering this system for revision:<br>
    <br>
    Increase the value of the direct patron-vassal relationship.<br>
    Reduce the sheer amount of experience produced by XP chains. <br>
    Make experience spent on Leadership and Loyalty more valuable.<br>
    The primary strength of the allegiance system lies in the direct 
    patron-vassal relationship. While there is obviously also value in the 
    vassal-grandpatron relationship, and particularly in the relationship 
    between the monarch and all of the monarch’s followers, we believe that the 
    emphasis for experience pass-up should be the direct vassal-patron 
    relationship. <br>
    <br>
    </font><b><font size="3">The New System<br>
    </font><font size="2"><br>
    Leadership and Loyalty<br>
    </font></b><font size="2"><br>
    The largest change that we are making to these skills is that they will no 
    longer inherit part of their skill levels from the level of your Self 
    attribute. In fact, these skills will no longer be based on any attribute at 
    all! The only way to raise these skills will be to invest experience into 
    each skill directly. <br>
    <br>
    Effective Loyalty will still be modified by the time you have spent sworn to 
    your patron. Effective Leadership will still be modified by number of 
    vassals and average time that they have been sworn to you, but the emphasis 
    will be on the “time sworn” side and not on the “number of vassals” side. In 
    fact, the vassals required to achieve the maximum benefit will be decreased 
    from 12 to 4. This is to reduce the incentive to have non-playing vassals.
    <br>
    <br>
    For both Loyalty and Leadership, the time sworn modifier will now be a 
    factor of both in-game time and real time. Existing patron-vassal 
    relationships will start with the same bonus that they are currently 
    receiving. For example, if you have been sworn to your patron for enough 
    time to receive 50% of the maximum benefit, you will still receive 50% of 
    the maximum benefit when the new system is implemented.<br>
    <br>
    Most importantly, Leadership and Loyalty will no longer “cap”. That is, for 
    every point you raise Leadership or Loyalty skills by investing experience 
    into them, you will continue to see a benefit in terms of experience 
    pass-up. <br>
    <br>
    <b>XP Pass-up<br>
    </b><br>
    This is where we are making the greatest changes. In a nutshell, these are 
    the new minimums and maximums:<br>
    <br>
    Vassal-to-patron pass-up will have a minimum of 25% of earned XP, and a 
    maximum of 90% of earned XP. Under the old system, the minimum was about 9% 
    of earned XP, and the effective maximum was somewhere near 44% of earned XP.<br>
    Patron-to-grandpatron pass-up will have a minimum of 0% of XP passed-up by 
    the patron’s vassal, and a maximum of 10% of passed-up XP. Under the old 
    system, the minimum was about 30% and the maximum was about 94%.<br>
    You will see that while the pass-up for grandpatrons and higher will be 
    greatly decreased, the maximum pass-up for direct vassal-to-patron pass-up 
    will be increased. This reinforces the basic patron-vassal relationship 
    while reducing the amount of experience that is generated further up the 
    chain.<br>
    <br>
    Let’s look at the example we had before, characters A through J, all 
    optimized for maximum pass-up. If character A earns 1 million XP, character 
    B will receive 900,000 XP. This is much higher than before! But character C 
    will only receive 90,000, and character D will only receive 9,000. 
    Characters H, I, and J will receive practically nothing. The new system will 
    create 1 million XP over ten levels of pass-up, unlike the existing system 
    which creates over 3 million.<br>
    <br>
    The old system had only slightly diminishing returns as the chain increased. 
    The new system will have drastically diminishing returns beyond the 
    immediate patron of the character earning the XP.<br>
    <br>
    Some of you will also want to know: Will we be removing previously gained 
    allegiance experience from existing characters? However, that is not an 
    option for us. The exact total amount of allegiance experience that a 
    character has received over their lifetime is not recorded by the system.<br>
    <br>
    </font><b><font size="3">What Do These Changes Mean?<br>
    </font><font size="2"><br>
    Direct Effects</font></b></span><ul>
      <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">Patrons of active characters will 
      see much more pass-up from these characters.</font></span></li>
      <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">Patrons or monarchs with inactive 
      vassals, but active grand-vassals, will see much less pass-up from these 
      characters. Characters that are in XP chains will see the XP that they 
      receive from these chains decrease.</font></span></li>
      <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">Due to the changes in Leadership 
      and Loyalty, the numerical value of these skills will decrease. However 
      the new skill curves will take this into account. A patron who has put XP 
      into Leadership may have a lower value in the skill than before, but they 
      will be receiving as much or more XP from their direct vassals as before 
      because of the changes to the system.</font></span></li>
      </ul>
    <p><span class="Title2"><font size="2"><b>Additional Expected Effects</b></font></span><ul>
        <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">Those players who are most 
        concerned with optimizing their XP over time will probably try to 
        recruit 12 active vassals of the highest possible level. This will 
        create a great benefit for the patron character, with less benefit for 
        the patron’s patron and no experience benefit for the vassals. The chain 
        system, which benefited all members above the lowest vassal in the 
        chain, will become much less valuable.</font></span></li>
        <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">Monarchs of “traditional” 
        allegiances, particularly those in old allegiances in which their direct 
        vassals are no longer active, may see their received pass-up greatly 
        decrease. If they are concerned with pass-up XP, they may seek to 
        reorganize their monarchies. </font></span></li>
        <li><span class="Title2"><font size="2">It will become easier to 
        “power-level” a secondary character by swearing your primary character 
        to him or her. However, it will be much harder to power-level three or 
        more characters with one primary character.</font></span></li>
        </ul>
    <p><b><span class="Title2"><font size="3">Additional Improvements</font></span></b><p>
        <span class="Title2"><font size="2"><b>Visible Player Information<br>
        </b><br>
        On one hand, you will no longer be able to view the Loyalty and 
        Leadership skills of a player by ID’ing him or her. On the other hand, 
        you will be able to see when the character was created, and in 
        particular whether the character was created before or after the new 
        allegiance XP system was implemented.<br>
        <br>
        The first change should foster more social interaction when seeking new 
        vassals. No longer can you ID every player you see and immediately try 
        to recruit the one with the highest Loyalty! <br>
        <br>
        We are implementing the second change because we understand than many 
        players are very competitive and enjoy comparing their accomplishments 
        against those of their peers. To this end, players will want to know if 
        a character was leveled to 126 in the “old days” when chain XP was 
        effective, or under the “new system”.<br>
        <br>
        While we’d really love to be able to show you exactly how much 
        allegiance XP a character has received, we unfortunately can’t do that. 
        We felt that this was the next best thing. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Monarchy Improvements<br>
        </b><br>
        We understand that many monarchs may see this as a “nerf”. Pass-up XP 
        was one of the tangible benefits of running an allegiance, along with 
        the ability to purchase a mansion and other smaller benefits.<br>
        <br>
        We have plans to add a number of benefits to monarchs and monarchies in 
        the future. In the short term, you should be seeing limited allegiance 
        chat in the January event, as we stated in the Letter to the Players. We 
        also would like to implement a number of organizational tools for 
        monarchs, including the ability to permanently restrict a character or 
        an account from swearing into an allegiance. <br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="3"><b>Summary<br>
        </b></font><font size="2"><br>
        The changes described in this article will enter the game in the 
        February event. These changes will reshape many allegiances along new 
        lines, with stronger direct patron-vassal bonds. Those players who want 
        to benefit most from allegiance pass-up will put XP into their 
        Leadership and Loyalty skills, and the benefit they see will be 
        commensurate with the experience they invest.<br>
        <br>
        In the end, we believe that these changes will greatly benefit Asheron’s 
        Call. As I wrote at the beginning, we plan on sticking around for a 
        long, long time to come. We do expect to see a lot of heated feedback on 
        these changes, both from those who feel that we should not do this, and 
        those who feel we are not doing enough. During this time, we will do our 
        best to answer your questions about this new system.<br>
        <br>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=162">Turbine AC Site</a></span></font></small><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">After our article on
    <a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=157">Allegiance 
    Experience changes</a>, we received an enormous amount of feedback, which we 
    expected. In this article, we’d like to answer some of the most common 
    questions and complaints about the new system.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you haven’t read the first article yet, 
    please read it before you read this one – otherwise most of this won’t make 
    much sense.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Date of Birth</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The players who complained about how we 
    presented the reasoning for the Date of Birth feature are right: The message 
    was phrased badly and we should have realized it would be insulting to some 
    players. We certainly didn't mean to imply that players who used XP chains 
    in the past were cheaters; with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, however, it 
    is pretty obvious how that phrasing can be taken. In truth, we have been 
    planning the DoB feature for a long time; this seemed like a propitious 
    moment to implement it, since we had time on the schedule and it seemed to 
    be important to the XP Chain issue, too. It looked like killing two birds 
    with one stone to us. We should have been more sensitive in how we presented 
    it, especially considering the polarizing nature of the issue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, to all of you: We apologize. We had no 
    intention of insulting or offending you, and we apologize for our choice of 
    wording in the article.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To be very clear: Those who may have 
    optimized allegiance pass-up through chains in the past are neither cheaters 
    nor exploiters. The system was what it was, and we bear no ill will towards 
    those who found ways to best advance their characters with it. We don't feel 
    that leaving the system in the game is in the best interests of the future 
    of AC, but our wish to change the system in no way reflects any feelings 
    towards those who used it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Specifically regarding the date-of-birth 
    visibility, we have been listening to your feedback. Taking that into 
    account, we will be making the following changes:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The display of your character's date of 
      birth will be on a toggleable option, defaulting to off. Your date of 
      birth will only be visible to other players if you choose to turn the 
      option on. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Because of this added functionality, we 
      won't be able to introduce this feature in February as we had originally 
      planned. Instead, an optional date of birth display (plus optional 
      displays of other interesting character data, such as your age, chess 
      rank, number of deaths, and fishing skill) will be added in March.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This way those players who wish to display 
    this information have the option, and those players who do not wish to are 
    not forced to.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again, we apologize for our choice of words 
    and any misunderstanding that this has caused.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Powerleveling Characters</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of players came to us with concerns 
    that, under the new system with optimized pass-up, it would be considerably
    <i>easier</i> to quickly get a character to high levels.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are two responses to this concern. The 
    first is that yes, it will be easier to get one character to high levels. 
    However rapidly advancing dozens if not hundreds of characters 
    simultaneously will be much more difficult. The old system created huge 
    amounts of XP for almost all participants – under the new system, only 
    direct patrons receive the largest benefit. We are not specifically trying 
    to remove the ability to powerlevel characters through the allegiance 
    system, but we are removing a system that provided, in our opinion, too much 
    free experience to almost all participants.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second thing to keep in mind is that 
    achieving optimum pass-up is not trivial. To reach the maximum direct 
    pass-up of 90% of earned XP, the following must all be true:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The vassal has capped his or her Loyalty.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The patron has capped his or her 
      Leadership. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The time that this vassal has spent sworn 
      to the patron, both in terms of in-game time and real time, is at the 
      maximum. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The average of the times that all the 
      vassals of this patron have been sworn (again both in-game and real time) 
      are at the maximum. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The patron has at least four vassals.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Capped” means that the skill has been raised 
    to a point where no more experience can be spent on it. For Loyalty and 
    Leadership, that will be 208 if the skills are trained, 236 if the skills 
    are specialized.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Maximizing the time sworn modifiers will not 
    be easy either. The two factors are multiplied together to get the final 
    modifier. For example, if you have been sworn for half the time needed for 
    the maximum of the in-game modifier, but only a tenth of the time needed for 
    the real time modifier, you will only have 5% of the maximum time sworn 
    benefit.&nbsp; (50% * 10% = 5%)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This factor will cause a number of the 
    “rotating patron” schemes that we’ve seen described to be less effective 
    than their designers may have hoped. The real time sworn takes a very long 
    time to reach its maximum.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Trades Characters</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many players expressed concern that they 
    would no longer be able to use small three-character chains to level their 
    dedicated tradeskill characters. In the past, I could swear my main 
    character to one of your characters, and then you could swear your character 
    to my trades character. Because of the way the system worked, we could 
    easily ensure that almost all the experience that I passed up to you was 
    also passed up to my trades character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the one hand, this is no longer the case. 
    The experience passed up to my trades character from my main will be 
    considerably diminished. However, if your character is at all active, the 
    experience passed up to my trades character from you will be considerably <i>
    increased</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, keep in mind that there are 
    already a few quests for trades characters, and that many trophy items exist 
    that can be turned into a collector in exchange for experience. (The casinos 
    are an excellent place to find these trophies.) And we are always looking 
    for new ways that trades characters can gain experience.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="3">Time Sworn for Existing Allegiance Ties</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In our original article, we wrote:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Existing patron-vassal relationships 
      will start with the same bonus that they are currently receiving. For 
      example, if you have been sworn to your patron for enough time to receive 
      50% of the maximum benefit, you will still receive 50% of the maximum 
      benefit when the new system is implemented.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is not entirely accurate. After the 
    original article went out, we discovered that the system we had planned to 
    use could not be implemented because of how the information needed is 
    currently stored. Instead, you will receive the same bonus from your <i>
    in-game</i> time sworn. When you log in after the February event goes live, 
    your in-game time will be adjusted to ensure that you receive the same bonus 
    from it that you did before the event. There is one exception – your in-game 
    time sworn can never be greater than the total age of the character.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, let’s say that my character has 
    been in-game for 1 full day, and has been sworn to the same patron for all 
    but 1 hour of that. Currently the time sworn is 23 hours. When I log in 
    after the February event, the game will multiply those 23 hours by a factor 
    to get the new time sworn bonus. However, because my character has only been 
    around for 1 in-game day, the time sworn is capped at 1 day. When I log in, 
    I’ll be getting a smaller bonus from in-game time sworn than I did before 
    the event. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This may affect a small number of characters, 
    but it was necessary to prevent strange situations caused by characters 
    having an in-game time sworn that was longer than their total in-game time. 
    You’ll see why this is necessary in the next paragraph.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Real time sworn will also be calculated upon 
    first login after the February event. Because the real time date that you 
    swore to your patron was never stored in a form we can use, we have to 
    either start everyone from 0 real time sworn, or make a guess. So after the 
    game recalculates your in-game time sworn, it will compare that time to the 
    total amount of time you have spent online since character creation. That 
    ratio will be applied to the total amount of real time since character 
    creation to get a rough approximation of the amount of real time that the 
    character has been sworn.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, for example, let’s say that after the 
    in-game time calculation, it sets my in-game time sworn to two weeks, and my 
    total in-game time is a month. My in-game time sworn is half of my total 
    in-game time, so my real time sworn is set to half of the total real time 
    since the character was created. If my character were created a year ago, my 
    real time sworn would be set to 6 months.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You may have picked up on the “upon first 
    login” part of this. Unfortunately, we don’t have the information we need to 
    make the adjustments until you log in. What does this mean for abandoned or 
    inactive characters? Until these characters enter the game, their in-game 
    time sworn is not adjusted and their real time sworn is left at 0.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One thing to keep in mind – this does mean 
    that the pass-through from these characters will be drastically reduced. 
    However, <i>all</i> pass-through has been drastically reduced. If you were 
    relying on the XP passed up from grand-vassals through an inactive 
    character, you’ll find that this XP will be greatly reduced whether or not 
    this character ever logs in again.</font></p>

    Jan 14 18:00:01 2004<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Replex&gt; ****The time is now 9:00 PM EST, the developers chat will begin 
    shortly****<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Tonight's chat is mainly on the subscripton price increase, the 
    new servers and the allegiance pass-up changes. You all have a TON of great 
    questions and we'll try to get to as many as we can. We have most of the AC1 
    Live Team here tonight, as you can see and we thank them all for coming! 
    With that said... onto the first question.<br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Some players feel that the increase in the fee is also because of 
    the development costs of an expansion. Can you shed any light on what the 
    graphics upgrades included in the expansion will consist of? <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; Bear in mind that the following could 
    change later on, as we continue our R&amp;D on this one:<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; The current plan we’re investigating is to basically quadruple 
    the size of the textures and make some changes to the engine to make that 
    possible. That will allow Scenario and other artists to do some really 
    interesting things. You’ve seen what Scenario can do already with a 4 year 
    old engine; imagine what he could do if he had twice depth with which to 
    work. It will also allow people with older machines and video cards to still 
    access the gam<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; After that, we have a decision to make: Do we replace the 
    thousands of textures in the game, or create new lands using new, enhanced 
    textures? Each has advantages, but that’s where we’re at. We’ll be coming to 
    the players later on and asking for opinions, when we have a better idea of 
    just what we can do and still get the expansion out before the heat death of 
    the universe.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Why, yes, I DO type that fast. Why do you ask?<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; :D<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Done.<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Vn_lubomirii AKA Death Cometh of Darktide asks: Is the new server 
    going to provide something the others do not? The other servers are not that 
    overloaded with people on login from the &quot;glory&quot; days. What is the reason 
    FOR the new server now? <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; In the main, the new server is planned so 
    that people who want to start over without competing with XP chains, have a 
    place to do just that. It is a thorny issue, with players on both sides of 
    the debate, so it made sense with something this important to provide a 
    choice. <br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Another reason is to show our commitment to the game, that we 
    aren’t about sucking the life out of it and then burying the corpse. 
    Frankly, we think the glory days of the game are ahead, not in the past, and 
    that means investing in growth. I know that reads as corny and just so much 
    marketing fluff, but live and work every day with that thought in mind.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; We can’t do everything at once, of course, but we have to start 
    somewhere. This seemed like a good starting point.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; done</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; What are the player conflict settings of the new server (i.e., 
    will it be a regular world, PK, or PKL only?) <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; It will be a regular world.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; done<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Zedon AKA Red Huntress of Frostfell asks: Will there be more 
    resources in place with the coming of the new server to enforce the CoC?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; One of the things we are determined to do 
    is raise the bar on customer service and that includes CoC enforcement. That 
    is NOT a knock on Microsoft or the way they do things now, by the way. <br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; But if we’re going to bring the game home, why would we settle 
    for the current standard? If we’re not going to at least try to raise the 
    bar, what’s the point?<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; So you can expect more CoC enforcement. I caution that it won’t 
    all begin overnight or all at the same time; we still have a whole customer 
    service infrastructure to get in place and that is going to take some time.
    <br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; How successful we are in that enforcement… well, each of you will 
    have to determine that for yourselves.<br>

    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Ufhamlet AKA Montezuma's Revenge of Harvestgain asks: Can we 
    anticipate new ways to level non-combat viable characters (trade-skill and 
    tinker mules, particularly?) <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; I'll let srand and the team answer that 
    one.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;srand&gt; There are already several ways to level non-combat characters in the 
    game. These include trophies that give XP and some crafter-oriented quests, 
    for example. In addition, the changes to the allegiance XP system will 
    actually provide a boost for targeted leveling of characters, including 
    non-combat tradeskill characters.<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; And, no doubt, we'll be expanding on the non-combat choices in AC in 
    the future. <br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Done.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04In case you're wondering folks, we're kicking people with 
    offensive names<br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Or those that harass devs via PMs :)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;Dev_Nexx&gt; Thanks para, whew</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; &lt;Black-Metal&gt;: Question: Please explain the increased costs or at 
    least touch base on what they are.<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04DO NOT USE YOUR NICK LIKE THAT<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04 &lt;Black-Metal&gt;: Question: Please explain the increased costs or 
    at least touch base on what they are. <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; Can you elaborate? If you're wasking what 
    the increase is for, we covered that in the message Monday.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; The costs in general have gone up across the board...<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; I believe that's what was being asked, thanks. :)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; good hardware, software licenses, salaries 
    and wages, benefits... about the only cost that has really come down in the 
    last 4 years...<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; is bandwidth, and that still isn't cheap.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Also, if we're to expand the customer service and raise the bar, 
    then we need more people, and that is the most expensive part overall, in 
    the long run...<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; then, we are going to basically double the size of the dev team 
    to build the expansion pack.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; So, that is the general answer. Did I give you the info you were 
    lokking for?done.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; (We also know that the IGN client is hard to read. There's 
    unfortunately nothing we can do about that. However, there WILL be a log 
    posted after the chat. We apologize for the inconvience.)<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04 Please do NOT PM us or Devs with questions!<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04&lt;B_W&gt; With the new server and price change, will we have a 
    chance to see more admins ingame? the ucm policy has been very very slow 
    lately, thanks to all the plugin alerts. Is there any plan to fix that?<br>
    &lt;Pyro-Elf&gt; Feel free to PM me, I'll only laugh then go back to reading 
    this...<br>
    &lt;Kardon_Seph&gt; Anything that breaks the VN board CoC or any inappropriate 
    names are being served with bans.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; Yep, we'll see more admins and more hours 
    in general being put to CoC enforcement. It is a high priorty for us.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Bear in mid, however, that we can't hit everythng all at once.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; We're still outtting the organization together, :D<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; done.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Replex&gt; &lt;|WarCry|&gt; Question: With the Fee increase will we see more DEV 
    interaction, and Live Events take Place?<br>
    &lt;Replex&gt; &lt;|WarCry|&gt; Question: With the Fee increase will we see more DEV 
    interaction, and Live Events take Place?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; Sorry, got distracted there. :&gt; We're always 
    striving to keep a goodly ampunt if interaction between the devs and the 
    players.<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; And we know how much you guys like live events.<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Mayseth&gt; Buncha idiots so far eh?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; We'd like to concentrate more resources on 
    these in the future, although, as Jessica said, bear in mind that we can't 
    do everything at once.<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Done.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; OK, let's get something straight....<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; We don't hate DT. Heck, half of us play our mains on DT...<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; But as I said before: We can't do everything at once.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; The best choice for the new server world was a regualr world.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; when the time is right and the usage warrants it, we'll cnsider a 
    secind PK world.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; Again, just give us some time.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; done</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; I'm going to jump in here real quick ...<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; One thing I've seen a number of people ask about is a special rules 
    server. Maybe one with no XP passup at all, or with a level cap of 50, or 
    perma-PKL, or even just one that gets wiped every three months.<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Right now, we're just opening the one new server, and it'll be our 
    first one in wuite a while, so we wanted to keep things simple. But in the 
    future, as we have a chance to open more servers, we definitely would like 
    to open some with special rules.<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04Ignore that<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04Something has gone wrong with the IRC. Please don't all change 
    back your names at once<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; Of course, before we'd open a server with 
    special rules, we'd open a new PK server. <br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Done.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Yrsa&gt; Thank you.<br>
    &lt;PrismaticShimmer&gt; oop<br>
    &lt;Replex&gt; We are sorry for the delay. The dev chat will continue as normal 
    within minutes. Thank you.<br>
    &lt;Yrsa&gt; While we wait, how about an impomptu question: Is there a name for 
    the new server and do you have a date for opening?<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; &lt;@Pyro-Elf&gt; With the fixing of the experience chain, will we be 
    able to swear to lower levels (IE: 126s to 100s)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; On the name and date for launch of the new 
    world....<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; we haven't decided on a name yet. <br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; And we don;t know exactly when the new world will launch, but 
    we're ordring the server racks as we speak...<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; so, Speing, lord willin' and the creek don't rise.<br>
    &lt;JessicaM&gt; done</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; Well, I can take the other one. :&gt; We're not 
    considering changing the level restrictions on swearing allegiance at this 
    time. <br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Done.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; &lt;Xada&gt; What possible negative impacts of the XP changes were/are 
    being considered by Turbine, and is there concern for the future of the 
    game?<br>
    &lt;Serge-chan&gt; I have a better idea, May.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;Ibn&gt; I can grab this one<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; We discussed these XP changes internally quite a bit, and considered 
    many of the impacts<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; For example<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; In the article that was posted, we noted that monarchs of allegiances 
    may see their passup XP decrease<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; In addition, those allegiance that place a heavy concern on passup may 
    seek to reorganize, which could be challenging<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; We've run the math on a number of different scenarios to try and find 
    how some may try to exploit this system<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; So, yes, we have considered many possible negative impacts<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; However the positives greatly outweight the possible negatives<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; Regarding the future -- the future of this game is always one of our 
    main concerns. We want this game to stick around for a long, LONG time. 8)<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; It's starting to get late, so we'll only be able to do another two 
    questions.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; &lt;Bink&gt; Question XP Chain : With the changing of how xp is made, 
    guilds will deviate from the typical linear patern to a more mushroom like 
    pattern, exluding many people from the bonus of having a rank chain at the 
    bottom, will this be addressed in anyway?<br>
    &lt;Kaltemar&gt; 04If you didn't notice: &lt;Bink&gt; Question XP Chain : With the 
    changing of how xp is made, guilds will deviate from the typical linear 
    patern to a more mushroom like pattern, exluding many people from the bonus 
    of having a rank chain at the bottom, will this be addressed in anyway?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;Ibn&gt; Got it... typing... 8)<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; If a guild wants to reform to maximize XP passup, at the expense of 
    rank, that would be their choice. <br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; There is probably a middle way...<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; It should be possible for allegiances to maintain their rank concerns 
    -- such as for a mansion -- while still having passup XP<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; Although the passup may not be 100% optimized<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; done<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; sorry, one more thing<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; Please keep in mind that patrons with active vassals will likely see 
    MORE passup XP than before<br>
    </font><br>
    -Serge-chan:#asheron- We are tired of the stupid nicknames. Failure to use a 
    decent nickname will be punished by a swift and permanent server ban. 
    Consider this your one and only warning.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;Ibn&gt; So some players may not want to reorganize<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; There are many choices available. 8)<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; ok, now actually done<br>
    &lt;Ibn&gt; OK, time for the last question...<br>
    </font><br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Okay, and for the last question... What additional enhancements 
    are you planning for Monarchs and Monarchy management?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; Oooh, I can answer this!<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Well, I can tell you some of the more likely stuff we've talked 
    about, anyway. I don't think I can tell you everything we've thrown about. 
    :&gt;<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Anyway, one of the first things we want to get operational is the 
    notion of a 'banned' list for the allegiance. In other words, the monarch or 
    officers could specify characters or accounts that they don't want to be 
    able to swear in, no matter what. <br>
    &lt;srand&gt; This should help a bit with managing the allegiance. In addition to 
    that, we'd like to expand on the idea of 'speaker' and make real officers 
    for the allegiance -- so the monarch can appoint people to help them with a 
    variety of different tasks.<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Another task we'd like to get done soon is more control over 
    allegiance chat. We're introducing a basic chat, but there's a good many 
    refinements that we'd like to add, especially in terms of the monarch &amp; 
    officer's control over the chat environment.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Southern&gt; @81.48.73.36<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;srand&gt; We've even done some preliminary work towards 
    allowing players to name their allegiances, although that feature is still 
    quite a ways off if we can get it working. And we've discussed some cool 
    ideas with heraldry -- but we have no specific plans for that yet, we're 
    still just batting around ideas. Okay, they are telling me I'm babbling now. 
    *grin*<br>
    &lt;srand&gt; Done.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;JessicaM&gt; OK, folks. That does it for tonight. Thanks 
    for sticking through the split.</font><br>
    <br>
    &lt;Paraduck&gt; Okay, thanks for coming out to answer the questions! I'm really 
    sorry about the net split, the text, and other problems that occured 
    tonight. There will be a log posted shortly.<br>
