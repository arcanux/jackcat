    <font face="Arial" size="2">On a bluff overlooking Khayyaban, Jenavere and 
    Hendac stood with the old woman, silhouetted by the setting sun, which had 
    been dwindling over the last three months and now glowed a feeble red. 
    Sulfur-tinted clouds had been racing across the land all day. A storm was 
    brewing. Soon, the looming dark of the Demon would be seen on the northern 
    horizon. It appeared more frequently of late -- little wonder the three 
    Master Smiths had hastened to finish the design of their new gemstone armor.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The moons 
    hung low in the east -- swollen, filling more of the sky every day. Some 
    whispered they were falling. Hendac had called it a Hunter's Moon, and Jena 
    had shivered. She held a sputtering torch close to the ground. Just beyond 
    them in a large circle, the sand had changed to a fine, ash-gray powder. 
    “What do you think, Mistress Najmima?” she said. “Is it like the others?”
    </font></span></p>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The old 
    archmage walked to the center of the ash. She stretched out her palms, 
    closed her eyes, and flinched as if struck. “Pain, child,” Najmima 
    whispered. “A voice beneath here screams in agony. No . . . many voices, 
    shrieking as one. Voices twisted together by black arts. Life rent and 
    reformed to serve another's needs. It . . . they . . . have slept for ages, 
    but are now bidden to wake and serve again. The magic coursing through the 
    land . . . It twists around a black void. There is . . . a parasite beneath 
    us.” Jena and Hendac exchanged a knowing look. </font></span></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial"><i>For months, floating Crystals and Shadow creatures have
    held stations in the wilderness, arranged like pieces in a game. Now they have mobilized.
    Rumored to have emerged from the earth, strange, twisted citadels hover over the land near
    several towns, and a vast, bat-winged figure is now regularly seen flickering like dark
    lightning amid the storm clouds. Have Dereth's heroes forced the leaders of the Shadows
    into some sort of desperate stand, or are these merely the opening moves in some larger
    and darker conflict?</i> </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Continuing our commitment to bring you a major new chapter in
    Dereth's saga every month, we introduce the March event! A relative calm prevails despite
    the ghastly floating citadels and other omens. Dereth's heroes have managed to extend the
    reach of civilization, so builders have constructed festival grounds in outlying areas and
    even a magnificent wedding hall to host the mass ceremonies traditional in the spring.
    Master Smiths tinkering with crystal fragments and shadow gems have managed to incorporate
    them into superior suits of armor. Perhaps most significantly, the Asheron's Call
    developers have embarked on a project to refine the graphics engine, introducing colored
    lighting effects and amazing new Drudges and Golems. The world of Asheron's Call will come
    into even sharper focus over the coming months. Thanks for joining us in the adventure! </font></small>

    2000</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are all the tiny little details of the 
    game update that was made on March 7, 2000. This list is culled from 
    &quot;check-in&quot; notes submitted by the game developers themselves. Things of 
    greatest note are listed first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We won't reveal many changes concerning the 
    new story developments, as these hold opportunities for players to drive the 
    saga forward, and we don't want to take away the fun of discovery. As usual, 
    the Town Criers, Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the 
    trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and 
    abilities of items are not always detailed here. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Detailed Notes for builds 2290-2296: </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Colored lighting! Many lights, including 
      the sun and moon, will now cast colored light in both hardware and 
      software modes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All-new Drudge models. Beautiful! </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All-new Golem models. Gorgeous! Kill a 
      golem today! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wedding Hall added, plus fun wedding 
      favors. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Festival Grounds have been added near the 
      Festival Stones named Wintersebb (near Qalaba'r), Leafcull (near Yanshi), 
      and Leafdawning (near Rithwic). These are great places to hold contests of 
      skill, since they have dummy targets of various difficulty -- the 
      Leafdawning one also has a racetrack!. Scribes sell directions to all 
      Festival Stones. Whack an oaken Drudge today! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hand-to-hand combat is easier versus 
      moving targets. You will “stick” to your target more. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Weapons that use the dagger skill have 
      never used coordination to determine their &quot;damage modifier&quot;; they used 
      strength. They now use coordination, like they're supposed to according to 
      the documentation. The higher your coordination, the more damage you will 
      do. This was done by popular demand and hopefully will please more 
      dagger-users than it will annoy. Since dagger-users have always needed 
      coordination and not strength to improve their dagger skill, this change 
      should help them focus their attribute-building. This affects the 
      following classes of weapons: dagger, jambiya, khanjar, and knife. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mages got proficiency-point gains for 
      casting a spell on a creature, whether or not it resisted! This was broken 
      compared to the way PP works for all other skills. Now, you don't gain PP 
      by casting a spell unless the spell is NOT resisted by the target. This 
      was a great way to gain PP, but it was unfair and broken, and it now is 
      fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer equip bows with crossbow 
      bolts and crossbows with arrows. There was a clever loophole making this 
      possible. It was never intended to be this way. Fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed bug where you couldn't strafe while 
      walking or running in Thrown Combat mode. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Now if you cannot put a new craft object 
      into your inventory (due to its being full or your being too encumbered), 
      then you will get an error message and not complete the act. (You actually 
      get a success then an error message; we will fix that later.) Still, it's 
      a bad idea to have your main inventory be full, or to be at maximum 
      encumbrance. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When shopping with maxed-out encumbrance, 
      you'll find transactions are a bit easier. Still not a good idea, though.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Artifex Vault has a fix to a locked door 
      that was confounding. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lure Blade 1 updated. Was using wrong 
      component. Lure Blade and Turn Blade spells had problems since they both 
      shared the same formula. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When appraising lockable items, if you 
      have the lockpick skill, they now display their lockpick difficulty 
      appropriately. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">True Value can now be cast on orbs, wands, 
      and scrolls. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi Noble and Queen can fit through 
      smaller spaces . . . beware. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wells and Fountains in towns should be 
      usable by players to get water. The solution here is pretty cool. Flasks 
      can be used from a player's inventory on a well to get water! Shopkeepers 
      sell flasks. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">No matter what your Alchemy skill, as long 
      as it is trained, you will use the Smelting Pot successfully. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spell icons for Blade Bane/Lure, Bludgeon 
      Bane/Lure, Acid Bane/Lure, Frost Bane/Lure, and Fire Bane/Lure updated 
      with proper colors. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Life magic spells no longer work against 
      characters in the purple-bubble stage before they materialize from a 
      teleport. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A clever exploit made it possible to hold 
      a chest open and leave the area. Not anymore. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You get a confirmation dialog when using 
      uncharged mana stones on items that would be destroyed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Errant &quot;Tool was destroyed&quot; messages 
      fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New creature emotes allow more flexible 
      creative effects. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New technology introduced that sets the 
      stage for more complex questing. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now use extended/accented 
      characters in chat. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The dart (or whatever) throwing animations 
      pushed a character back each throw -- back, back, back . . . Fixed. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lugian Boulder launch needed a sound. Well 
      I did better. I provided a sound for the Lugian boulder launch AND 
      collision. And the landing now sounds NICE and LOUD!!! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Texture memory warning should only appear 
      once after startup and after settings are changed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Various infusions and oils now look like 
      they should, with colored bottles as they appear on the ground matching 
      the icons in inventory. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Female chest used to sink when putting on 
      certain armors, allowing her head to float above her body slightly. No 
      more. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Scrolled examine panel will now stay at 
      the scroll point when its data is refreshed. Makes it easier to examine 
      something when its mana is dropping. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">After you inscribe an item, shortcut keys 
      1-9 could stop working. Fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Golem stomp attacks no longer sound like 
      sword-swishes, instead they sound like large stomps! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Projectile spells were colliding with

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Greetings! I'm Scott Herrington, the Turbine 
    Producer for AC and filling in for Chris Foster this month. Much like when 
    Regis filled in for Letterman, you can expect the same format, but far less 
    comedy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We've been basking in some of your praise 
    from the last event, talking about the new boost to the graphics engine, the 
    purpose of the huge spires, and the revised golems and drudges. My hat's off 
    to the art department and our programmers for getting that stuff in, as I 
    think you'll agree that it looks fantastic. Dave, Jesse, and L'Etoile have 
    been working overtime to keep the grand story of AC moving forward, and 
    Eri's been trying to stay ahead of the crushing wave of content plans, 
    features, and bug fixes that she's got to contend with every month. They're 
    all doing a great job, and you won't believe what's coming up in the next 
    few months. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the chat, I know that you're all 
    wondering about the &quot;stickiness&quot; issue. After the first few days, there was 
    the knee-jerk reaction to the first wave of criticism: “Pull it out” Then, 
    we started hearing a number of players say they liked the patch, and we 
    thought: “Maybe we should just let it be . . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, we're not going to do either of those 
    things. We just made some minor changes to the system, and introduced those 
    on Thursday. We're confident that the change is beneficial for you. Does 
    that mean we'll only make the one change and then quit? No. As long as a 
    system seems out of whack, we'll fix it. There may be some further changes 
    in future updates to close the gap between our intention and the 
    implementation. I hope you'll stick around to see. (Sorry for the bad pun)
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, what else? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here's some other stuff that I've wanted to 
    talk about: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Don't give out your ZoneID and password to 
      another player. Sounds like common sense, but it happens more often than 
      you'd think and is the most common way people have their accounts 
      “hacked.” Also beware of several shady programs out there that look 
      innocent but are really designed to take control of your computer 
      remotely, and can be used to hijack your character. Use your common 
      Internet sense -- it's a mean world out there! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Use the Sentinels, Advocates, and Online 
      Team for help if you think that something &quot;fishy&quot; is going on in the game 
      world. They're there to help (by the way, no member of the Online Team 
      should ever ask you for your password). </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And yes, Chris “Slapp” Foster or another AC 
    designer will be writing this article from here on out once they see how 
    badly I've done this month's column.</font></p>

    Welcome to the Asheron's Call Developer's Chat. We will begin at 5 pm 
    Pacific. Current Time: 3:45 pm Pacific. The AC Developer's Chat will begin 
    in about 5 minutes Dave@turbine&gt; Hi all amr@Turbine&gt; greetings and 
    salutations! Thank You for coming to our monthly AC Developer Chat. A few 
    ground rules before we begin. We ask that you have your questions pre-typed 
    in notepad and ready to copy and paste when your turn is up. This will help 
    get through the most people possible. We also ask that you only ask one 
    question. The developers will only answer the first question that you ask. 
    This too is so we can allow the greatest number of people a chance to ask 
    questions. With that said, I would like to turn the floor over to Scott 
    Herrington, Producer of Asheron's Call. <br>

    the different departments at Turbine (programming, art, community, 
    production, and design) so hopefully, we should be able to answer your

    cfoster@Turbine&gt; We're working hard to balance content across ALL levels of 
    players, from hardcore L33t players, to the more casual folks. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Many of our quests have been aimed at higher levels, but 
    we're now looking for ways to produce adventuring opportunities for players

    If not, why not? <br>

    GreenNun&gt; yay house shoku! </b><br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Actually, the spawns in the dires are random... <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; it got fixed from the bugged spawns a bit ago <br>

    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Hi Leviathen1. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Leviathen1&gt; hi :) it's kind of a long question :) *hopes he isnt

    </b><br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; oooooo <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; *readies fostering ray* <br>
    <br>
    <b>Leviathen1&gt; page 52 of the manual states &quot;swords are, according to many 
    fighters, the finest of all weapons. They are quicker and ligher than axes, 
    do more damage than aggers, and can both slash and stab. They are more 
    difficult to learn than other weapons, <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; however, and are more likely to inflict minor grazes and nicks, 
    than say, a battle axe or morning star&quot; with that said sword is the most 
    expensive melee skill, the free dagger skill has the 8-9 ghertas dagger 
    which makes all melee weapons pale when compa <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; damage weapons and has a 50% rather than the 25% damage range of 
    swords, staff has the very nice damage range of the atlan staff, unarmed has 
    hamund's katar which has comperable stats to the best unarmed weapon and 
    usable <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; spells (even if they are only II's and III's as a level 37 
    blademaster i can use the magic if im buffed with creature VI's), bow users 
    have the railgun err 112% yumi+coord bonus+150%skill dial-a-crit bar. while 
    sword <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; users have the ungodly slow even after high level SK still 
    horrible damage spread overlord sword, and the midrange damage 
    YourNeverGonnaUseTheSpellsOnThisSwordTillYouCanGet 
    LootRightsOnANobleAndWontNeedItAnyMore soll. <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; so i guess my question is at what point does sword live up to 
    it's skill cost as very powerful after you struggle enough, since 260ish 
    sword skill doesnt seem to fall into that range of you worked your tail off 
    to get here now </b><br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Does this question come with footnotes? :) <br>
    <br>
    <b>Leviathen1&gt; enjoy it range yet and after item it's flat out the worst 
    weapon as far as damage goes, only getting worse and worse as it goes if it 
    *does* manage to hit since unlike unarmed (which still has a hard time 
    hitting) swords <br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; dont come almost standard with +'s to attack/meleeD. or if it is 
    doomed to be one of the worst melee skills will people who trained/spec'd be 
    getting back skill points <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; sorry it was so long :) </b><br>

    amr@Turbine&gt; 42 <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Yes. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; :) <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Oh... that's it? jeeez, I thought it was going to be a long 
    question <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Wait, I'm still waiting for my T1 to finish downloading 
    it... <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Well, the manual says that &quot;swords are, according to many 
    fighters, the finest of all weapons&quot;.... <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; it doesn't say they necessarily ARE the best weapons <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; The differences between a sword and another weapon <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; fluxuate with the quality of weapon, and the enchantements 
    put on it <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; (short answer -- between us we do not have the collective 
    brain cells to answer your complex question at this time.) <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; so, on a general note, the sword is stronger than a 
    dagger... <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; (Scott's tapdancing to the contrary... :) <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; but, like all rules in life, there are tons of exceptions to 
    the rule <br>
    <br>
    amr@Turbine&gt; in general axes do have a &quot;tighter&quot; damage variance than 
    swords, i believe <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; thanks for the support Chris... <br>

    such they're danged costly to implement. <br>

    cfoster@Turbine&gt; We'll see as we look to future events and updates. (done)

    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Hi geniusclown, what can we answer for you? <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Great name... <br>
    <br>
    Dave@turbine&gt; I agree <br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; hi Ceazar. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Ceazar_AC&gt; Hi :) <br>
    <br>
    Ceazar_AC&gt; The current magic D system is akin to sending a warrior naked 
    into an Olthoi cave. It's been five months since the game went retail, PvM 
    Magic D is still perceived as broken and you still send warriors naked into 
    magic battles. <br>
    <br>
    Ceazar_AC&gt; Since armor and shields have been ruled out as ways to reduce 
    damage from magic attacks when can we expect to see magic D reworked so that 
    it is actually a defense instead of just a place to throw away experience 
    points? <br>
    <br>
    Ceazar_AC&gt; Great game anyway :) (Done) </b><br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Ceazar, the problem has always been balancing PvM magic 
    defense without upsetting PvP balance. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; There are ways to do it, but it's a precarious balancing 
    act, and one we need enough time to do well. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Believe me, m-d is a top priority. (done) <br>
    <br>
    <b>Greesil&gt; Over the last two events it seems as if you have decided a good 
    way to have a quest is to let players search for many hours for pieces of a 
    prize. Will most future seasons likely include quests like this? <br>
    </b><br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hi Greesil. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Greesil&gt; um yay house shoku <br>
    </b><br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; A big challenge has been dealing with crowding and camping 
    of existing quests. We added one major new feature -- quest flags -- which 
    deals with people who REPEAT quests indefinitely, clogging them. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; However, &quot;distributed camping&quot; is a solution to a slightly 
    different problem: how quickly people funnel into a quest. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; (This is a long answer...) <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; rightfully so <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Relying on random tokens slows down the flow of people into 
    a quest -- which, while frustrating at times, improves the quality of the 
    quest for players who do get into it. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; The question is: now that we have quest flags -- which also 
    let us speed up respawns on quest-items, speeding travel through quests -- 
    do we still need distributed camping? <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; I'd like to think so, but we're gonna have to do some test 
    cases. Watch this space. (done) <br>

    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; The systems have so many variables, that there are plenty 
    of ways for players with those two identical stats to be different. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Different bows, for example. Or enchantments on bows and 
    arrows. Your speed/accuracy setting has a BIG effect. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; And randomness has a factor, with critical hits being a 
    major contributor. <br>

    ferryman_charon&gt; QUESTION : Are there any plans to modify the current system 
    regarding &quot;specialization&quot;, which currently, has &quot;only&quot; a 12 or so skill 
    point lead over trained skills. The argument(and quite valid) is that 12 
    point lead in spec'd skills, is nothing, compared <br>

    amr@Turbine&gt; *nod* <br>
    <br>
    amr@Turbine&gt; it's not just the 12 point lead, if i understand you right...
    <br>
    <br>
    amr@Turbine&gt; it's also that spec'd skills reduce the curve of the xp cost
    <br>
    <br>
    amr@Turbine&gt; there's a more dramatic effective at the very high skill levels

    <b>Micronic&gt; Thank you for a fun game. My question concerns unarmed combat 
    vs. other melee combat. Although the last build addressed non-unarmed 
    warrior, there still exists unresolved balance issues. Players and Monsters 
    who use unarmed are still out-performing <br>
    <br>
    Micronic&gt; Monsters and Players who use Weapons. I would like to see a 
    closure of Unarmed vs. Non-unarmed. If you think unarmed combat is in 
    balance, then please watch an unarmed warrior use Item magic and Platemail 
    Gauntlets or when an unarmed warrior <br>
    <br>
    Micronic&gt; uses any one of their seven damage type weapons. Also watch 
    monsters without weapons deal nearly twice the damage of the very same 
    monster wielding a weapon AND attacking much faster with unarmed. <br>
    <br>
    Micronic&gt; My question is this: When will the non-free, more expensive melee 
    skills be brought up beyond Unarmed? (Yes beyond, since this is a skill 
    based game in which 'costs' are reflected via skill expense, Unarmed = Zero 
    cost for Sho) <br>
    <br>
    Micronic&gt; Done :) </b><br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; I think I've read all of your question... :) <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Short answer: we've been concentrating on balance between 
    melee and other classes, and will be adjusting balance between melee classes 
    after that's locked down. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; If we do too many tweaks at once, it's hard to say what's 
    affecting what. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Oh, and make that &quot;melee skills&quot; instead of &quot;melee classes&quot;

    <b>sulama&gt; Hi there, I'm a level 35 support mage pretty much at the end of

    the xp to skill point curve works out that the difference LESSENS over time, 
    not increases (from 15 points t <br>

    don't get any xp or take it all, but if I stay out of a fellowship and just 
    (de)buff I'd make my next level sometime in 2001. <br>

    that there are some plans to make it easier to use (here comes the feature

    gabehall&gt; I.e. You select the spell in the spell panel, and your cast button

    <b>LBeefus&gt; In an earlier chat, it was suggested that Throwing Weapons are

    <br>
    LBeefus&gt; and can't be enchanted in volume with spells. It takes so many to 
    kill anything that its impossible to find and carry enough to make them

    <br>
    Hawkorius&gt; Would it be right or feasible to give creatures like Olithoi a 
    jumping ability so as to not leave them as &quot;sitting ducks&quot; in numerous 
    ocasions to ranged attack? For example, I have a 280 base jump, if I can 
    jump on that rock, a big incredibly strong bug <br>
    <br>
    Hawkorius&gt; could easily make the jump. Ideally they could climb of course, 
    but since that isn't currently in the game I understand the limitations 
    there. Just a few monster AI tweaks like that could greatly help the game.
    </b><br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; formulating an answer in the backgrounds now.... <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; The answer is... <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; ...there's no easy answer. Jumping isn't supported in 
    monster AI, as calculating the proper conditions is an &quot;interesting&quot; 
    challenge. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; We could hack it with making monsters &quot;blip&quot; up and down, 
    but frankly it would look like a mess, and might lead to other problems. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; We'll look into it, but adding AI-jumping is doubtful. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; (done) <br>

    amr@Turbine&gt; a bow modifier increases the damage of the arrow shot from it

    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Two things we wanna fix, and are working on. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; First: stickiness helps melee a lot, but it makes it far 
    too easy for slower players ('n monsters) to whack players who are faster 
    than them. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Second, the sliding does look pretty cheesy. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; The first one is more important for gameplay so it's 
    higher-priority. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Right now we're working on an update that'll make 
    stickiness fairer, and we'll probably do more in the next month. More 
    thoughts, Scott? <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; You will actually see some changes later this week that will 
    help you out. We're testing them right now. The sliding will probably be 
    addressed in the next main update. <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; The new changes are beneficial to you, not harmful. <br>

    Scotth@Turbine&gt; So, hopefully both the people who appreciate the stickiness, 
    and those who hate it will be satisfied with the changes we're making <br>

    more frequent smaller props. It seems 3 days of happy exploration every 2 
    weeks, versus 4 every month would make more people happier. <br>
    <br>
    Quixotic_COD&gt; Secondly... I want to know how many backpattings have happened 
    from the Mote/Vault patch. Everything about that patch completely rocked. 
    The Gemstone armor doesn't have the same feel, at least for me. *Shake fist*
    <br>
    <br>
    Quixotic_COD&gt; Lastly, I want you to know, I intend to visit the Plateau 
    Windmills regularly, just to see what else happens to that poor thing :) It 
    makes me smile to see a windmill suffer so. <br>
    <br>
    Quixotic_COD&gt; Oh..and that sticky melee stuff...... (I love it :P Take that 
    LLAMA!) </b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Quixotic_COD&gt; Moo! (over.) </b><br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; We <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; are on a monthly prop schedule. doing them more often than 
    that is ridiculously tough <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; between the design, implementation, and testing cycles we go 
    through (not including waking the server guys up in the mornings to prop 'em)
    <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; a month is about as fast as we can get stuff in there. <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Actually, there wasn't time for backpatting on the 
    mote/vault patch. we had to get going on the next update! <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Jason will probably do something unexpected with the 
    windmills in the future.. what, i have no idea. But, that's the way he 
    operates... <br>

    take-outs&quot; on AC....;) <br>
    <br>
    Lt_Stahler&gt; Difficult questions, will there be MORE of a &quot;story&quot; in the 
    game? Meaning that, can it be done that we, as player characters, would 
    ultimately have a &quot;clearly defined goal&quot; other than emulate the &quot;Village 
    People&quot; with the *YMCA* emote?.:) </b><br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Whoo! <br>
    <br>
    Lt_Stahler&gt; Example, quests like Hamud, Mt Lethe and Folthid's but would 
    span a broader area, tough puzzles AND define the Isparian's role in Dereth? 
    Given Dev time constraints of course.;) <br>
    <br>
    <b>Lt_Stahler&gt; It's all fine and dandy that we get to level 50+ but after 
    awhile, it's noticeable that MOST become like Mr Kurtz in &quot;Heart of 
    Darkness&quot; and find the &quot;hollowness&quot; of it all....;P <br>
    <br>
    Lt_Stahler&gt; If not in AC, has this been thought out for AC2?...also will 
    there be more info on Ispar?.;) <br>
    <br>
    Lt_Stahler&gt; done </b><br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Funny you should ask, Lieutenant. (Or is that &quot;Light?&quot;) <br>
    <br>
    foster@Turbine&gt; In AC, we're trying to define a new sort of &quot;social 
    storytelling&quot; for MMP games. There are some things in our bag of tricks that 
    we haven't used yet. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Specifically, we've invested in some technology that'll let 
    players make more of an impression in the greater story of Dereth, the 
    Empyreans, and so forth. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; It IS hard, given the constraints of our schedules, but 
    there are some ways that you will feel more integral to what's going on. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; (sorry I'm being vague, I just don't want to give away 
    future events.) <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; We aren't thinking of things as grandiose as elections, or 
    massive changes BETWEEN worlds as a result of players' actions on each 
    world. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; That would, as you point out, be a better fit for a future 
    game. The infrastructure for such systems are massive. <br>
    <br>
    cfoster@Turbine&gt; Still, I think you'll like the advances we'll be making in 
    the months ahead. (done) <br>

    <b>Qmann&gt; Hi, I have to say that I love the game (been there since Beta). 
    And now to the question: Will u be implementing some kind of offline 
    communication/messaging system, specially for Patron/Vassal communication? 
    It is very frustrating when I need to talk to.. <br>
    <br>
    Qmann&gt; my vassals and it takes me sometimes a week to get in touch with them 
    because of timing/scheduling conflict. So it would make the derethina life a 
    whole lot easier if I can type something like /message &quot;vassalname&quot;, blah 
    blah... <br>
    <br>
    Qmann&gt; and then when they log in they get a game message saying something 
    like &quot;you have 2 messages&quot;. I don't know about other fellow players, but i 
    have lost some vassals because of the timing conflict ( i couldn't talk to 
    them in almost 2 weeks :). Done! </b><br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Many allegiances have their own web sites, but we are 
    looking at different ways for allegiances to communicate in-game <br>

    any eta on when it will be implemented? BTW It affects me even when facing 
    dead on with a monster and casting. (I showed this to an advocate the day 
    after the update) {done} </b><br>

    <b>Qwertypie&gt; ok, couple of PvP issues, #1) i have 360 run on darktide, a 
    lvl 23 with 200 was able to chase me down and almost kill me, dont get me

    mages/archers, but this is excessive:) (more)... <br>
    <br>
    Qwertypie&gt; 2)Is there going to be anything done with the current 
    elemental/protection scheme of armors? basically a good 1/2 of all 
    armor(metal) is useless for pvp because of its non-resistant properties <br>

    to the long time it takes to contact all vassals(can we PLEASE have 
    allegiance wide chat?) <br>

    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Can we pick which one question we answer? <br>

    allegiances. (done) <br>

    <b>Turboi85&gt; Hi! My question(s) gets asked every chat, but here goes it 
    anyway! Is private housing being developed now? If so, can I get an ETA? 
    Sorry for the two questions but I've been dreaming of housing since the 
    beginning of beta 2(drool) <br>
    <br>
    Turboi85&gt; My suggestion for it was housing not being actual building on the 
    landscape, but portals, so the house would be more like the meeting halls, 
    with a little foyer exactly like the meeting halls, except the doors that 
    lead to the rest of it are locked. <br>
    <br>
    Turboi85&gt; done <br>
    </b><br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; Ok.... <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; At the moment, we don't have any development resources 
    working on getting you housing. that doesn't mean that we won't, but we need 
    to iron out the normal event cycles... <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; and then we'll address the big problem that housing would 
    cause. <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; It really effects a bunch of systems that you wouldn't think 
    it would. <br>

    Scotth@Turbine&gt; check out l'etoile's old .plan file on 'horses' once, and

    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; probably not. <br>
    <br>
    Scotth@Turbine&gt; we'll always be tuning the game, and adjusting to what you 
    (the players) want. <br>

    <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="code"></a>State of 
	the Code Update</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">March 20, 
    2000</font></span></p>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>My 
	character is gone!!!</b><br>
	Don't panic! Due to maintenance and our minor game update (see below), we 
	needed to reset the AC worlds a few times in the last two weeks. Each time 
	we did so, we saw a rise in the incidence of characters that appeared to be 
	missing. This used to be a rare occurrence that we had dealt with on a 
	case-by-case basis, but now has become much more common. As a result, we 
	have suspended our non-urgent maintenance schedule until we fix the problem.
	<br>
	<br>
	All characters that fell victim to this bug are safe and will reappear soon. 
	They are not deleted; they simply have lost their connection to your Zone ID 
	in the database. We are restoring these characters every day, and will have 
	them all brought back as soon as possible. For more information, please 
	carefully read the system message on the character list screen, and follow 
	its instructions exactly. We're deeply sorry for the inconvenience. <br>
	<br>
	We are already testing a fix that will prevent this bug from haunting us 
	again. The fix will be implemented on or before our major update in the 
	first week of April. <br>
	<br>
	Please note that characters that are deleted due to the actions of a user -- 
	including the actions of a hacker who gains entry by one of the “Trojan 
	horse” account-stealing programs that are becoming popular -- will not be 
	restored. Protect yourself: thoroughly virus-scan all software you use from 
	anything less than a completely trustworthy source; use “firewall” software 
	or make sure your computer security is at its maximum; and do not have your 
	ZoneID be automatically saved on your system. Unfortunately, the Internet 
	still presents many security challenges beyond our control, but “safe 
	computing” practices will protect you from almost every threat. Learn more 
	at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/insider/internet/articles/security2.htm">
	http://www.microsoft.com/insider/internet/articles/security2.htm</a>. <br>
	<br>
	I seem to have “time warped” back since the last time I was playing!<br>
	Some players have reported that they enter the world to find that their 
	characters have “warped back in time”: they have the experience points, 
	items, and location that they had minutes or hours before the time when they 
	last left the game. In this way, recently acquired items can be lost. This 
	will happen to a small degree, a few minutes' worth, if you are online when 
	the world is reset. Therefore, always try to leave the world as soon as you 
	see a broadcast message in the game asking you to do so. However, some 
	players report having lost much more than a few minutes. We are making 
	headway on this bug, and apologize for the loss. <br>
	<br>
	<b>My items lost all of their mana charge!</b><br>
	On March 16, when we performed maintenance that restored many characters 
	that went missing (see above), the process had the unexpected side effect of 
	draining many items of their mana. We are investigating this to assure it 
	will not happen again. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Why has AC been “out of service” so much lately?</b><br>
	We've had a run of bad luck lately, and this forced us to keep the worlds 
	out of service much more than usual. We did so in order to restore missing 
	characters (see above), improve our database system, or do a minor update 
	(see below). From the day that it shipped in November, AC has had a 
	reputation for very little downtime, and we will earn that reputation again. 
	Please know that we take a world out of service only when it is in the best 
	interest of the players, and we wring our hands for every minute that Dereth 
	is not available to you. We promise to do better, and get back to our 
	previous pattern of only going out of service for a few hours each month in 
	order to perform major updates. <br>
