      As the Bronze Statues' assaults increased in regularity and power, Arcanum 
      researchers furiously continued their efforts to find some way to stop 
      these constructs. Before her disappearance, Nuhmudira, the former head of 
      the Arcanum, had become convinced that Asheron's people, the Empyreans, 
      were soon to return and immediately declare war. So passionate was she in 
      her speech against the Empyreans that many in the Arcanum had followed her 
      almost blindly. Yet now, with Nuhmudira still trapped in the ancient 
      Gelidite judgment device, the only help to the Arcanum in its darkest hour 
      came from an Empyrean. Asheron approached a group in a research center 
      established near the underground city of Xarabydun. When pressed, Asheron 
      would reveal little of why he had chosen to reveal himself now, but 
      fortunately, he was much more forthcoming with vital information on 
      ancient Empyrean transmutation techniques. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To aid the efforts of those seeking to stop 
    the statue assaults, Asheron shared information on how to create an Etheric 
    Seal, a device that would make a portion of a statue's pedestal base 
    permeable. With this information in hand, organized forces soon infiltrated 
    the underground foundries feeding these constructs and destroyed the guiding 
    mechanisms. As the last of the statues was nullified, grand fireworks 
    displays were seen in every town across the length and breadth of Dereth. 
    Defeated, the statues truly obtained to their makers' original intention: to 
    be monuments to the strength and abilities of the Isparian people. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron aided the Arcanum in another area of 
    its research. For months, the Arcanum had been searching for ways to improve 
    the Atlan weapons crafted from pyreal ingots. The Atlan weapons used during 
    the Shadow War millennia ago had been several orders of magnitude more 
    powerful than the ones Isparians now wielded. Researchers quickly became 
    convinced that this was due to two factors: first, the forging temperatures 
    of the Empyrean's Smith Golems were much higher than those of Silencia's 
    Golem; second, the ancient Empyrean pyreal ingots had contained richer 
    concentrations of mana. Many researchers had tried various methods to 
    circumvent these problems, but their efforts usually only resulted in ruined 
    pyreal ingots. To bypass one of these limitations and provide more mana for 
    the ingots, Asheron located a rich source of mana deep below the mountains 
    near Shoushi and then supplied the means to access it. In addition, Asheron 
    provided guidance in how to apply the mana to the ingots. He suggested 
    combining the raw mana obtained from the mana flow with diamond powder to 
    stabilize the mana enough to be applied to the ingots. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These two breakthroughs resulted in ingots of 
    superior quality, unlike anything seen before. To assist those searching for 
    this source of mana, and to provide additional direction in crafting the 
    weapons, Asheron instructed one of his Emissaries to appear in Eastham and 
    provide this information to any who asked. As with any new discovery, the 
    initial crafting of these new Isparian arms, as they came to be called, was 
    occasionally less than perfect. Soon, however, all could craft a weapon 
    unlike any Atlan that had come before. A side effect of using diamond powder 
    in the process made these weapon resistant to any outside enchantment, but 
    those who used them in battle reported that the Isparian arms could inflict 
    tremendous amounts of damage upon Elemental creatures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If not for the appearance of Martine, 
    Isparians might have begun to feel that they had defeated their unseen foe 
    and could begin to take their rest. With each appearance, though, the 
    ravings of Martine convinced everyone that they must yet keep vigilant. No 
    goal to his visits could be discerned. On some occasions, he would enlist 
    the Isparians' aid in destroying Virindi elements that had broken away from 
    his control; on others, he would demanded a tax of Singularity Keys. If 
    anyone was fool enough to attack him, they quickly found themselves at their 
    Lifestone. The tale was even told of his appearance at a marriage ceremony, 
    and some felt that his babbling indicated he was in love with Queen Elysa 
    Strathelar. Researchers in the Arcanum also took note of an element he 
    seemed to repeat over and over in some of his appearances. He kept saying 
    that the Empyreans were trapped, and their life force was somehow being 
    sustained by the Isparians. Many wondered if this could indeed be the truth. 
    Or were these just the nonsensical ravings of his mind? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though the assaults had stopped, many 
    felt as unsure about what was to come as they had at the beginning of the 
    month. Did Asheron's actions prove he could be trusted? Or was the insane 
    Martine right in declaring Asheron a fool and a tyrant oppressing the 
    Isparian people? These questions sharply divided the people, but only time 
    would tell who was right. For the moment, all they could do was prepare for 
    the battle they were sure was coming. <br>
