		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=292">
		Turbine Site</a> - Oct. 14, 2004<br>
&nbsp;</font></span><div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Who are you?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm Dave Javier, lead designer on the <em>
		Asheron's Call: Throne of Destiny</em> expansion pack.&nbsp; And lo, have I 
		walked this road before.&nbsp; I spent two years on the AC1 Live team, from 
		ship to fall of 2001, with ten months as the lead designer there. </font>
		</p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What do you actually do?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My day is long and varied.&nbsp; There is time 
		spent wrangling the schedule, discussing issues with the artists and 
		engineers, consulting with my fellow designers.&nbsp; We're responsible for 
		the content going into the expansion pack – from spec'ing and 
		implementing quests to height-mapping the new archipelago chain, not to 
		mention thinking up a bunch of names that sound sort of French and sort 
		of Italian but aren't really...&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of my task is also to aid in the 
		ongoing archive project, where we assemble all the game knowledge that 
		used to be part of a vast and sometimes complicated &quot;oral tradition&quot; and 
		put it into documents for future team members' use.&nbsp; We've also put in 
		time coordinating the cinematic intro.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">How did you end up here?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I got hired the old-fashioned way: 
		exploiting the Old Boy network!&nbsp; I was fresh out of college, my summer 
		job was about to end, and I had spent more time playing in and running 
		role-playing games than was healthy.&nbsp; One of my college friends, Justin 
		Quimby, had been working at Turbine for a year and he told me that they 
		were shipping this crazy new &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; game soon, and they 
		were going to need people to put together quests and stuff for monthly 
		updates.&nbsp; I submitted an application, complete with a sample dungeon on 
		graph paper and quest write-up, and got an interview.&nbsp; They liked me 
		enough to make me an offer, and I started on the Live team a week before 
		the game shipped.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After my two year stint on the Live team, 
		I moved on to spend a year on AC2 development, where I did most of the 
		terraforming for the Lugian continent and contributed bits of landscape 
		and lore work wherever else it was needed.&nbsp; After that, I went on to the 
		Middle-Earth Online team, where I did things I probably am bound not to 
		discuss by NDA.&nbsp; After about a year and a half there, the opportunity 
		came up to work on the Throne of Destiny expansion pack, and I leaped at 
		the chance.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your favorite quest in 
			Asheron's Call and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Drudge Fight!&nbsp; The first rule of Drudge 
		Fight is that you don't talk about Drudge Fight, but finding the gem on 
		a Drudge Stalker's corpse gave me this thrill of the unexpected... which 
		going into the Drudge Fight dungeon reinforced with some fast and 
		furious action.&nbsp; I love my new championship belt!</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your least favorite monster 
			and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Any critter that starts furiously healing 
		and draining as it gets low on health.&nbsp; Invariably I end up screaming at 
		the screen, &quot;Fight like a <i>man</i>, punk!&quot;&nbsp; Which I follow up a minute 
		or so later with, &quot;Oh, not so tough without all your mana, huh?&nbsp; Huh?&quot;</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Where did you get your nickname?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is the nickname I used when I first 
		joined the AC Live&nbsp;team five years ago... I needed a nickname to post on 
		the original Crossroads of Dereth boards, and a handle for use on the 
		Zone.&nbsp; Without putting much thought into it, I went with &quot;Crowley.&quot;&nbsp; A 
		lot of people think I am channeling Aliester Crowley, the 
		turn-of-the-century English occultist.&nbsp; In reality I just stole the name 
		from the novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett – which 
		is kind of a British humor version of the Apocalypse.&nbsp; Crowley was the 
		name of a minor demon that'd been sent to earth to make a little 
		trouble, and had been on the job so long he'd gone native.&nbsp; I loved the 
		character, found him very witty and entertaining, so I used the name.&nbsp; 
		Now, I recognize that his name may well have been derived from the 
		real-life Crowley, but I figure it's an important distinction that I 
		took my cue from Gaiman and Pratchett, not from English occultism.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the way, I do not have the name 
		&quot;Crowley&quot; on any retail servers... But I do have variants of the name.</font><br>
