    scared,”Cortrima said, her eyes wide and shimmering with tears of panic.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">“Shh,”her mother said, and 
    wrapped her arms tighter around the girl. They were huddled in one corner of 
    the room. Crude furniture barricaded the door and windows. Outside their 
    little cabin, the howling grew louder, shriller. They had fled when the 
    Spire first erupted from the ground. After a few weeks of inactivity, 
    though, they had thought it safe to return.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">The change had begun two 
    days ago. The noise from the Spire had escalated, and the ground had quaked. 
    Cortrima's father, a mage, had clutched his head in pain during the quakes, 
    and finally run into the woods, screaming about shifting currents, about 
    thorns in the flesh of the earth -- things they did not understand. The 
    black shape on the northern horizon appeared more frequently, leering down 
    through bruise-colored overcast and blood-red sun.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Then the Shadows began to 
    appear, their eyes burning with power. They now surrounded the house in 
    numbers that grew by the hour, whispering in a way that set her hair on end. 
    From the Spire itself, sick wet sounds could occasionally be heard -- as if 
    something were hatching in the bone protrusion at its apex.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">“What do they 
    want?”Cortrima's mother whispered, half to herself. “For the love of the 
    Mothers, what do they want?”</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Sibilant laughter washed 
    over the house. The wind shivered the trees with dire news. A storm had been 
    building over Dereth for a month. Soon it would break -- and black rain 
    would fall.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">In our continuing commitment 
    to bring you a major world-altering event each month, we will soon present 
    &quot;Thorns of the Hopeslayer.&quot; Twisted citadels erupted from the earth several 
    weeks ago, and have since hovered over the land, humming with evil magic. 
    Some invisible force has periodically teleported heroes into their heights 
    and subjected them to a menacing interrogation. What evil being prepares to 
    assault Dereth? Is there truly a connection between the Shadow creatures 
    gathering in the wilderness and these citadels that adventurers call the 
    Shadow Spires? Sometime during the first week of April, the designs of a 
    great evil will be set in motion. Prepare now for the defense!</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">The Shadows, thought by the foolish to be in retreat,
    reveal that they are merely gathering for a final assault upon Dereth. Reports from spies
    have been incoherent, as if horror has rendered them senseless. Arm now! Attack may come
    at any time from any quarter, at first far from civilization, but in danger of stretching
    nearer to home. Asaina al-Arqis and other scholars have surmised that the goal of the
    Shadows is not merely victory but the spread of terror and despair. Do not be lulled by
    early success nor disheartened by the reappearance of the enemy as their tactics change.
    When the battle is joined, take the fight to their captains, wherever they may lurk, and
    punish them. All adventurers of all skill levels will be needed, and many can hope to
    their names written into the annals! </font> </p>
    <p><font size="2">This month's major event, &quot;The Thorns of the
    Hopeslayer,&quot; is upon us. In this pivotal conflict with darkness, the actions of the
    players will alter the course of events on a scale never before seen in an online game.
    Players who make special efforts to turn the tide will have their name broadcast for all
    to admire. This battle is not just for those of high level - some stages will require the
    participation of less advanced players. Join the defense! For more

    </span></b></font><b><font size="2">April 4, 2000 </font></b> </p>
    
    <p><font size="2">Here are all the tiny little details of the game update 
    that was made on April 4, 2000. This list is culled from &quot;check-in&quot; notes 
    submitted by the game developers themselves. Things of greatest note are 
    listed first. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Some changes are not in these build notes, because that 
    would spoil the fun of finding all that has been added or changed! Some 
    changes include major new things players can do to drive our evolving story 
    forward, which we won't entirely reveal here. As usual, the Town Criers, 
    Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the trades of crafting 
    and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items 
    are not always detailed here. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Detailed Notes for builds 2311-2318: </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">The stage is set for an unparalleled battle! Travelers, 
      beware of Shadows, and look for heroes among you who can determine the 
      fate of the lands of Dereth. </li>
      <li>&quot;Detached characters&quot; (which recently caused some characters to 
      temporarily appear missing) should now be a thing of the past. All 
      characters that were not truly deleted will now appear in your character 
      list. Some long-past characters may show up in this way. In some rare 
      cases, you may have more characters than can show up in your character 
      list. If your character slots are filled and you still think a character 
      is missing, delete an unwanted character and wait for the &quot;temporarily 
      unavailable&quot; label to vanish. This will allow one &quot;overflow&quot; character to 
      show up. If you still feel a character is missing, read the &quot;State of the 
      Code&quot; article. </li>
      <li>&quot;Infused&quot; pyreal ingots (used for Atlan weapons) can no longer be 
      given to others! Before, there was a loophole where a player with a high 
      weapon skill could use a glyph to stamp (or &quot;infuse&quot;) the ingot to yield 
      higher quality, then give it to a not-so-skilled player, who could get a 
      superior weapon. We had to tolerate this until we fixed a bug. Now, you 
      can NOT give the infused ingot to anyone else -- the future owner of the 
      Atlan weapon will have to use the glyph on it him- or herself. Note that 
      you can still have a skilled Alchemist form the ingot to begin with, and 
      give the ingot away. In other words, non-infused pyreal ingots still can 
      be traded among players freely. </li>
      <li>Experience point distribution within fellowships is generally more 
      fair and logical. Before, which member of the fellowship made the kill 
      affected how much XP was generated. If the kill was made by a fellow who 
      was much higher level than the victim, the whole group's XP was reduced. 
      Now, just the XP for the higher-level members is reduced. However, the 
      flipside is also true: if a low-level fellow makes the kill on a victim of 
      equal level, that fellow will get a non-reduced share of XP, but fellows 
      that are higher level will get reduced XP. In most fellowship adventuring, 
      less XP will be lost than was lost with the old system. </li>
      <li>Fixed was a recently discovered (by us) bug that justified cries of 
      &quot;kill stealing.&quot; We didn't understand these protests before, since the 
      system was designed to give loot rights to whoever did the most damage, 
      and XP division was proportional to the amount of damage done. However, we 
      recently realized that damage above and beyond the victim's remaining hit 
      points were being fully counted! Therefore, player A could fight a monster 
      with 100 hit points, gradually do 60 points of damage, then have player B 
      swoop in, kill the monster with one 70-point blow, and find that player B 
      got loot rights and the majority of the XP. But player B didn't really do 
      70 points of damage; the monster only had 40 ht points to lose. This is 
      now fixed, and in this scenario, player B will get credit for just the 40 
      points of damage, while player A will get credit for 60 points, and 
      therefore get loot rights and the majority of the XP. This is not done as 
      a balancing measure: we honestly thought it was working this way all 
      along. It was designed this way, therefore this is a bug that needed to be 
      fixed. </li>
      <li>Due to a bug fix, Crystal creatures are now more likely to attack by 
      using bludgeoning damage. Therefore, during melee combat, Crystal 
      creatures may be a bit more damaging than before if you are not well 
      protected against bludgeoning. </li>
      <li>New technology enables players to affect worldwide properties as part 
      of major events. You thought events were good before? That was nothin' 
      compared to this stuff. And this is just the beginning. </li>
      <li>New technology to enable announcement and log-recording of players who 
      accomplish major tasks in worldwide event quests. </li>
      <li>Exitless room in Ancient Lighthouse dungeon -- added a lever to this 
      room! </li>
      <li>Door facing wrong way in Mountain Fortress dungeon -- fixed. </li>
      <li>NPCs now will give items to you, even if your option is set not to 
      take items from other players. </li>
      <li>There are rumors of a bloody assassination of a well-known master of 
      his art . . . Surely this is not the end of this drama. </li>
      <li>PK players can't heal monsters with healkits anymore. This was an 
      annoying loophole that allowed PKs to harass NPK players. </li>
      <li>Pyreal Motes, Slivers, Nuggets, Bars and Ingots now look like they 
      should on the ground and in their icons. They didn't used to. They all 
      looked like Twinkies. Now they all look different. </li>
      <li>Fixed the bug where locks always appraise as &quot;trivial.&quot; </li>
      <li>Spring long past sprung; Bunnies not so busy. </li>
      <li>Night ambience is now brighter, by around 12%. </li>
      <li>Mana Stones now have icons that better reflect their power levels. 
      This applies mostly to charged stones you buy from vendors. Instead of 
      looking the same in their icons, making it harder to tell them apart in a 
      bag of stones, they now have icons that reflect the power levels. </li>
      <li>Sho &amp; Gharu'ndim bowyers buy fletching items. The bowyers in Al-Jalima, 
      Stonehold, and Yaraq sold lockpicks as well as bowyer stuff. They will 
      also buy lockpicks along with bowyer/fletching stuff. </li>
      <li>Now only you hear noise when you sell something to a vendor. You won't 
      hear the sales of others. </li>
      <li>Rope bridge supports are no longer see-through in dungeons. </li>
      <li>Magma Golem light is brightened towards red more. </li>
      <li>Most Atlan Staff weapons were being held incorrectly. Too far towards 
      the base. Fixed. </li>
      <li>Shoushi Grotto -- Reduced lighting in several rooms and most hallways. 
      This dungeon was too bright. </li>
      <li>The undead Baron of Colier no longer leaves his Electric Long Sword on 
      his corpse. </li>
      <li>Added missing acid pool to a pit in the Incunabula dungeon. </li>
      <li>Special vats, fonts, pools, fountains, and wells now cast their old 
      spells on players when used. When a flask is used on these objects you 
      will get a flask of water. Double the usage, double the fun! </li>
      <li>Casting portal recall spells now make you play some purple bubbly 
      physics scripts for about two seconds before blipping you away. </li>
      <li>Target drudges in festival grounds don't give old cheese for loot now. 
      Oops. Yes, the days of free cheese are sadly at an end. Blame the Shadows.
      </li>
      <li>Amullian coat no longer has humpback. </li>
      <li>Flowers have been thinned out Dereth-wide. <br>

    - April Edition</span></font></span></b></font></p>
    
    <p><font size="2">Well, another month has zipped by and, lo and behold, it's 
    time for another Spin article to let all of you know what we're up to, and 
    why we've done what we've done. </p>
    <p>It's been great reading the boards since the invasion started. Sure, 
    there are complaints of isolated lag and some places that are super tough or 
    crowded, but overall many of you really liked what you've seen so far this 
    month. For us, it was a huge challenge to build and we weren't sure if you'd 
    appreciate it or not. To all those who have and posted as such, I thank you 
    on behalf of the design team. Eri, Dave, Jesse, and Chris did a great job in 
    getting all the stuff done. Of course, without others like Elliot and the QA 
    team giving 110%, we wouldn't have gotten anything to happen! Big thanks to 
    all the tech &amp; support guys as well for making the prop pretty painless, and 
    fixing a bunch of bugs along with making some improvements (did I hear a 
    shout of joy from people who are in fellowships?). </p>
    <p>As you can probably tell, there's been a bit of work on the Zone side to 
    keep the game up and running as smoothly as possible. We've been working 
    with them to sort out any problems and make servicing the worlds as painless 
    as possible. Both Turbine and MS hate bringing the game down at any time, 
    and we do try to do it only as needed. But there are occasionally things 
    that crop up that need immediate attention and force us to do so. Most of 
    the downtimes have to deal with server maintenance -- making sure that 
    everything is being backed up correctly and without problems. There have 
    been some changes to that system in the last few weeks, and hopefully, the 
    outages that are happening will be much less frequent as we go on. </p>
    <p>The team is looking forward to May now, and is busy building the event 
    (even though there's still more to come in April!). As I look through our 
    bug-tracking system, I see we've got a bunch of bugs that need fixing. Some 
    are fairly serious; some are variants of others . . . </p>
    <p>Example of a fairly low-priority, trivial bug: <i>“Backstory: Want to put 
    in more backstory stories into the world.”</i> </p>
    <p>Example of a fairly significant bug that merits attention and resources 
    to fix: <i>“SERVER CRASH: HashBase&lt;unsigned __int64&gt;::clobber”</i> </p>
    <p>Most of the problems that people talk about on the discussion boards are 
    the ones we're trying to fix in the next few updates, things like: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>skill curves (both general changes and distinctions to 
      specialized/trained curves) </li>
      <li>fixes for swords </li>
      <li>upping monster loot </li>
      <li>stuff for mages (improvements to the spell bar), since the last few 
      months we were doling out stuff to warriors </li>
      <li>a gaggle of other fixes </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As for the skill-curve stuff, we will be very careful making this change. 
    If we don't have enough time to adequately test it, we'll hold off until we 
    feel 100% confident. I figure you want something done right the first time 
    you see it rather than having us introduce something buggy (sorry about 
    doing that in the past -- we want to avoid that in the future) and go back 
    in and remove it. </p>
    <p>The overall system changes will be minor tweaks, since we don't want to 
    screw up the game balance or upset everyone. Like we've always tried to do, 
    we'd rather make smaller changes rather than huge changes that have to be 
    toned down (i.e., nerfed) afterwards. Some of the changes and bug fixes 
    we're making affect what goes on behind the scenes. </p>
    <p>By the way, why is it that whenever we add something that affects a bunch 
    of people in a positive way, others complain about being nerfed? All the 
    changes we've got planned for May should be beneficial to you, no matter 
    what your level or class. And yes, we'll still be adding more stuff (quests 
    and such) as always. </p>
    <p>Anyway, Oswald says I have to go now. </font></p>

    Zone</a></span></p>
    <p><i>April 11, 2000</i> </p>
    <p>As you know, Asheron's Call has the unique distinction of providing its 
    players with a world that undergoes major changes each month, immersing 
    everyone in a grand plot. The wicked work of the Gelidites plunged Dereth 
    into a sudden winter, which was stopped when brave players shattered the 
    Great Work, a crystal that was sucking the heat from the land. A beautiful 
    spring spread over Dereth, and a huge obsidian bridge, apparently concealed 
    by the ancient Empyrean, appeared over the River Prosper, much to the 
    delight of travelers. However, a new scourge arose, perhaps also triggered 
    by the destruction of the Great Work: deadly Crystal Fragments and horrible 
    Shadow creatures beset adventurers in the wilderness. Sages uncovered clues 
    enabling them to reconstruct the ancient Atlan weapons, forged of old to 
    defeat a similar invasion of Shadows. Skilled smiths examined the weapons 
    and used certain principles of their design to create new armor, using the 
    gemlike substances left behind by Shadows and Crystals. Meanwhile, menacing 
    spire citadels erupted from the earth to loom over several towns, and some 
    swore that a chilling, invisible presence teleported them up into these 
    spires to ask maddening questions. Doubts as to the sanity of the 
    “abductees” remain. </p>
    <p>This month, the world seemed to grow calm for a time . . . but it was the 
    calm before the storm. The gibbering of long-range scouts led some to 
    suspect the worst was yet to come. They were justified in their fear. Read 
    the following tale of a Blademaster who saw the action firsthand. </p>
    <p><i>Our greatest fears have been realized. The cursed Shadows have invaded 
    Dereth in their greatest show of force to date! A chill went down my spine 
    as my fellowship and I heard the following whispers: “In the dark of the 
    obsidian wasteland, where great magics wrought destruction long ago, the 
    Shadows stir and awaken. The Hand stretches forth once more . . .”Obsidian 
    wasteland? That sounded like an apt description of where we were: the 
    Obsidian Plain in the southern Direlands! In fear, not wishing to be 
    anywhere near this “stretching Hand,”we ran northward. Just as we were 
    starting to feel foolish for our flight, the sizzle of emerging enemies 
    surrounded us, and we were staring into the blank faces of the Shadows, 
    voids which walk in human form. We fought bravely, but soon, battered and 
    drained, we retreated pell-mell to Fort Tethana, which was massed with 
    defenders. After I recovered somewhat, I went to a local mage and was just 
    in the process of buying mana stones, when a great commotion erupted. A 
    dread Shadow Captain appeared within the walls of the Fort! We quickly found 
    it to be as strong as a Panumbris, and just as in my previous encounters 
    with an enemy of such might, I was quickly dispatched to a Lifestone.</i>
    </p>
    <p><i>As I ran back to Tethana, I heard new words on the winds: “The 
    darkness has been checked in the Northern Direlands. The brave defenders of 
    Fort Tethana have prevailed!”I even heard the name of the mage that laid the 
    killing blow to the Shadow Captain. (He belongs to a rival allegiance, so I 
    hesitate to add to his glory.) However, I also heard this dying utterance 
    from our foe: “The tides of war shift . . . another captain shall appear, 
    perhaps in a different settlement . . .”I soon arrived back at the fort, 
    where the fallen were visiting their corpses alongside me. As we talked 
    excitedly about this turn of events, my patron sent me a message: though the 
    Shadows were slowing their attack near Tethana, presumably due to the death 
    of their Captain, a new invasion had begun in the desert and the swamps of 
    the Direlands. Then my friends from afar told me they saw waves of the enemy 
    near the northern bridge from the Direlands to Osteth. “The Shadows are 
    reaching eastward!”cried a sorceress. Her alarm only added to mine, and I 
    sensed a panic among those who wanted to flee the invasion, and a frenzy 
    among those who wanted to resist it. My fellowship and I wanted to fight, 
    and as we traveled, we heard the rumor that another Captain -- or the same 
    one, back from the dead? -- was terrorizing the town of Plateau.</i> </p>
    <p><i>My stout vassal, herself an axe warrior, hefting her newly acquired 
    Silifi of Crimson Stars, urged us to skip Plateau, for surely the battle 
    against that Captain would be over before we arrived. “Where will they 
    strike next?”she mused, as we all seemed to instinctively know that epic 
    events come in threes. She scrutinized her map. “Tethana . . . Plateau . . . 
    What is next in line?”We said together: “Stonehold!”We ran onward, sped by a 
    helpful enchanter who lightened our feet. As we traveled, we heard ringing 
    in the air another pronouncement that my patron had defeated the Captain in 
    Plateau, and that now Mt. Esper was under threat. I sent hasty 
    congratulations, but I ached for a battle of my own, despite the doom that 
    awaited me.</i> </p>
    <p><i>As we approached Stonehold, we met again with the armies of the void. 
    We were seized by bloodlust -- or lust for whatever flowed in those things 
    -- and fought more skillfully than we ever had before. We scarcely paused to 
    loot the fallen as we made for Stonehold. The town bustled with adventurers 
    girding for battle, but none stayed for long -- they ran off to fight their 
    foes in the surrounding countryside. We remained close to town, helping 
    frightened folk too ill-prepared to survive the trek outward, but always 
    returning to the main square. Just as we were doubting the wisdom of our 
    plan, we heard a sickening crackle, and suddenly, right next to me, stood 
    the negated form of the Shadow Captain.</i> </p>
    <p><i>Why I did not run I do not know, and even less do I understand how I 
    survived. I owe my life to a selfless Life Mage who healed and refreshed me 
    over and over, bringing me always back from the brink of death. In my frenzy 
    I slashed the Captain again and again, buffeted by her spells, but 
    determined to beat my enemy or die trying. My fellowship dug in as well, 
    though the Captain seemed only to desire my blood. Finally, with one mighty 
    blow, I cleft her in twain. This time I heard my own name trumpeted to the 
    skies, and along with the cheers of those around me, I received messages of 
    congratulations and wonderment from seemingly everyone in Dereth. I have 
    never felt so exhilarated.</i> </p>
    <p>The best is yet to come, everyone! Stay vigilant, for no one can tell the 
    day when the next blow will fall, or from where. One hint though . . . <i>
    <b>we will never make masses of monsters invade a town</b></i>! Though it is 
    an exciting notion, to do so creates “hotspots” of player density that have 
    a negative effect on gameplay. Fort Tethana was not singled out for 
    “invasion,” having only the usual random scattering of foes nearby, but 
    everyone in the Direlands ran to the Fort with Shadows on their tail, 
    thereby making it look like the invasion they feared! If you are looking for 
    an intense battle with the smoothest play, seek it out in the open, not in a 
    crowded town. Yes, for drama there may be times when an enemy or two appear 
    briefly in a town, but it won't be easy to figure out where -- and as our 
    story above relates, the invasion leaders can shift tactics at any moment. 
    Keep adventuring abroad, come to town to restock, and head out once again 
    into the breach!</p>

    <p>MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Welcome once again to our Monthly Asheron's Call 
    Developer's Chat<span lang="en-us">. </span>Before we get started, just a 
    reminder of the rule: </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>1. Please limit yourself to one question per person. If you ask multiple 
    questions, we will only be able to answer your first <br>
    2. Please have your question typed out ahead of time and ready to 
    cut-n-paste when it is your turn </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Both of these are in an effort to allow the most people 
    a chance to ask questions. Without further delay, I would like to introduce the 
    Co-Lead Designer of Asheron's Call, Eri Izawa. Eri, take it away! </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; OK! I'm Eri &quot;reijin&quot; Izawa, co-lead designer on AC. Thanks to 
    all of you for coming! I'm having trouble with my cut-n-paste :) First, the 
    introductions. With me from the Design Team are: Jesse &quot;Nei&quot; Kurlancheek, scriptor &amp; balancer extraordinaire. Dave &quot;Sausage King of Dereth&quot; Javier. If you see saucy 
    dialogue, you know whose it is! Lead Designer Chris Foster may be joining us 
    later. Dave Namerow is our Turbine Community Dude. </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Mind you, he's not a d00d. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; And we also have guest stars Sean and Sean! Sean Huxter is Lead Artist for AC. </p>
    <p>sean@Turbine&gt; Ssssup? </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (let's hear it for Sean ...) </p>
    <p>spd@Turbine&gt; Hiya, I'm Qa liscious </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; And spd, Sean Dickinson, is &quot;QA guy&quot; to quote him. 
    We may also have a guest appearance of Scott Herrington, AC Producer. That's 
    it! </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; OK, our first two questions are from ppl that got 
    dropped earlier today... </p>

    <p><b>Zephaman&gt; sorry i was just watching </b> </p>
    <p><b>Zephaman&gt; i do have a question </b> </p>
    <p><b>Zephaman&gt; i have heard about the lower lvl players having impact on 
    recent events </b> </p>
    <p><b>Zephaman&gt; with the current events of shadow attacks, what types of things 
    can the lower lvl guys be expected to do to participate </b> </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Keep your pants on... There will be stuff for lowlevel 
    players, that ONLY they can do. But you understand I can't go into 
    specifics. </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Let's just say low-level and mid-level players will play 
    a &quot;key role.&quot; </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (BTW, he just had to say &quot;pants&quot;) </p>

    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Nei's typing </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; this is partially due to the 150% bonus on archery and 
    partially due to the /5 of missle D as opposed to /3 of melee D... we know 
    about it. we're also very leery of changing existing monsters. however, 
    expect the newer monsters to be more balanced in ... </p>
    <p>sean@Turbine&gt; ...with a chopstick. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; terms of what can kill them and at what skill lvl. </p>

    to AC, I love how you can be recognized in game for accomplishments.. anyway 
    on to my question... </b> </p>
    <p><b>DeHaanian&gt; Like many players.... I WANT A MATTY ROBE.... In pvp these 
    robes are extremely powerfull as with buffs they are almost inpenetrable.. 
    do you plan on reintroducing any kind of armored robe.. Or will you balence 
    the robe to PvP since anyone with it is a go </b> </p>
    <p><b>DeHaanian&gt; Thanks, and I can't wait to see some new portal spells and 
    that quest bow...... ok wishful thinking :), Thanks Turbine guys :) </b> </p>
    <p><b>DeHaanian&gt; mmmmm quest bow... </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; The matty robe was a little unbalancing... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Don't expect anything quite like it. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; However, we'd like to add more robes and other such things 
    to the game as we continue.... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p><b>Zeraphan&gt; I would like to start off by saying how much I love this game

    <p><b>Zeraphan&gt; and patch has been for melee fighters (atlan weapons, Shadow

    <p><b>Zeraphan&gt; I was wondering if you would tell us more specifically when 
    mages should look for our updates, or if not when, a better idea of what we 
    should look forward to seeing in these updates. Thank you. Long Live The 
    Illuminati. ga </b> </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; Eris says hi.... Mages will get their dues &quot;real soon now&quot;. 
    New classes of spells will be introduced to the world. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; Mages everywhere will rejoice at their new found powers... 
    harder hitting, faster flying, and all around kinda pretty looking. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; done. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Don't expect them right away, though. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (It's my job to spoil the fun a little bit ;) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; But they're coming. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p><b>Binky413&gt; There has been a rather large debate about the 
    specialization/training issue. The issue is what bonuses should be given to 
    skills that are specialized. . . </b> </p>
    <p><b>Binky413&gt; At this time there doesn't appear to be *any* reason to 
    specialize a skill due to the lack of bonuses. Specialization costs a huge 
    amount for the little gains that are currently obtained. . . </b> </p>
    <p><b>Binky413&gt; What, if anything, is currently being done to fix this problem? 
    GA </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; We're well aware of this issue. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; *sigh* my eyes hurt today from staring at spreadsheets... my 
    math brain isn't up to par anymore. But the spec issue is being addressed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Binky413&gt; BTW: Get your mattie robes on ebay! </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; He's looking at the spreadsheets I made, so of course he's 
    going blind. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; Spec'd skills will slowly rise above trained skills as the 
    lvl increases. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; done. </p>
    <p><b>NightWolf_ES&gt; Currently, there is some sort of problem with the 
    chests/ground spawns. many people believe this was intentional &quot;nerfing&quot;.
    </b>
    </p>
    <p><b>NightWolf_ES&gt; Please please please tell me this is a bug, and that its' 
    being fixed. PLEASE! Not everyone can kill nobles and Umbris shadows! </b> </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; How many questions you asking tonight, RoRo? :) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Yes, there's a bug with spawns. </p>
    <p><b>NightWolf_ES&gt; BTW, Servers are too crowded, open up new ones for the New 
    people in UK! =] </b> </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; There (re)spawns are a bug.. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Note: we will have to address some of the camping problems 
    with some chests, but the current problem is distinctly a bug. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; done. </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; it wasn't an intentional effect, but if a chest is not 
    respawning right now, if you leave the area for some time, it will reload 
    and the chest/items should respawn </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; done. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (You ALL have to leave though) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (done) </p>
    <p><b>Urborn2die&gt; How come everytime a outdoor olthoi hunting/perch spot is 
    found, within a months time it is changed or the olthoi are removed 
    completely ? ....and may i asked 1 more ? </b> </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Sorry, have to limit to one question </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Sometimes in really problematic cases, the perching is 
    abusive enough that we have to regulate and change the monster placement or 
    effect some other change. </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; It's not a general policy, but we look at things on a 
    case-by-case basis. We're looking to make things balanced, not abusive. And 
    it is not our policy to &quot;nerf.&quot; </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Done </p>
    <p><b>Gringle&gt; In a very recent update on The Zone (AC section) this statement

    people need to 'be prepared', or even care, if Shadows are only going to 
    massively assault places in the middle of nowhere, and not towns? -Chunkystew 
    of Morningthaw (shameless plug) </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Well, towns are not exempt from all action. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; It's just that to be fair to players we can't do something 
    that will egregiously make a town very bad for long. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Also -- and this is just an example, mind you -- would you 
    like it if the whole of Dereth crawled with shadows? </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Yeek! </p>
    <p>Dave@turbine&gt; ouch! </p>

    is here. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hiya! </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Rithel, you are up </p>
    <p><b>dhtaylor&gt; I'm sure that there are many out there like me. I wasted a lot 
    of skill points at creation and tried to play through it. Have you ever 
    considered adding quests that would allow players to receive a skill point 
    upon completion. </b> </p>
    <p><b>dhtaylor&gt; You could limit it to once per person. Even one skill point at 
    high level would be very helpful. The difference between getting a new skill 
    at level 50 rather than 55 is immense. Thanks for your time. </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Why, yes, it's under consideration. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; There are some serious concerns about the ramifications, 
    however. </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; == FYI - We are aware of connection problems in Darktide 
    and are investigating. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; And we really would prefer to balance things out so that you 
    don't feel like you've wasted your credits. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; But we are taking it seriously. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; BTW, Sorry I'm late. I was busy making myself a high 
    king in Thistledown. And if _I_ can make High King, you know something's up 
    with the system. :) </p>
    <p><b>thundercat_8&gt; i have a question and a suggestion all roled into 
    one....can you program something so common allegiance players can see each 
    other on radar,,,like fellowship is green , PK is red, maybe blue for 
    allegiance or something? and are you going to open newworlds </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; First question. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; I'll take that one. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; The way allegiance is coded, your machine doesn't know 
    the status of its entire allegiance by default; that was done for bandwidth 
    reasons, mainly; given the size of these structures, and how dynamic they 
    are, tracking the changes on-line is a lot of... </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... bits to transmit. That makes color-coding 
    allegiances pretty tough with the current system. We'd have to reengineer 
    some fundamental tech for it. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; In other words, it ain't just paintin' dots. :) done </p>
    <p><b>RaunTaiAon&gt; Wassssup? Love the game. You realy worked hard on the history 
    and Lore. It is more addicting then the game sometimes. I was wondering 
    1.)Is the &quot;Shadow Key&quot; that is suppoesed to open the doors in the nexus even 
    in the game yet and has anyone found it?... </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Oh, and I guess I'll blab about allegiances somewhat -- 
    stop pokin' me with that stick, Rei! </p>
    <p><b>RaunTaiAon&gt; And if so is it called the &quot;Shadow Key&quot;? 2.) Why did you nerf 
    all the good chests in the game? Frore, crater, etc. Stormwaltz rocks. ga
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Doh! Sorry, Raun. I'll wait my turn again. *snif* </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I'll take that. </p>
    <p><b>RaunTaiAon&gt; hehe </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; It's in the game, but it's not IN the game. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; MY TURN! WAAGH! </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Can we get Foster a little space here? </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Whoo! </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Before he explodes :) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; *pop* </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; oops </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Anyhoo... </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... we know that something funky is up with allegiances, 
    and we've figured out a fix for it. While the problem doesn't affect 
    gameplay in any serious ways, it DOES make it much harder for the game to 
    reflect someone's status in the world. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; And for that reason, the bug is disappointing. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; As I said, we have a fix on the way; in the meantime, 
    judge each person's rank with a critical eye, for their power may be 
    fleeting... </p>

    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; So it'd be a nice aesthetic and very cool to have, but

    <p><b>geniusclown&gt; 1) fix the death-on-a-steep-hill problem by introducing a

    is there a way members of a large standing army (ie a well organized 
    monarchy like The Silver Citadel [www.silvercitadel.com]) can send a message 
    to, say, the Shadow Colonal, and request a forma </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Ooh! A question! :) </p>
    <p><b>geniusclown&gt; ....a formal battle? </b> </p>
    <p><b>geniusclown&gt; It would be fun to try to organize and a full-scale army of 
    50 or so people and lay siege on a rival army. </b> </p>
    <p><b>geniusclown&gt; &lt;grin done. </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; we're huddling here... </p>
    <p>sean@Turbine&gt; Wait. Isn't this called &quot;snuggling?&quot; </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; ooh. that explains the harassment suit coming on. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; First of all, we are under some constraints when it comes to 
    favoring one world, or one group of players, over another. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Secondly... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; We also very much try to avoid encouraging crowding. 50 
    people in battle is (as some of you know) pretty laggy. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; To do this right would be a whole new &quot;allegiance wars&quot; 
    system; we've wanted to do something like that for a while, but it's a BIG 
    chunk of work. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; It also has the drawback of being REALLY cool for people 
    who like PK in whatever form, or heavy-duty social role-playing, but it 
    doesn't do much for the lone-wolves out there, or the the PvP-averse. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (50 people against a rival army ... 100 people casting 
    spells and fighting ... ) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; So it ends up being a lower priority than something of 
    equal size that can benefit everyone in the game, like property ownership

    <p><b>lucidconcepts&gt; All done </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; It may be possible to reach any number of islands in the 
    future. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; If you read Game Developer, you probably know that. :)
    </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Some of them before others. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Hmmm, how can I be more vague? </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Don't use vowels. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Seriously, though, the next island may not be one you 
    expect. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p><b>Magnum_Load&gt; Hello, I'd would like to congradulate Turbine on a VERY well 
    done job, and would like to address the issue of Mules, and having possible 
    storage space in AC. Any word? </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Yes. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Well, no </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; But yes </p>
    <p><b>Magnum_Load&gt; lol. :) </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; THAT's Vaguer! Yay! </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I'm seriously looking into it. We've been held up by some 
    unforeseen complications.... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (And it really IS a big task, the more we look at it) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; So the upshot is that it's higher up the queue than ever 
    before. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; cnj </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; arch? </p>
    <p><b>Archemist&gt; As a monarch of over 200 people, I want to see something done 
    to give monarchs, of some size, some real TRUE power in the game. What is 
    going to be done to increase the importance of rank besides being just a 
    basic pyramid scheme and/or arcane lore?? </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; cnj? </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; I'll take that one. </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Secret code </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Both our plans for allegiance wars and property 
    ownership will involve allegiances in a significant way </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Both are areas where large groups of players can be 
    recognized, and have a tangible effect on the world </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; We want to explore the allegiance system further. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; More details as either of these turn more solid. (done)
    </p>
    <p><b>GoD_FiNiXX&gt; I want to know why archers and warriors are so strong mages 
    are crap u alrdy gave archer the DM at 112% plus the BD'S so as the 
    warriors, they got melee so do archers.Warriors have all the best quest 
    mages have non the orb of black fire is a crapy quest. </b> </p>
    <p><b>GoD_FiNiXX&gt; Arrows travel faster then lvl 4 magik and take amost same dmg 
    maybe even more some times they do critical do some thing about this. Will 
    some thing gonna be done about thievery?i had alot of things stolen plz do 
    some thing about it.Will hoary mattys coime </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; First question. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I thought that warriors were too weak compared to other 
    classes.... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Also, we have stuff up our sleeves for magic. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; As we said before, there are more spells in development.
    </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Nei won't let us get away with NOT putting in cool new 
    magic. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Done. </p>
    <p><b>treymule&gt; at higher skill levels Mages get more powerful spells, yet as 
    melee increases, we get no new attacks, no higher damages.. When can I 
    expect to see a 'level 5 sword swing'? that can deal as much damage as a 
    level 5 war spell? BTW &quot;Amusary&quot; got skipped. </b> </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; hey, davej, aren't you working on this? :) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; (Amusary didn't ask anything. he was in the hopper for a 
    while.) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; We have the tech for this; it's just art and content. 
    DaveJ can tell ya more. </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; We've been looking at cool stuff like new animations and 
    new stuff in the melee UI (an accuracy meter is tempting, yes), but there 
    are other things that are higher priority at the moment. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; (BTW all, GoD_FiNiXX and treymule'll be duking it out in 
    the parking lot later tonight; come by and check it out :) </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Making melee more varied is a special and dear issue to 
    me, but I can't make promises or give you a timetable. </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; But if you DO get it, you know who to give props to. 
    Just kidding... </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Done </p>
    <p><b>oPerrin&gt; First I would like to make a couple comments (don't answer as my 
    q): 1. Shadow invasions are very cool but it is insanely frustrating that I 
    am not given the option of HELPING the shadows in any way. </b> </p>
    <p><b>oPerrin&gt; I have pledged my soul to the great lord and now I have to fight 
    his children? Absurd. </b> </p>
    <p>sean@Turbine&gt; Props will go to the animator of course.. Ahem! </p>
    <p><b>oPerrin&gt; 2. If you actually think two 999 diff doors can keep anyone out 
    of the nexus your silly :) </b> </p>
    <p><b>oPerrin&gt; Question: What is your stance on Verant banning the sale of 
    items/characters from EQ? Will we ever see this kind of tyrany from 
    Turbine/MS? </b> </p>
    <p><b>oPerrin&gt; PS. +MrQuarez, please message RitualFait, 3rd in queue now, he 
    is about to be booted. </b> </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; (hmm... &quot;tyranny&quot;... methinks someone has an answer in 
    mind already... :) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; We're not really in the tyranny business. And neither is 
    989. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; These are REAL tough issues, and sometimes it's tempting 
    to use as much force as you can to deal with difficult problems. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; Oh yeah, it's Verant. (eek) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; I'm glad they changed their mind. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; So Tyranny is pretty low-priority on our schedule right 
    now. :) </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; BTW, you can always go to Darktide and backstab people 
    fighting the shadows... And there are other things protecting the Nexus. Heh.
    </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; It's behind housing on the top 10. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; (done) </p>
    <p><b>smurph64&gt; as any thought gone into allowing us to change our characters 
    for a penalty like dropping levels i like many have a good char but with the 
    changes to the dynamics of the game have been weakened dramatically and 
    don't want to start from scratch </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I assume you mean changing skills.... </p>
    <p><b>smurph64&gt; yes changing skills </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Yes, thought has gone into it. There are major gameplay 
    concerns associated with it. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; We generally prefer to try to balance things so that 
    everything is worthwhile .... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (And yes, we're still working on the balance :p) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; I have a comment on this... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (I'm done ... waiting for Foster's comment) </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; The issue is the systems weren't designed for 
    reversibility in the first place. While we can make the change, technically, 
    the effect on game balance could be horrendous and hard to forecast. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; It also leads to &quot;character-of-the-week&quot; problems, where 
    players end up looking too similar to each other because everyone keeps 
    reorging their character to what's popular at that point in the game. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; And as balance changes, I'll be people will want to go back 
    to how they were. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; (done) </p>
    <p><b>Zoltard&gt; While you look at the classes, i hope you consider that archer 
    need their strength for ammo so they have less armor and must return to 
    reload often... i mean i just hope you consider that! :) (don't answer)well... 
    my question now! (more like a suggestion) </b> </p>
    <p><b>Zoltard&gt; What about letting people write messages in the taverns, and 
    those messages should last for a few days so people would have time to read 
    them! that would be very handy for allegiances! as most members aren't 
    online at the same time! so, what do you think? </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; The bulletin boards.... </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Actually, some of you may remember the old broken bulletin 
    boards. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; That's a good idea ... and it ties into some other stuff I'm 
    thinking of... though the number of possible abuses tells me it won't be a 
    trivial task. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (And I'm an archer, so I know about STR) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (ugh) </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (done) </p>
    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; RitualFait will be our last question of the evening...
    </p>
    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; First off a suggestion to keep the muleing problems down: 
    Alow us to purchas a unpickable chest to dump ofdf at our favorit hunting 
    spot with a undroppable key to unlock it this will end the problems with 
    people grabbing your stuff while you mule </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Is that the question? </p>
    <p>RitualFait&gt; no </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; OK. </p>
    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; a suggestion </b> </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (?) </p>
    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; arg cant get it to past </b> </p>
    <p>Crowley@turbine&gt; Rei can sympathize. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I could get it to paste, but it was hard to read what I'd 
    pasted. </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Locked chest is a possibility, but it's not nearly as easy 
    as it sounds. </p>
    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; are the 112 yumies gone me and my patron have been looking 
    for 2-3 monts now and it seems there are noine left we hunt at all the spots 
    or are they just dormant for the comming of a new toy fir us archers </b> </p>
    <p>nei@turbine&gt; they still exist. </p>

    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; you only one </b> </p>

    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; Doh! </p>
    <p><b>RitualFait&gt; what you plan on for us </b> </p>

    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I'll give a hint: &quot;Ewww&quot; </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; I'm happy with my own patron, thank you. </p>
    <p>cfoster@Turbine&gt; I think we're at the end of our chat, folks. </p>
    <p>Dave@turbine&gt; thanks everyone for coming! </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (the &quot;eww&quot; was for the bow question, not swearing allegiance 
    to Dave) </p>

    <p>+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; I would like to thank everyone for coming out this 
    evening and setting a new Zone record for a chat... 918... Thank You! We 
    hope to see you back here next month! </p>

    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; (I bet they think I was joking about the &quot;ewww&quot; :-( </p>
    <p>rei@Turbine&gt; If I keep typing about the bow, will the exit rate continue
