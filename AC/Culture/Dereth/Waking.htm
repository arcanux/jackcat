    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Winter’s touch arrived gently, ushering the 
    Festival season to a close. As I moved through the world, watching it march 
    toward its icy slumber, chill air gave birth to flakes of snow that landed 
    on the earth to form a frosty blanket. The world grew darker as the winter 
    months encroached and the sunsets came earlier. I felt the darkness closing 
    in around me like grievers ready to feast.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Word came down from above that the High 
    Queen had awakened. When she did, she was changed, eager to bring about a 
    new era for the citizens of Dereth. She learned everything that had happened 
    in her two-month absence, and began investigations into the myriad of 
    activities that haunted the Festival season. I was interested in helping, 
    but wondered what my part would be. There were also other rumors that I 
    picked up along the way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Disappearances were becoming commonplace. 
    People—families, friends, adventurers—were heading out to all corners of 
    Dereth, never to be heard from again. Some said that the heart of Marae 
    Lassel held the key to these kidnappings, while others said that Oolutanga 
    was growing too low on sacrifices. Whichever the case, the High Queen set 
    about seeing the matter resolved. She was offering rewards, and they 
    attracted people like a ball of gunk attracts flies. I was one of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The winter winds whipped up another sad 
    tale. The ground trembled and shook the icy mantle of winter side to side, 
    like a shallows shark chewing on a fabled scroll, and the news reached me as 
    I warmed my frozen bones over a cup of hot cocoa in Lytelthorpe. The Olthoi 
    were leaving, but not fast enough. The Ancient Queen was hurt, not dead.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This caused a handful of nervous types to 
    call the High Queen to investigate. Apparently, she did. Near the strongest 
    quakes, she dispatched a guard to stand watch and offer more gifts to those 
    brave enough to delve into the deep places. I offered my services without 
    thought. I wasn’t in it for the reward—I just wanted to see what was down 
    there. At the lowest point, there was little light left. The world became so 
    dark, it was like the abyss continued endlessly and consumed everything, 
    kind of like Ulgrim downing swill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;High Queen Elysa also marked the festival by 
    setting people like myself—smart, intelligent, intuitive and devilishly 
    handsome—on a trail to find her would-be killer. As if the call of the 
    Valley of Death and its newest residents wasn’t enough, I was being offered 
    a chance at fortune and fame.</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">Life was 
    looking up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;First things first. I needed to go to the 
    south mountains, find a village and save the festival spirit from being 
    turned into a puddle of lost dreams. The winter snow may have driven the 
    scarecrows away, but the snowmen were grinning at me from every corner on 
    every road. It was going to be long winter, and it had only just begun.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lytelthorpe was a bustle of activity. In the 
    past week, Selflora had counted five separate expeditions of Guards passing 
    through the town. It was a good sign. It meant that Elysa was alive and 
    well, and if the way the guards were talking was any indication of things to 
    come, she had remembered what it was like at the start.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Selflora served ale, stout, cider and 
    whatever else the customers wanted. It was the festival season and many 
    people were trying to put the past behind them. She remarked on their 
    attire, shared anecdotes, listened to their stories and laughed at their 
    jokes. She felt invigorated by the presence of Elysa's guards. She offered 
    to assist in directing people to Xavier's encampment outside of town, and 
    brought warm cider to those who had moved into the keep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The past year was filled with so much 
    darkness, so many bad memories for those who had been here before the 
    lifestones. So many didn't understand how terrifying it was to have been 
    there, in the beginning, before they had towns and settlements, before Elysa 
    and Thorsten and Asheron. Now, in the chill winter air, it felt like Dereth 
    was waking up from the hold of darkness that had gripped it for years. 
    Selflora smiled brighter than ever.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth had weathered the dark tide. Tumult 
    had turned again to peace.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Ongoing Saga</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As festival season continues, the crafters 
    and collectors of Dereth are hard at work producing new trinkets and masks. 
    While new dangers are found in the Direlands, most of Dereth begins to 
    breathe easily once more after the long struggle against the Olthoi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now we look forward, at some of the changes 
    happening in this month's event.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Explorer Society Quests</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Dereth Exploration Society has made some 
    changes! They have not only changed the rewards that they give, but also 
    when those rewards are given. They're also clearer as to which reward you'll 
    get for any given stamped letter. Check with an agent in one of the nine 
    Nexus towns to find out the details.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Pouches, Backpacks and Sacks</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All player-carryable containers now have 24 
    pack slots, just like backpacks. We made this change so that the &quot;smaller&quot; 
    containers, such as sacks and belt pouches, would be more useful. This does 
    not increase the amount of equipment that players can carry—8 sacks are the 
    same as 8 backpacks—but it does allow for more options in organizing your 
    inventory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Marketplace</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to the means by which distance from other 
    players is calculated, it was possible to gain fellowship XP while your 
    fellowship was in a dungeon and you were standing in the Marketplace. To 
    prevent this behavior, we have changed the location of the Marketplace in 
    the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We intend to fix the code that allows 
    fellowship XP to be shared between players who are not in the same dungeon. 
    For now, though, the Marketplace move is a short-term fix for the location 
    in which this behavior happened most frequently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you were in the Marketplace when you 
    logged off prior to the December event, you should find yourself at your 
    Lifestone when you log back in. You'll see the message, &quot;The currents of 
    portal space cannot return you from whence you came.&nbsp; Your previous location 
    forbids login.&quot; A quick @marketplace and you'll be right back at your 
    trading post!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Avoiding Stamina Loss</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the April 2002 event, &quot;Betrayal,&quot; the 
    Endurance attribute was given new functionality. If you had Melee Defense 
    trained, you would have a chance to avoid losing any stamina when you 
    successfully evaded a melee attack. The same was true for Missile Defense 
    with missile attacks. This chance increased as your base Endurance 
    increased.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We recently discovered a small bug in this 
    system—it was possible to avoid losing stamina even if you did not have the 
    proper Defense skill trained. This bug has been fixed in the December event.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Crafter Stamping</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a number of quest items that, when 
    created, are stamped with the name of their creator. These include 
    Nuhmudira's Gorgets, the Imbued Simulacra Helm and Shield, and the Focusing 
    Stone, among many, many others. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously, the description of the finished 
    item included the phrase, &quot;Created by&quot; and then the name of the creator. 
    This character name controlled whether or not a character could activate the 
    magical enchantments of that item—the creator (or a character with the same 
    name as the creator, if the creator had been deleted) could activate the 
    magic, but no other characters could. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting with this event, items that use a 
    crafter name in this way to restrict activation now say so explicitly. 
    Instead of &quot;Created by Ibn&quot;, for instance, my Focusing Stone reads, &quot;This 
    item can only be activated by Ibn.&quot; In addition, the check for whether or 
    not a character can activate the item now depends on the character's unique 
    ID number, not just on the character's name. This means that you can no 
    longer craft your Elari with one character, delete him, make a new character 
    with the same name, and activate the Elari with your new character. These 
    changes affect all pre-existing items as well as newly created items.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Incidentally, it is important to note that we 
    did not make this change just to prevent the behavior described above. 
    Rather, we are working on long-term plans for some exciting new 
    functionality and we need to standardize how character names are used.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>@Deaths</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We recently discovered that the @deaths 
    command was working rather inefficiently. Even though your client knew how 
    often a character had died, and displayed this information on the Character 
    Information screen, each use of @deaths required it to contact the server. 
    As there was really no need to have this information in two different 
    places, the @deaths command was removed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ding-Dong!</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a handful of house-hookable items 
    that you might reasonably expect to make noise. Previously these items were 
    silent, but as of this month, some of them may prove quite noisy! Remember, 
    before you use an item on a hook you may need to type @house hooks off. And 
    if you already have these items hooked, they may need to be rehooked.</font></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">--------------</font></span></p>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The following is from the 
    December Rollout Article:<br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    In the April 2002 event, &quot;Betrayal&quot;, the Endurance attribute was given new 
    functionality. If you had Melee Defense trained, you would have a chance to 
    avoid losing any stamina when you successfully evaded a melee attack. The 
    same was true for Missile Defense and missile attacks. This chance increased 
    as your base Endurance increased.<br>
    <br>
    We recently discovered a small bug in this system: it was possible to avoid 
    losing stamina even if you did not have the proper Defense skill trained. 
    This bug has been fixed in the December event.<br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    This description is unfortunately not entirely accurate. The bug affected 
    the stamina check on both evades and evasion failures.<br>
    <br>
    What does this mean? It means that players who do not have the appropriate 
    Defense skill trained may see increased stamina loss both when evading 
    incoming attacks and being successfully struck by incoming attacks.</font></span></p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/dec_lttp.htm">AC Insider</a></span></font></small><p><em><font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to 2003's final Letter to the 
    Players. How quickly the year has gone by! In the last twelve months, we've 
    seen an Olthoi Invasion, a Valley of Death, a full rebalancing of the 
    creatures of Dereth, an assassination attempt, and more changes and updates 
    than I could possibly list in this space.</font></em></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the festival season continues in Dereth, a 
    chill is in the air and autumn is slowly turning into winter. Let's take a 
    look at some of the changes that are coming in the December event!</font></p>
    <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">Melee Defense Imbue</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we initially introduced the Armor Imbues 
    in July, we stated that we would be monitoring the usage and effects of 
    these imbues and tweaking them if we felt it to be necessary. This month, we 
    will slightly increase the effect of the Melee Defense Imbue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the past, the bonuses to Melee Defense 
    granted by an Armor Imbue were applied after any melee defense multiplier 
    granted by your weapon. The formula looked something like this:</font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(buffed melee defense * buffed weapon 
      modifier) + Armor Imbue</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the December event, it will look more 
    like this:</font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(buffed melee defense&nbsp; + Armor Imbue) * 
      buffed weapon modifier</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(Note that these formulas are not exact—other 
    modifiers for stance and motion are also involved.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We feel that this will slightly improve the 
    performance of the imbue. This change is retroactive—it will affect all 
    previously imbued pieces of armor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We will monitor the balance of this change, 
    and continue to monitor the use and balance of Armor Imbues in general. In 
    addition, we are currently considering other changes that would improve the 
    performance of all three Armor Imbues.</font></p>
    <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">Creature Missile Attacks</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Like players, creatures have always had the 
    option to vary the speed and accuracy of their missile attacks.&nbsp; At the 
    fastest attack speed, they would attack at 50% of their buffed skill. At the 
    slowest speed, they would attack at 150%. At high levels, this is a very big 
    range. For example, a Lugian Juggernaut has a missile attack skill around 
    300. Any given Juggernaut could end up attacking with an effective skill of 
    150 to 450!&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This variance has, however, shown several 
    side-effects—it has made Missile Defense feel less useful, as well as making 
    missile-using creatures somewhat difficult to balance. If we balanced them 
    to be able to hit players of the appropriate level, frequently they would 
    either attack too fast and miss too often or attack too slow and hit too 
    often. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As of December's update, creatures will no 
    longer vary the speed and accuracy of their missile attacks. They will 
    attack at a fixed 100% of their skill. We believe that this will make the 
    Missile Defense skill feel more useful, as increasing your skill will always 
    increase your chances of dodging a creature's missile attacks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just to be clear: this change does not impact 
    player-versus-player missile combat at all.</font></p>
    <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">Housing Changes</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting in December, we are making three 
    small changes with regard to housing:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">In the past, only the character who 
      actually owned a house could receive violent pink warning messages at 
      login. Now, all characters on the account will receive the warning message 
      if maintenance has not been paid. As before, however, if the house is a 
      mansion and the monarch does not have sufficient rank to maintain the 
      mansion, then only the monarch himself will see a warning about the rank 
      requirement.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">All characters on an account which owns a 
      house will have access to the house UI panel, where you can see the 
      location of your house and the maintenance status.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" face="Arial">All characters on an account which owns a 
      house will automatically be added to the guest list and storage permission 
      list. It will no longer be necessary to manually give storage permission 
      to additional characters on the house-owning account.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">Weeping Weapons</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also in December, we're introducing two 
    changes to Weeping Weapons. The first—and perhaps most noticeable—change is 
    that Weeping Weapons will no longer be unenchantable. The base spells on the 
    weapons will still override all positive enchantments, but they are now 
    valid targets for debuffing. They will use their wielder's Magic Defense 
    skill to resist negative spells.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition, all Weeping Weapons will be able 
    to be tinkered with Ivory and placed on wall hooks.</font></p>
    <h3><font size="2" face="Arial">The Harbinger Quest</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the reintroduction of the Harbinger 
    quest, players have asked us for the ability to re-enter the dungeons to 
    accompany their friends, even if their own reward timers had not yet 
    expired. December's update will allow this possibility, although there will 
    be some restrictions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, you will still only be able to enter 
    the portal near the emissary you have chosen to aid. Second, this change 
    will only take effect the first time you complete the quest after the 
    December event. If you have completed the quest recently, you will not be 
    able to re-enter the dungeon until your timer expires. After that time, you 
    will be able to enter the dungeon at will. It should be noted that the timer 
    on the quest reward has not been changed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had hoped to allow all to re-enter, 
    regardless of when they had completed the quest, but unfortunately this 
    turned out to be unfeasible. We felt that making the change described above 
    was better than making no change at all.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If your timer for this quest has recently 
    expired, or will be expiring soon, you may want to wait until after the 
    December event to run the quest again. That way, you'll be able to take 
    advantage of the changed portal restrictions.</font></p>
