      Several elementals around and a big core with 1 million health. About 100 
      of WE's finest (well, 20-40 finest) beat it down. Lag was horrible as you 
      can image. After it crumbled Martine spoke to us. Log didn't work for some

      Managed to get a trade mule down into the bottom of the Ice cistern that 
      opened in Qualabar and got a shot of the room, fight, and stats for the 
      Core of the Ice Cistern. Wasn't able to get a shot of the parting blow as 
      that a glacial golem ended my stay there rather abruptly. Though by time I 
      got back Martine was talking to the assembled crowd.<br>

      The Ice Cistern was only open for a brief period of time, until the Core 
      was shattered inside. The core had 1 million and one HP! The lag was 
      totally horrendous too... even with a 1400MHz computer and a GeForce4 on 
      cable I was getting maybe 1 frame per 10-15 seconds towards the end. The 
      WORST part was there was a local message every time -- EVERY TIME --

      Another report:<br>
      Ok, I don't know if you already got tons of mails about this, but here is 
      what I found out. The portal opened in Qalaba'r and was from level 20-40. 
      Inside there were a lot of the Elementals like we have outside, and a New 
      Golem type level 70. The name is on one of the screenshots. I couldn't ID 
      the stats, but I could see level and name, and my 38 sword evaded so it 
      couldn't have been that hard.<br>
      <br>
      In the bottom was a LARGE core ice crystal ... thing (name is on 
      screenshot) with 1000001 HP all stats 1. I hit it for about 30-50 unimped 
      and 100 - 140 when some one landed an imp (which didn't last long) on full 
      power with a sword and 5 - 12 with low power.<br>
      <br>
      It took us a long time to get it killed and once we had it around the 10%, 
      Martine showed up and said something about that the crystal was Gaerlan's 
      mana and that there would be more portals opening soon. I lagged a lot so 
      I missed most of it. And then Martine said till we meet again and left, 
      and that was it.<br>
      <br>
      Oh yea it didn't drop anything and didn't give any xp. And it leveled from 
      743 to 744 at around 50% left HP.<br>

      Martine</b> says, &quot;You have done well. This 
      is our first assault against Gaerlan. I...&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I was wrong. Moreover, I failed in bringing the 
      peace for which I yearned. My desires to lead you, to kill Asheron, the 
      harm I brought to Elysa to all of you, all results of Gaerlan's poison 
      words.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Gaerlan appeared in my holding on Marae Lassel as I 
      set the portals to the island here on Dereth. It was an unintentional 
      breach of a Virindi shield that surrounds the Empyrean in portal space 
      that freed him from his stasis. Upon seeing him I had intended to kill 
      him, but he groveled well.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;He offered me a gift in exchange for his life. My 
      one true desire. My heart's true wish. A way home. The same way home that 
      he now taunts us with. Ispar...&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;I believed him, I sheltered him, and now he has 
      betrayed me. I have read what he has written, his diary, and his reports. 
      They inspired me to visit a larger area of Auberean, looking for evidence 
      of the portal destination from the Olthoi world.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;My time there was brief, for the lands there are 
      covered in blight, fungus, and Olthoi. They cluster together on the land 
      and in cavernous burrows beneath the golden cities of the Yalain. Smaller 
      winged Olthoi fill the sky. The fliers are too small to carry their larger 
      cousins, and look too fragile to embark across the sea, I think they are 
      of no true threat...now.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I made my way to Knorr. The Lyceum where Asheron 
      taught his pupils. I searched for evidence of his magic at the place where 
      the Olthoi invaded this world. It is a trick that I learned, when I closed 
      the portals from Ispar to Dereth. I expected to find that it was Asheron's 
      magic that was left, but I found something else...&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I found traces of Gaerlan's magic at the arrival 
      point. It was Gaerlan...his folly, his miscalculation. He moved the portal 
      from their world, when he tried to trap Asheron there. He did not close 
      it.&quot;<br>
      Martine says, &quot;The Yalaini have held Asheron accountable for this folly 
      and made him a criminal, even though he has saved his race...saved our 
      race. And I meant to kill him...&quot;<br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Martine pauses and looks at the assembled crowd.</font><br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;A little boy, a little prince, came to me. He asked 
      me why I tried to kill his uncle. I could not find an answer to his 
      question. I searched within myself to find one, to tell him that Asheron 
      had caused me all of this pain. But Asheron did not bring this upon me. 
      Alayne sold me to the Mosswarts, and the Virindi.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;It was curiosity, and an explorer's nature, that 
      made me use the portal to Dereth. We all, made the choice to come here, as 
      others do every day on Ispar. The portals call to us, but it is in our 
      nature to seek something different and new.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron lives, and with his assistance we will 
      overcome Gaerlan, bring his fortress down, and right what has been made 
      wrong with Dereth.&quot;<br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Martine's voice takes on a very deep and guttural 
      tone.</font><br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Gaerlan's power is drawn from these crystals that 
      sap the mana from the ley lines beneath Dereth. A barrier surrounds his 
      citadel. This barrier is impenetrable as far as I can discern. I cannot 
      circumvent it by the magical means that I know. We must continue our 
      efforts and destroy these crystals.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron is at work in his Castle, with Elysa. They 
      are divining the locations of these caverns so that you might have access 
      to the crystals. You will be informed when they have found the second, 
      third and fourth. I will be preparing...&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;I intend to bring the citadel down. I have 
      unfinished business with Gaerlan.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Gaerlan will have his reckoning!&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Until next we meet...&quot;</font><p align="left">

      </b>On August 24th, a portal to the Fire Cistern Core (restricted to levels 
      30-60) opened in Stonehold.</font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello,<br>
      I came online and heard that a portal was opened in Stonehold so I quickly 
      tried to run there by taking the azaroth settlement portal in qalabar. I 
      died trying to get there thanks to all those annoying high level 
      elementals now out in the wild but I eventually made it :). The inside of 
      the Fire Cistern dungeon (level 30-60 only) had many fire elementals, 
      magma golems and unstable magma golems. After battling my way up to the 
      top I found the Fire Cistern Core.<br>
      <br>
      There were already more than 30 people attacking it and no one had a clue 
      how to destroy it. The lag was insane... I had to turn down graphics 
      settings to be able to move and attack inside so fighting was pretty 
      difficult. After 2 hours or more of battling and trying to find a way to 
      kill it we took a break and sat outside as more and more people came.<br>
      <br>
      Some people were saying that using magic on the core was healing it or 
      that it was causing elementals to spawn...this was not true. The cistern 
      had a huge regeneration rate of 1000hp every 4 seconds. With 1 million hp 
      it would mean we'd have to do more than 200 damage a second to take it 
      down. None of us had an idea of how to deal that much damage or how to get 
      that many people in there to attack it... The high level elementals and 
      unstable magma golems spawn frequently in the room causing even more lag 
      and difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      As we were losing hope and most people were giving up and saying that it 
      was impossible to do and that turbine made it too hard, I decided to take 
      a look at the other server boards at the vault. MT was mentioning that 
      they found a way to kill it. Apparently since the core was so big, if you 
      used a wall spell it would get hit by the entire wall doing an incredible 
      amount of damage. So after organizing the remaining people we headed back 
      inside. We had all the mages line the sides of the room firing shockwave 
      wall spells at the core as the meeles swung at the core with whatever they 
      had. It slowly lost health and after about 45 minutes the core fell and 
      Martine appeared.<br>

      <br>
      Maggie!<br>
      Long time fan, love the site keep up the fantabulous work! Here is what 
      Martine had to say after we killed the fire cistern crystal today on HG. 
      The portal was level 30-60 restricted and appeared in Stonehold (was a 
      greenglobal beckoning all Dereths brave warriors to battle!) the portal 
      had magma golems and fire elementals inside, and at the back near the 
      crystal spawned all manner of elementals (fire, frost, acid, lightning).<br>
      <br>
      The crystal itself appeared to heal when magic was cast upon it (which was 
      resisted and resulted in a xxxx's spell is resisted and the crystal 
      retaliates! greenlocal msg) after 2 hours of encouraging mages to stop 
      casting spells upon the crystal (some polite some others not so politely! 
      ...Eaheaheah) we managed to began whittling away at this behemoth, another 
      1,000,001 hp Fire Cistern! As before, critical hits resulted in a 
      greenlocal msg of &quot;xxxx's blow knocks a fragment off the crystal.&quot; or some 
      such.<br>
      <br>
      Take care!<br>
      <br>

      <font color="#00FF99">Martine surveys the area.</font><br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;A decisive victory. Gaerlan will not allow us to 
      seize his power passively. There will be more resistance as we edge closer 
      to taking his seat of power. New pitfalls will appear, and we must all be 
      prepared.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;With this second crystal shattered we have drawn 
      much attention to our efforts. He will surely become desperate soon.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron has informed me that he has noticed a 
      horrible disturbance and fluctuation in the flow of mana beneath the 
      fallen city of Yanshi. Elysa has sent a contingent of her Royal Guard 
      around the city and is sending her most learned scholar to assist in the 
      study of what transpires there.&quot;<br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Martine lets out a soft laugh.</font><br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;It is possible that something has gone terribly 
      wrong for Gaerlan already, but the result of this error could have larger 
      implications for the world. Asheron has thus placed the discovery of these 
      chambers upon me. I will inform you when the next has been found and 
      furnish you with a way into the heart of the cistern.&quot;<br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Martine looks as though he will leave for moment, 
      then he examines the gathered populace.</font><br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;In my discussion with Asheron I learned something of 
      importance. The Empyrean that are still trapped in portal space are sealed 
      from him. He cannot see any of them. For the past several years he has 
      struggled to pierce a veil that was put in place by the Virindi.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;When the lifestones were created they did indeed 
      have a dual purpose. They anchored our souls and bodies to this world, 
      circumventing a death that was not natural. They were once the beacons 
      that the Yalaini used to guide their ships. Powerful navigational devices 
      would drive massive stone structures and great ships through the air to 
      these waypoints.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;When Elysa, and the other humans, emerged from the 
      Olthoi caves victorious over the True Queen, Asheron altered the 
      lifestones composition. What Gaerlan told me is true. The lifestones do 
      siphon energy from us, feeding it to the Empyreans in portal space. A 
      lifeline of sorts. Our sacrifice keeps an entire race alive in the whirl 
      of portal space.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron is a man that holds duty, above his own well 
      being. He feels ultimately responsible for bringing us to this strange 
      world and watches over us as best he can. It is also true that he feels as 
      though he must aid his fellows, trapped there in the world between worlds. 
      But we, have become his primary concern. Though one day he still hopes to 
      free his people.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron thought I held a key to freeing them, he 
      thought that I had been beyond that wall deep within portal space. It was 
      luck though and nothing more. My connection to the singularity through my 
      symbiotic virindi was limited and dissipated quickly as I drove it out and 
      fell into madness.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;This news was a blow to him.&quot;<br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Martine shakes his head gently.<br>
      </font><b>Martine </b>says, &quot;So much wasted time focusing my rage on him. 
      So many wasted hours trying to find a way to destroy him, when in truth he 
      only wanted to help me, help all of us.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;The penitent man is humbled in the midst of a 
      greater presence, not indignant.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I have much to atone for.&quot;</font></span><p align="left">

      It is as though a great force welled up from somewhere below the city and 
      burned its way to surface before exploding out with a force comparable, if 
      not greater than, the one that destroyed Arwic.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Antius Blackmoor says, &quot;Aside from a rising temperature there are no 
      oddities here that are noteworthy. We've been busy night and day studying 
      the devastation that was levied here. This crater is nearly as large as 
      the one left when Arwic was destroyed, but...the force that destroyed 
      Yanshi seems untainted. Whatever Asheron senses here must be powerful 
      though.&quot;<br>

      Acid Cistern Core (restricted to levels 
      50-80) opened in Ayan Baqur.</font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">A report from Morningthaw:<br>
      I led a group of MT'ers on killing the acid core, here is the gist of the 
      story: <br>
      <br>
      First you must have the dungeon reset, make sure no one is in there for at 
      least 15 minutes, then it's safe to go in. Second, you must have a vulner 
      -- only 1. I was doing allright with a 333 critter and 338 life. They must 
      cast yield, imperil, fester, Slash/Blduge/Perice Vulns and all the attr 
      debuffs.<br>
      <br>
      After that is done, all the millions of melees should start attacking 
      there core. NO WAR SPELLS; they just don't work. After a short while, the 
      core will level from 102ish to 999 and be impossible to land a spell on.<br>
      <br>
      Melees should kill until it is dead, and mages should try and re-imperil<br>
      <br>
      After the core dies, a huge glow appears where the crystal died and 
      Martine comes.</font></span><p align="left">

      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Elysa told me that her scholar has reported on the 
      situation in Yanshi. Something is growing there, within the temple that 
      Gaerlan used to sacrifice his fallen generals. Odd magical fluctuations 
      and elemental storms have been seen sprouting up in the area of the great 
      stone there.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron is still concerned that the flow of mana has 
      not righted itself even though we have destroyed these active crystals. 
      His concern is that the mana flows have been redirected once more, to an 
      area even deeper beneath Dereth than he thought possible.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;He has not stated it openly, but I believe he feels 
      that if this continues, it will hollow the land to a point where it can no 
      longer support its own weight. Crumbling upon itself like a hollow void.&quot;<br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;We must act quickly. There is no time to waste. My 
      summons will come as quickly as I can discern the location of the final

      </b>On September 14th, a portal to the LIghtning Cistern Core (restricted to levels 
      20-40) opened in Dryreach.</font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">A report from WE:<br>
      When the first portal to the Lightning Cistern opened in Dryreach, I 
      quickly hustled to the town. When I got there, I was surprised to see it 
      was restricted 20-40. I also have a level 23 mage, so I nabbed him and got 
      him to there then. By that time people had arrived and were readying 
      themselves to take out the Core. <br>
      <br>
      At first there weren't enough meleers and weren't doing very much damage. 
      But eventually we organized ourselves and took out the core. When we did 
      that, a worldwide message broadcasted: &quot;a portal has opened in Dryreach.&quot;
      <br>
      <br>
      A new cistern had opened to a similar lightning core. The level 
      restriction here was 30-60. I got my main and took him in. This time we 
      took out the core out extremely fast. When we did this another port opened 
      to another one.<br>
      <br>
      The restriction was 50-80 (I think). After getting some buffs, I went into 
      the final cistern. The lag up until now hadn't been too bad, but this time 
      I didn't know what in the world I was doing. Eventually I shut down AC and 
      when I came back people had defeated the core and Martine had come and 
      gone.<br>
      <br>
      I ran outside and got word that yet another cistern had appeared in 
      Dryreach. Level 80+ PK only people were allowed in! This is where I 
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      Also some lore related to this: Martine mentioned (after the mid level 
      core was defeated) that a new Element was being made that thinks and feels 
      and knows what it is like to live... Something big is coming!<br>

      We killed the one on Wintersebb surprisingly fast... we got an imp and 
      vulns on it early, and I was hitting for 300 and I critted once for 774. 
      Afterwards, Martine appeared and said:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I am, Sir Candeth Martine.&quot;<br>
      <b><br>
      Martine </b>says, &quot;Your blood, your sacrifice and your efforts have not 
      gone unnoticed. It is time now that we make our final assault on Gaerlan. 
      Once the base of this crystal is destroyed, I shall ascend to his citadel 
      and destroy the navigation devices. This will cause the citadel to fall to 
      ground, and then we shall take the fight into his home.&quot;<br>
      <b><br>
      Martine</b> says, &quot;But before this, you must know that Asheron and Elysa 
      have discovered the source of the continued entropy of the ley lines. In 
      the place where Gaerlan combined the elemental lords a new elemental is 
      growing. One with complete sentience.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;It understands what it does, and means to live its 
      life. We will need to prepare for battle against this creature as well, 
      lest we defeat Gaerlan only to fall to another foe.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;Asheron remains resolute in his study of the entity 
      and will afford us with details when he can.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Martine </b>says, &quot;When the time is right I will alert you all of my 
      attack. I wish you to witness my atonement. I will summon portals in my 
      Retreat, the base of this crystal and the capital cities.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Martine</b> says, &quot;I will make amends for my transgressions.&quot;<br>

      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting off I'd like to 
      say this is the coolest site ever! During the big event on Sept 14, the 
      lightning cisterns showed up in HG by Dryreach like the other worlds. And 
      Martine showed up each time after we killed the first 3. Then the PK level 
      restricted 80+ portal showed up and we thought no big deal, our high level 
      PK's can handle this. But our PKs had a different opinion about that. A 
      whole allegiance of them decided to go PK and defend the crystal. Well we 
      said ok, no big deal, they just want a PK war, and we'll get a group 
      together and kill them and then go for the crystal. </font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">They defended the crystal 
      so well that it still has Not been killed today. They re-set the dungeon 
      so all the elementals haven't spawned and they sat up on top of the 
      crystal waiting and set 10-15 people around the entrance way so when you 
      portal in, you can't run out the exit. A lot more people would have joined 
      in if it wasn't for the small problem of getting looted, so most didn't 
      even go PK. They held off the attacking fellow all night and all morning.
      </font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">This directly reminds me of 
      TD in defending the soul crystal that held Bael'Zharon. They got 
      recognized for their acts to try and stop it. But this time its a little 
      different; the good guys are losing and Gaerlan is winning. Well I'm off 
      to fight some more. I hope your feeling better from being sick. Ty for all 
      your hard work on the website. </font></span><p align="left">
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">P.S. Will HG get a good or 
      bad rep for this PK war? I guess only time will tell. </font></span><p align="left">

      I'd just like to update you of what's going on on HG with the 4th core. 
      The Praetorian Order PKs have decided to defend the core and I would also 
      like to say that I participated in the 3rd core (50-80). The lag was 
      insane. I had to reboot twice and after the second reboot the core was 
      gone and Martine had just arrived.<br>

      have done.&quot;<br>

      The sounds of powerful magic tear through valleys, and threaten to shake 
      buildings to their foundations. As the sounds subside the voices return.<br>
      <br>
      Gaerlan says, &quot;There is no magic you can call upon that I cannot match. 
      There is nothing in this world that you know, that I have not already 
      stolen from your mind. You were a clever tool, nothing more. We are your 
      greater in every way. Why rise against what you cannot hope to stand 
      against.&quot;<br>

      Martine says, &quot;I am not going to let you eradicate our people. We have 
      fought too long and struggled to survive here.&quot;<br>

      A thunderous clash of magical energies is unleashed across the skyline

      Another series of world broadcasts went out late tonight on Solclaim. It

      guy.<br>
      <br>
      It looks like we've got a new enemy now, too! Apparently he's made use of

      <font color="#00FF99">At Gaerlan's citadel a violent explosion brightens 
      the sky for a moment. Flames erupt from the western side of the citadel as 
      Martine tears through more of Gaerlan's forces.<br>
      <br>
      Martine says, &quot;Nothing can hinder me now Gaerlan. I have routed two of 
      your commanders thus far, and then I shall destroy you.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Gaerlan says, &quot;I have watched you Martine. You have sloughed your true 
      form away, returning to what you once were. Why? Tell me Martine...have 
      you seen the portal that I have created for you? I have given you the way 
      home.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Martine says, &quot;No! Asheron told me that it cannot be done, the research 
      was destroyed.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      WorldBroadcast Gaerlan says, &quot;Destroyed? He never found his way there 
      again, and then there were his greater failures to attend to. But even he 
      forgot the other, the one who went native and lived there. Not all minds 
      are so strong.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      A maniacal laughter fills the air. Martine's voice cracks and a scream of 
      rage explodes into a sound of metal scraping on metal.<br>
      <br>
      WorldBroadcast Gaerlan says, &quot;The Old Man is a fool, and will be as dead 
      as you shall be, should you continue this foolish crusade.&quot;</font></font><font color="#00FF99"><br>

      <br>
      Acid rains from the citadel as Martine reaches the base of the tower.<br>
      Gaerlan says, &quot;At last. Well then vermin, let us see what you have brought 
      me.&quot;<br>
      Martine says, &quot;I have brought you the end, Gaerlan. I have brought you

      Gaerlan laughs. &quot;You have once again forsaken your human form. A pity. I 
      should have liked crushing you as I will the lifestones that defend your 
      precious race. You have come to exact your vengeance...come then rodent, 
      let me weigh you and give you the death you crave.&quot;<br>
      The battle rises through the tower, as the combatants unleash arcane power 
      that threatens to sunder the world. The world trembles. The wizards ascend 
      to the pinnacle of the citadel's tower.</font></span><p align="left">

      This is what happened 10 minutes before the servers went down for the 
      patch. As I was fighting the first one or two lines already had left the 
      scroll area. I ran to the floating citadel. It was still in the air 
      (despite the broadcasted text), but the portal to Ispar was gone.<br>

      have lost...Isparian.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Martine says, &quot;I have yet to lose Gaerlan.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Gaerlan shouts above the hum and the rush of wind, ?You are no more!?<br>
      <br>
      A twist of elemental energy is released from Gaerlan's hands as he leaps 
      from the top of his tower, the elemental energy surrounds Martine.<br>
      <br>
      As Martine unleashes the magic within him the sky flashes purple. The 
      elemental prison about him holds the blast within for a long moment, and 
      the world falls silent.<br>
      <br>
      Gaerlan says, &quot;Insignificant. Martine is no more, run to your hovels, run 
      to Asheron! Though not even he can protect you!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The clouds above the citadel clear. The portal that once beckoned at the 
      zenith of the tower is no more. The citadel begins to shake, and grows 
      unstable. It falls toward the earth slowly at first, and then accelerates.<br>
      <br>
      Gaerlan howls with rage as he realizes what has transpired and what is 
      happening.<br>
      <br>
      Asheron bellows, &quot;Yes Gaerlan. I am very much alive, you have no Throne to 
      protect you now. The time for reckoning is at hand.&quot;<br>
