      <p><span class="Head"><b>Dereth: Coldeve PY 13 / Earth: February 2002 </b>
      </span><br>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">After months of simply responding to events, 
      Isparian adventurers were anxious for a chance to take the fight to the 
      “enemy,” whether that was Martine or some other force. While their enemy 
      remained unseen, Coldeve did give them a chance to make their mark on the 
      world. And Coldeve yielded clues to some of the land's oldest mysteries.
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Surprising rumors quickly spread throughout 
    Isparian lands of a new Tumerok town being established in the north of 
    Osteth. Even more surprising was the rumor that Celdiseth the Archmage had 
    taken one of the Tumeroks as an apprentice. Adventurers who followed these 
    rumors and made the long journey to the northern wilds were quickly welcomed 
    into the fledgling town by Aun Aulakhe, son of Aun Shimauri, and his friend 
    Aun Tikakhe. Initially, Aulakhe directed all visitors to Tikakhe, who warmly 
    received them. Tikakhe instructed them on how to craft a buadren, a magical 
    Tumerok drum. Those who gathered the necessary components and, with 
    Tikakhe's aid, crafted them into a buadren soon found that this exercise was 
    a test of their worth, after which Aun Aulakhe took them into his 
    confidence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He began by telling them the tale of the 
    great Aun Tumerok warrior, Aun Tanua. Many years before, Tanua had left 
    Timaru in the hope of bringing the Hea Tumeroks back to the way of pure 
    Tumeroks. He never returned from this journey, and many had given him up for 
    dead. Aun Shimauri, however, sent his mind along the pathways of the 
    Lightning-Sea (the Tumerok name for portal space) and felt a glimmer of 
    Tanua's keh, or spirit. Apparently the Virindi had taken Tanua captive at 
    the request of their loyal Hea Tumerok minions. Aun Aulakhe's father sent 
    him out into the world to find a way to free Tanua. Now Aulakhe, after 
    discovering a way to summon a portal to the place where Tanua was held, 
    asked the Isparians to aid him in this quest. </font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Disturbing and horrific sights greeted those who 
    entered the portal. Among these sights were Virindi creatures called 
    Clusters, creatures of immense power. As they progressed, the adventurers 
    found Lilitha, the long-lost hero and explorer. The manic ravings of her 
    disturbed mind revealed that she had been captured by the Virindi years 
    before and had been the subject of their twisted experiments. After 
    exhausting all hope of freeing her, the adventurers progressed deeper and 
    came across an even more amazing and unsettling discovery. Deep in the 
    hidden recesses of the Virindi facility, they found two imprisoned Empyreans 
    who shared visions of their lives before capture. Again, no way was found to 
    release these captives, and the heroes continued on in their search for Aun 
    Tanua. Eventually, their diligence was rewarded and Tanua was found, but his 
    mind was in the same deranged state as the other captives they had 
    encountered. They searched the area surrounding him, but with the same 
    results as all the others: there was no way to release him. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">However, before they had entered the portal he 
    had summoned, Aun Aulakhe had given the adventurers an ember from the new 
    town's fire. A tribal fire is a critical element of Tumerok life. They hold 
    the belief that their council fires link the spirits of the people, past and 
    present, no matter their location. With this small fragment of the fire, the 
    adventurers were able to strengthen Tanua's mind momentarily. Before he 
    slipped back into his deranged state, Tanua infused his spirit into the 
    ember. Escaping with their lives, the adventurers gave Aulakhe this ember, 
    and with this in hand, Aulakhe was able to join Tanua's spirit with the keh 
    of his people. Although his physical form remained trapped, Tanua's spirit 
    was now free to be among his people once more. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In another surprising turn of events, 
      mages, traveling to the various magical Essences, discovered new portals 
      leading to ancient Empyrean constructions. The Arcanum quickly 
      commissioned explorers to map out these facilities and promised Writs of 
      Refugee as rewards for any item brought back. Those brave enough to take 
      on this challenge quickly found that these facilities were overrun with 
      Olthoi, and--to the shock of many--elemental creatures of all varieties, 
      including the never-before-seen elementals of Acid and Ice. Alongside 
      these elementals were powerful Golems, including Pyreal Golems, which 
      mages soon learned to dread. The few that returned reported untold numbers 
      of traps designed to keep them out. </font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">They also brought back prisms of pure elemental 
    force. Unsure of what to make of these prisms, the Arcanum returned them to 
    those that had found them. Through trial and error, the owners of these 
    prisms found that they could be combined in such a way as to create powerful 
    helms that granted the wearer unsurpassed resistance and agility. However, 
    the question of who was behind these facilities, and what their purpose was, 
    remained unanswered. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Along with these revelations and discoveries, 
    Coldeve marked the return of two greatly sought-after items. Ever since 
    Hoary Mattekars had been hunted to extinction, Isparians had been searching 
    for something to match the qualities of the Hoary Mattekar robe. (Britana of 
    Greenspire had come close with her work on Canscent Mattekar pelts, but this 
    still wasn't a perfect copy of the original.) For some reason, Hoary 
    Mattekars began appearing throughout Dereth during the month of Coldeve, to 
    the rejoicing of many. While some wondered why these supposedly extinct 
    creatures had reappeared in the land, most were more interested in how to 
    find them. As if this joyous turn of events were not enough, the abilities 
    of the Shadow Hunter armor smiths returned thanks to magics cast by 
    Nuhmudira. The smiths were once more able to craft armor of outstanding 
    quality and resilience. The return of these items, and successes in other 
    parts of Dereth, gave many renewed hope that they would be able to face the 
    challenges ahead.<br>
