      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>Dereth: Morningthaw
      PY 11 / Earth: April 2000</b></span><br>
      In Morningthaw, darkness and blood flooded the land in equal measure.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The month began inauspiciously enough. The
      pent-up tension of the previous month, the sense of threat, like a
      towering wave about to break, hovered still over the heads of all. The
      clouds still raced, the moons still loomed, and the figure of the Demon
      still appeared during storms . . . yet no Shadow activity broke the
      oppressive quiet. The biggest news was the murder of the Banderling thief
      known as Gertarh.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the desert, Hamud ibn Rafik fought a
      personal battle with the forces of Darkness, and it did not go well with
      him. “We no longer fear our mortality,” he wrote his daughter Devana,
      “but there exist worse things than death.” Having given his loyalty to
      the forces of Bael'Zharon, he found himself less and less able to resist
      their commands. He told Devana of a portal in the South Direlands leading
      to a facility called the Nexus. He seemed to think that some key to
      defeating the Shadows could be found in that place. Unfortunately, those
      attempting to investigate the complex found the way blocked by strong
      doors. Some attempted to slip through by exploiting unpredictable forms of
      teleportation magic.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the pause, explorers rediscovered
      the legendary Silifi of Crimson Stars -- an artifact many despaired of
      ever finding. The weapon had been lost after the death of the One Queen,
      when the warrior Wari al Sha'im had wandered into the A'mun Desert in
      search of new challenges. Apparently he met a violent end, for his weapon
      was broken into many pieces, none of which were easily found. It seemed
      that the blade had been utterly shattered. Only careful exploration of the
      desert lands allowed the bold to reconstruct the Silifi. Kayna bint Iswas,
      a recluse Walim scholar learned in the lore of the Silifi, was
      instrumental in forging this Isparian relic anew.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the Shadows launched their invasion.
      The first wave, lead by a Shadow Captain, hit Fort Tethana and the
      Direlands. After a sharp battle, the defenders of the Fort repulsed the
      dark warriors, slaying the Captain. Shouts of victory echoed from the
      walls, but the euphoria was short-lived. The Shadows advanced across the
      northern land bridge into Osteth, encamping themselves at Plateau. They
      were defeated there as well, and moved further east, into the Mount Esper
      area. Their last Captain moved to Stonehold to lead her forces, but was
      anticipated. A large force met her there, and she was cut down.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the remnants of the Captains' forces
      could be found in the forests and on the slopes of Esper, the Shadow
      armies seemed to have gone underground once more. The illusion of peace
      was shattered a week later, as their armies poured into the Direlands once
      more, under the leadership of the dread general Black Ferah.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She first assaulted the religious retreat
      at Wei Jhou. The defenders were hard pressed, but once Ferah appeared to
      lead the attack personally, she was quickly surrounded and cut down.
      Again, the defenders rejoiced, but Ferah, as she fell, hissed, “A fine
      attempt, but this is but my shadow. I shall move on!” So she did,
      advancing across the southern land bridge into the Linvak Mountains. Ferah
      was perhaps too bold in stating her intentions, and was met in the hamlet
      of Kara by strong forces. She and her Lieutenant were smote down within
      seconds of appearing. Again, the Isparians rejoiced. After this easy
      victory, some of the more powerful defenders thought the battle no longer
      worth their time, and left the field.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This proved a mistake, as the general moved
      her command post into one of the howling Shadow Spires. The portals
      leading to this blasphemous construct appeared randomly on the landscape.
      Not a few adventurers wandered into these gateways, and were slain by
      Ferah and her bodyguard. In the end, the Isparians assembled at the
      portals to launch a cohesive assault on the Spire. Ferah again found
      herself overwhelmed. She fell, coldly stating, “A fine attempt . . . I
      see I must reformulate my plans.” Again, the Isparians celebrated a
      victory, and again it was but a temporary respite.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eight days after the climactic fight in the
      Spire, Ler Rhan's forces flooded the wastes of the A'mun desert. Unlike
      Ferah, he elected to establish his headquarters in the Spires at the
      outset. However, the portals to the Spires proved unresponsive to powerful
      adventurers. Younger warriors, mages, and archers made sorties into the
      Spire and were beaten back by this fearsome apparition. Eventually,
      however, he was overcome, and moved on to the plains in the Aluvian-settled
      regions of Dereth. Again, he was tracked and defeated. Once more he moved,
      into the Spire found in the festering Blackmire Swamp. Once more he fell,
      and Black Ferah reappeared in the Direlands to give his troops time to
      regroup.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To assist her, she brought to life the
      spires that loomed close to the towns of Osteth. The Shadows of the Spires
      -- Shadow Children, for the most part -- were fought by the newest
      arrivals to Dereth, as the portals leading to their lairs refused to
      activate for the mighty. The town Spires, however, did field two new
      horrors: Shadow Sprites and Spire Shadows. Sprites appeared to be Zefir
      that had been absorbed by the darkness. Spire Shadows, possibly the most
      disgusting of Bael'Zharon's followers, appeared to have grown out of the
      floor of the Spires. The implications were troubling -- it now appeared
      that the Spires were bizarre, living fusions of multiple creatures,
      twisted and bent to the will of the Hopeslayer.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each of the Shadow Spires, however, carried
      a secret treasure: a piece of a key. When these were combined in the
      proper fashion, the doors to the Nexus were opened. Massive parties
      flooded the facility. Legions of powerful Undead and Shadows resisted
      their advance, but the sheer numbers told on defenders. At the bottom of
      the Nexus hovered a floating crystal, similar to the Great Work of Frore.
      It was quickly swarmed by the vengeful Isparians, and fell. Tayway of
      Thistledown, Freeze of Frostfell, Al Neo of Morningthaw, Qua Badib of
      Leafcull, Hell Maker of Harvestgain, and Lop of Darktide made the killing
      blows, and were rewarded with chunks of the Crystal. At the fall of the
      Nexus, the Shadow-armies melted away into the Darkness, leaving behind
      only an echo of unsettling, strangely satisfied, laughter.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many questions were left unanswered. Where
      was the third general, Isin Dule, and why had he not participated in the
      assault? What was the purpose of the invasion, and why, if the Shadows
      have limitless armies, did so few participate? What was the Nexus Crystal,
      why were the Shadows protecting it, and why did they melt away upon its
      destruction? Most importantly, what was to come? The generals, it seems,
      were pushed back, but not defeated, with what consequences for Bael'Zharon,
      no one knows.</font>

      A hush fell upon the land. The sun, so recently dimmed to a wan, bloody
      red, flared bright yellow once more. Of the Shadows, there was no sign,
      and their intentions remained inscrutable.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jaleh al-Thani sought an answer to the
      mystery in the depths of the Direlands, the only area where Shadows were
      known to remain in numbers. Leading a caravan of like-minded Sho and
      Gharu'ndim, the noble settled near the Darktide Festival Stone, and
      established the town of Ayan Baqur. Rather quickly, a group of Aluvians
      arrived, driven by the overcrowding in Arwic. Among this group was Ulgrim
      the Unpleasant, a discredited scholar. While Ulgrim's stout-fueled rants
      entertained many, few believed a word he spoke.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ayan Baqur's most unique resident, however,
      was “Claude,” a Virindi who floated into town one afternoon with a
      wave and a hollow-voiced, “Greetings. Might a simple human archmage
      dispense his wares from within your defenseless hovel?” Claude was given
      a tent a safe distance from his “fellow humans.” Whether the residents
      accepted him primarily out of fear, curiosity, or amusement remains open
      to debate.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile, in the north, Lady Tallial
      acquired a seneschal to oversee her long-neglected tasks at Neydisa
      Castle. The Lady had been in a deep depression since the death of Sir
      Joffre Tremblant in Frore. Hence, her decision to take on the
      untrustworthy Gormling may be forgiven. Like Ulgrim, the seneschal could
      neither hold nor forgo his drink. Worse, he was discovered to be an agent
      of her rival, the bandit MacDougal. Tallial, who spent her days staring
      wretchedly at mementos Tremblant had left her, seemed oblivious to her
      peril.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Harking to the abandoned arts of Ispar,
      weaponsmiths recreated Viamont's piercing rapier weapons, sneeringly
      referred to as “the big stick-pins” by Aluvian highlanders. Many were
      promptly stolen by Drudges seeking shiny objects, and eventually passed on
      to more powerful monsters. Other new weapons were discovered by
      adventurers afield: a cursed dagger and electrical throwing daggers
      belonging to the elusive assassin Oswald. Again, the crafty rogue managed
      to evade his pursuers.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, in the fastness of his mountain
      stronghold, the assassin Hamud ibn Rafik continued to fight his lonely war
      against the dominion of the Shadows. When some Tenebrous Edge initiates
      came to see him, they discovered he had been transformed into a Shadow
      himself, with barely any ability to speak. “I am unable to leave my
      chambers in this ancient, cursed fortress,” he had written his daughter.
      “I know now what will become of me. The Dark Master himself spoke to me
      and told me what lies in store . . . What awaits me now surpasses even the
      depraved rites of the Milantans.” Alone and tormented, the entity that
      had been Hamud stoically awaited his fate.</font>
