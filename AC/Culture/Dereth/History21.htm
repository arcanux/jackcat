    <span class="Head"><b>Wintersebb PY 13/ Earth: March 2002 </b></span><br>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth seems consumed by secrets. Where are the 
    Empyreans? What is the secret behind the Lifestones? Why are the Virindi 
    interested in Dereth? Who, or what, is the force empowering the forces of 
    Shadow? With each day Isparians are in Dereth, they come closer to 
    uncovering the secrets behind these and many other questions. In the case of 
    some secrets, however, once they are found out, many would prefer to have 
    remained ignorant. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">After Nuhmudira's disappearance, people began to 
    search her mansion for some clue to her whereabouts. Although slightly more 
    ornate than the mansions owned by monarchs throughout the land, it seemed 
    innocuous enough at first. Soon however, the searchers uncovered a hidden 
    chamber below her mansion where the most shocking and horrific rituals had 
    been carried out. On a sacrificial altar stained a deep russet brown, they 
    found the body of a Gharu'ndim man, and nestled away in a corner, urns 
    filled with blood. The horror of this revelation was compounded by the 
    discovery of Nuhmudira's journal nearby. In this journal, she detailed some 
    of her acts and her reasons for committing them. In the last entry, she 
    concluded by saying, “Take shelter in the reach of my hand, humans. I am the 
    Savior of Dereth.” This and other portions of the journal caused many to 
    wonder whether some dark force had taken control of her mind or she had 
    taken leave of her senses. Queen Elysa in particular was stunned by this, as 
    Nuhmudira had been a leading member of the Queen's Council. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The mystery behind the Empyrean structures 
      found near the magical essences seemed closer to being answered when 
      adventurers in the Direlands encountered facilities reportedly created by 
      Martine. Within these facilities they found twisted creatures. One 
      facility contained Olthoi infused with the magically inert Chorizite, and 
      another contained elementals expressing two opposing elements, such as 
      elementals of Fire and Ice or Acid and Lightning. Tying these two 
      facilities together was a third facility, one in which both forms of 
      creature could be found under the direction of an enhanced Dranith Menacet. 
      Dranith looked like a Hollow Minion, but possessed a sentience not seen in 
      other minions of this type. Isparian adventurers had been encountered this 
      creature before, but unlike his previous incarnations, this Dranith was 
      almost completely invulnerable. He easily vanquished any who tried to 
      attack him, sending them spiraling back to Lifestone before many of them 
      knew what happened. Dranith seemed pleased that he was not disappointing 
      his “father,” Martine, and boasted of this to those he defeated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However not all secrets uncovered were of 
    such a dire nature. Alchemists who had been slaving over methods of 
    improving their craft discovered Bloodhunter potions. These potions greatly 
    increased the power of arrows and quarrels, and improved atlatl darts seemed 
    soon to come. Although the nature of these arrows prevented all but 
    accomplished archers from using them, the promise of using such powerful 
    weapons motivated many to hone their skills. At the same time, weapons of 
    heretofore unknown power were found in the land, though again, only the most 
    skilled of warriors could use them. These new weapons, along with the spells 
    found during Snowreap and the Coldeve return of items long gone from the 
    land, renewed the confidence of warriors in their abilities, come what may.

    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">I</span>f not for one event 
    during the month of Wintersebb, the Bronze Statues gifted to the various 
    towns would likely go unmentioned. The Arcanum had given these statues to 
    the Isparians in recognition of their accomplishments on Dereth. Usually the 
    statues would cast beneficial statues on those nearby, welcomed by some and 
    cursed by others as annoyances. One morning, however, the residents of some 
    towns found their statues casting harmful spells which reduced the 
    recipients' abilities and skills. Some towns found their statues missing, 
    while in other towns two statues appeared, one still casting helpful spells, 
    the other casting injurious ones. Fortunately, the harmful statues 
    disappeared the following day, but many questions remained unanswered. Was 
    this simply a flaw in the Arcanum's enchantments, or was there something 
    more sinister behind this event? Only time would tell. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth seems consumed by secrets. As soon 
      as one is exposed, two more take its place. What will happen when all 
      these secrets are revealed? That, like the secrets themselves, has yet to 
      be uncovered.<br>
