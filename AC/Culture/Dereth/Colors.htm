    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">About the room a host of Lugians and Tumeroks 
    exchanged wary glances. Their leaders had debated for four hours. Each had 
    highlighted the goals of their campaign, their alliance with the Virindi, 
    and their contempt for those that claimed regency over them. Their words had 
    been laced with vitriol and at points it seemed the two sides would engage 
    in open conflict. Eventually, the tensions drew the meeting to a standstill 
    that had now lasted a full two minutes. The Lugian and Tumerok banners were 
    still in the windless hall. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Then the silence was broken.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A union, then.&quot; Muldaveus' voice was as deep 
    as his face was stoic. The Tumerok seated across the table offered his hand.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Agreed. A union.&quot; The two shook and rose to 
    their feet. &quot;We have been beneath the heels of others too long. Now, when 
    the slave masters are occupied we shall claim this world for our own.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The assembled raised their voices as one. The 
    banners fell and the forces of the renegade Lugians and the Dereth Tumeroks 
    became an army.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The stranger placed the crate behind Rah bint 
    Khurdig. He took the trade notes from her hand and offered a wry smile.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Throw them with care.&quot; The stranger said as 
    he left her tent.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What is that?&quot; Sherelle asked as her fellow 
    Tolmic lifted a crystal from the fallen shard. It boasted a rich blue color 
    and looked lustrous in the fading sunlight. Tolmic held it up and examined 
    it closely.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Don't know.&quot; His eyes widened as he moved 
    the newfound gem near his breastplate. &quot;That's odd.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It feels like it belongs in the 
    breastplate.&quot; He looked down at the Celdon crafted by Alean only a moon 
    before. &quot;Should I try it?&quot; He looked at Sherelle.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What's the worst that could happen?&quot;</font></p>

    the drinking horn, jug of mead…&quot; Ulgrim sang the tune lightly as he walked 
    through the front door. A broad smile spread across his face. &quot;Home.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Home. Nearly six hundred years before he had 
    left this place after a pitched and violent battle where many had fallen 
    beneath the scythe-pincers of the Olthoi. He ran his hands along the 
    stonework of the courtyard and looked up at the massive diamond behemoth 
    that stood at the gates.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Greetings Lord Master Asheron,&quot; it said. 
    Asheron managed a grim smile, and the golem bowed. &quot;Welcome home.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Overlord.&quot; The Tumerok stopped in his tracks 
    and offered a salute to the Overlord. The Overlord responded with a simple 
    nod of his head.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The raiders are honoring the terms of the 
    alliance,&quot; the Tumerok reported. &quot;They have begun moving toward current 
    Lugian holdings, though it appears that they remain fractured and hampered 
    by those still loyal to Kresovus.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What of our forces?&quot; the Overlord asked as 
    he thrust a dagger through a tender chunk of fire auroch meat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Our forces rally to the banners outside of 
    Dryreach. The holdings there swell with more of our number by the moment; 
    the eldest are joining the ranks of the militia while the youngest remain in 
    the training facilities honing their skills.&quot; The Tumerok remained rigid and 
    alert, never once meeting the eyes of his commander.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Keep me informed of any movement against us, 
    Captain.&quot; The Overlord ripped a hunk of meat free and dismissed the captain 
    with a wave. The captain turned on his heels and left the Overlord's 
    chambers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Dryreach?&quot; Elysa asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes. Not truly much of a surprise; the 
    residents of the town did say that there was an increase in the Tumerok 
    population over the past lunar cycle,&quot; Antius responded. He sat across the 
    table from her, flanked by two guards.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;See that a garrison is sent to investigate. 
    I'll be damned if I'll allow Hea Tumeroks to make their homes in Derethian 
    lands again.&quot; She met Antius' gaze and motioned the two guards away. As they 
    left the room, she asked, &quot;What of Asheron?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Gone.&quot; He leaned back in the chair and let 
    out a soft sigh. &quot;I made my way to his island as you instructed, but there 
    was no answer when I reached the tower.&quot; He paused as he searched her 
    consternated face, then asked, &quot;Should I continue my efforts?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No—&quot; she snapped. &quot;No, I was just curious 
    for my friend. He's been troubled lately. Besides, it's time we stopped 
    relying on him and rely on ourselves.&quot;</font></p>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month, as part of our ongoing efforts 
      to further improve server performance, we increased the cache size of the 
      allegiance pass-up experience cache. This caused some odd behavior to 
      appear with vassal experience pass-up. This month, we have tweaked the 
      cache size downward a bit to reduce the appearance of odd behavior, while 
      still preserving the benefits to server performance. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Missile objects that hit the environment 
      will now be destroyed, just as if they had successfully struck their 
      target. This change should improve the performance both of the server and 
      the client, especially in crowded situations. </font></li>

    edition of the <em>Asheron's Call</em> Letter to the Players. The <em>AC 
    Live</em> team was hoping that spring would be here by the time of this 
    writing, but alas, there is still snow on the ground. This month's Letter 
    may look a little thin; there aren't too many items we want to discuss, and 
    the majority of the April update involves new content and quests that we'd 
    like you to discover for yourselves. But there are a few issues that bear 
    mentioning.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Rebalancing, Feedback, and the 
    Missile Range Penalty</strong><br>
    The monster rebalancing has resulted in a lot of player discussion, both 
    positive and negative, and we want to thank everyone for all the feedback we 
    have received. The <em>AC Live</em> team prides itself on its relationship 
    with players, and the rebalancing process has really highlighted how 
    important player feedback is to us.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The range penalty to missile attack skills 
    serves as a graphic example of the importance of player feedback. As part of 
    our rebalancing efforts last month, we adjusted the missile defense on a 
    large number of creatures across Dereth. The new missile defense levels 
    worked well at close range, but they highlighted a major flaw of the system 
    that had never before been terribly important: the range penalty. 
    Previously, a missile character at full range was operating at about 50% of 
    their normal attack skill, which made hitting level-appropriate monsters 
    from full range extremely difficult. This kind of percentage penalty is 
    especially difficult to overcome at higher skill levels where 50% of your 
    attack skill may mean 200-300 points of skill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Player feedback made it immediately obvious 
    that the old-style penalty just would not fly in the new, rebalanced Dereth, 
    and so the penalty has been reduced considerably for the April update. 
    Missile characters will still incur a penalty to their attack skill for 
    firing at range, but the new penalty is much reduced: from approximately 20% 
    at the absolute furthest possible range, down to no penalty at all at about 
    half (outdoor) radar range. We will continue to monitor feedback about this 
    change, of course, and may make other adjustments if they become necessary.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The April update will also see another 
    addition of interest to some missile characters: a craftable thrown weapon 
    that can be used with a shield. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Dark Heraldry</strong><br>
    Every month one or two players will ask us what will ever become of the 
    unfinished Tumerok Banner quest. We are overjoyed to be able to answer that 
    question with the April update. Of course, you'll have to discover the exact 
    changes yourself, but suffice to say that the military commanders have 
    finally gotten their rewards in order-and just in time to meet a renewed 
    menace!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Change of the Season</strong><br>
    Dereth remained draped in winter last month-it was so cold here in 
    Massachusetts, we figured Dereth should be too! Actually, the survival of 
    the snow was a small oversight, and with the April update the snow will 
    recede and the spring flowers will finally appear. If only we could 
    manipulate New England's weather so easily…&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, as we warned you at the beginning, there 
    weren't many issues to discuss in this Letter. Life in Dereth forges on…and 
    portents of dark times and hard choices throng about us. But that, of 
    course, you'll discover on your own. Thanks for reading, and thank you for 
    playing <em>Asheron's Call</em>!</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi all,<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Beginning with the April update, we have begun to implement the initial 
    steps of a plan where we will be upgrading some servers to improve the 
    gameplay experience for <em>AC1</em> players. What this means is that we 
    will be moving all the information and resources for the game environments 
    to new hardware that will carry us into the future. Old hardware doesn't 
    improve with age like fine wine, so it's imperative that we make these 
    hardware upgrades as soon as possible so we can guarantee that <em>AC1</em> 
    has a long and prosperous future.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    We were in the process of starting this important process on Wednesday, 
    April 24th, and staged the Solclaim world on new servers. We monitored its 
    performance throughout the day and ran into several issues regarding severe 
    lag. It was then that we made the decision to roll the world back to its 
    original hardware so our Solclaim players could continue to enjoy their <em>
    AC1</em> gameplay experience. It was important to us to identify these 
    problems so we could minimize their impact on future rollouts and upgrades.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would like to personally apologize to 
    everyone for not clearly identifying that we were upgrading these machines 
    and that with any hardware upgrade ran a risk of this sort of problem. You 
    should have been informed of what was going on. So on to the future and the 
    next steps of what we will be doing.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    This weekend, we will be setting up a test environment that will be open to 
    the public, meaning anyone with an active <em>AC1 </em>account can get on 
    the new world and play until their hearts are content. We encourage everyone 
    to do so, so we can get an accurate idea of performance implications of 
    running <em>AC</em> on the new hardware. Remember: this new and improved 
    hardware will be rolled out to all worlds very soon, so it's important for 
    us to find out where the problems lie so we can make the transition as 
    efficiently and smoothly as possible when the time comes.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    That's where you come in. We need your help.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    This public test environment will be open to all users with active <em>AC1</em> 
    accounts, but will mirror Solclaim player database, so there will be an 
    established pool of characters on that world that are not just new 
    characters. It was important to do this so that we could test the world 
    under normal conditions.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    We will be monitoring the progress of the public test server very closely 
    and make our decisions based on what we see over the weekend. If we do not 
    notice any severe performance issues that are detrimental to the gameplay 
    experience, we will complete the transition and introduce the new hardware 
    as the &quot;new and improved&quot; Solclaim on Monday. If we run into similar 
    performance issues like those we witnessed on Wednesday, we will move 
    Solclaim back to the old hardware.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    In either case, we will let you know of our plans and make that information 
    very open and clear, so everyone knows what is going on at all times and 
    what these decisions mean to them.<br>
    <br>
    We are looking forward to upgrading <em>AC1</em> to our new hardware, which 
    we feel will dramatically improve your gameplay experience and provide you 
    enjoyment for years to come.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are some important points&nbsp;to note about 
    playing on Shadowclaim vs. playing on Solclaim:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Playing On Shadowclaim</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shadowclaim is a test world only. It is 
      open to everyone that has an AC1 account. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shadowclaim&nbsp;will go away on Monday, April 
      28th. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have a character from <em>Solclaim</em>, 
      you will be able to play with that character on Shadowclaim. If you do 
      not&nbsp;have a character on Solclaim, you will need to create a new character 
      to play on Shadowclaim. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any and all progress you make on 
      Shadowclaim this weekend will be lost. This includes levels, xp, loot, 
      items, etc. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you play on Shadowclaim, you may get to 
      see some cool stuff happen. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Playing On Solclaim</strong></font></div>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you play on Solclaim all weekend, you 
      will gain experience, levels, loot, items, etc. normally and your progress 
      will be yours to keep. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There will not be any additional benefit 
      to playing on Solclaim. It will purely be status quo, same as it ever was.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When we make the transition of moving 
      Solclaim to the new hardware, all the information from Solclaim will come
