    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“It’s the laughing, you see?” The guard was disheveled. 
    His clothes were torn and bloody, his eyes set deep in their sockets, his 
    skin covered with grit and his hair matted and greasy. He reeked of filth, 
    and smiled to reveal teeth that were stained brown from neglect. He swayed 
    from side to side in constant motion, eyes darting toward the walls of the 
    hall and the shadows cast against them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elysa recognized him still through the grime and 
    stench—Roderick Largent, once a member of her castle guard. He had been 
    assigned to investigate the disappearances on Marae Lassel, went missing two 
    months prior, and was found preaching in Zaikhal only a few hours ago. He 
    stood before her now, flanked by two guards who watched him with wary eyes. 
    She felt pity.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Roderick, where have you been, what did you see?” she 
    asked in a quiet and steady voice, trying to calm him down.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Roderick’s eyes locked onto hers. Now his demeanor 
    changed—he stood tall and stopped shifting. No more laughter, no more smile, 
    only ice-blue eyes staring through her. The room seemed to warp; sound and 
    light bent in awkward directions as he began to speak.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I have seen the end. I have seen the coming of a tide 
    that shall scour the face of this world and wipe clean the prophecies of the 
    golden age. There will be a call to children who were forgotten, buried and 
    lost. Their wrath shall be barbed with poison that courses through the veins 
    of the world, and all shall rot. Auberean is forsaken by the light and so it 
    shall be consumed.” He cackled madly, but his lips did not move; his eyes 
    still held hers in place and the room slowly turned dark. “First, there 
    shall be a time of respite. The shadow will creep through its halls, falling 
    silent but working, ever vigilant, while the warped souls of man are drawn 
    closer to its call. The halls of the frozen city will be strengthened, a 
    place of battle shall cull the weak from the land, Ispar will turn against 
    Ispar. The heavens will break and a scream both holy and unholy will shatter 
    a barrier that has long protected us all.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flames burst up behind Roderick, and his crazed eyes bore 
    through Elysa like knives. The wound in her back throbbed and the sound of 
    blood roared in her ears.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You ask me what I have seen? I have seen the folly of 
    sending the Lightbringer away. Now the darkness shall grow, unchecked, 
    unabated. You are the architect of this world’s demise! Damned is your 
    name!” The laughter began again and Elysa screamed in defiance.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When she woke, Antius placed his hands on her shoulders.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What is it?” he asked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Antius, recall all those investigating the Raven Hand.” 
    She touched her hand to one of his as she tossed the covers aside. “I need 
    reports from all the cities, I need to know of anything strange that has 
    happened there, anything that is…not right.” She pulled herself out of bed 
    and moved towards her armor. “Get anyone that we sent to that damned island 
    back here!”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Antius rubbed his face and ran a hand through his hair, 
    “Elysa, where are you going?” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“The city of ice.” She looked back at the bed, but he was 
    no longer there. Across the room, he shouldered his armor. Elysa smiled, 
    despite herself. “What are you doing?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Coming with you,” he said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No, I need you to get me those reports, and bring our 
    scouts back home.” She strapped on one pauldron, then the other. “I’ll take 
    a group of guards with me. Please, Antius.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Antius nodded with resignation. There was no arguing with 
    her once she had made up her mind. But even his confidence in her could not 
    completely erase the worry.&nbsp; He—and Ispar—had almost lost her once. “Be 
    careful.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She smiled, “Always.”</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Four days without feeding, four days without 
	wash and four days without any sign of his quarry. He drew a hand through 
	his greasy hair and looked at the shreth beneath his boot. Hardly worth 
	killing, true, but at the moment he would settle for a drudge. He spied the 
	note on a corpse nearby, likely some poor sod who had wandered too near the 
	pack of shreth. Kneeling, he caught the scent of crisp cold air. Snow was 
	coming soon. The letter was odd, but it made him think of the witch. He 
	smiled in spite of the aching pain within his soul and headed north.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	&quot;What is it?&quot; Wah Chon asked Ye Te. The two stood outside their shop 
	doorways looking out across the town crossing. Snow fell, obscuring their 
	vision.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I don't know. I don't think that I want to.&quot; There was a long pause. Wah 
	Chon started moving cautiously down the hill. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;What are you doin'?&quot; asked Ye Te.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;I want to know what it is.&quot; Wah Chon snapped, startled and nearly leaping 
	into the air. &quot;Stop yelling, you fool!&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Ye Te shook her head. &quot;Remember the last statues that appeared in town. 
	These could be the same,&quot; she chided her friend. &quot;Best you wear your armor 
	and prepare to fight.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Wah Chon waved a hand at Ye Te to show her displeasure and stepped closer to 
	the small statue. Her face became pale as she turned to her friend. Ye Te 
	took a step towards Wah Chon, who turned and ran, slipping up the hill. Ye 
	Te spied glowing red eyes and black wings through the snow. She grew pale as 
	well as she retreated into her shop and slid the door closed.<br>

	</font><b><font face="Arial">The Ongoing Saga<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	After the eruption of darkness on the island to the southwest, many 
	adventurers assailed the transformed Caul in an attempt to discern its 
	secrets. New horrors were discovered, as were new trophies and rewards. As 
	the reformed Council tries to respond to this new threat, additional dangers 
	seem to be found daily, some much closer to home.<br>
	<br>
	Now let's take a look at some of the changes in this month's event.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><b>Tuskers and Physics<br>
	</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	After the January event, we began seeing a number of unusual server-side lag 
	spikes, generally occurring alongside strange reports of invisible monsters 
	and players who suddenly found themselves in total darkness, unable to move.<br>
	<br>
	Over the course of this month, we have taken several steps to resolve these 
	issues, such as temporarily removing all monsters from the most frequently 
	affected dungeons and restarting the servers with increased logging. <br>
	<br>
	With the February event, we believe we have resolved most if not all of the 
	bugs that caused these situations. We have also added improved logging to 
	help us stamp out any remaining issues.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><b>Speedhack Auto-enforcement<br>
	</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	In August of 2003, we enabled auto-enforcement of speed-altering violations 
	on Darktide, in addition to the auto-detection which had been active for 
	some time. This meant that if you tried to use a speed-altering program like 
	Gear or Speedhack on Darktide, you would get booted on your first three 
	offenses, and banned for additional offenses.<br>
	<br>
	Since that time, we have made some improvements to the auto-detection and 
	auto-enforcement system, and we are now prepared to activate 
	auto-enforcement on the seven NPK worlds. The same rules will be used as on 
	Darktide.</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">On your first, second, and third 
		detection, you will be automatically booted from the game. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">On your fourth detection, you will be 
		booted from the game and given a one-day ban. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">On your fifth detection as well as any 
		further detections, you will be booted from the game and given a 
		three-day ban.<br>
		We will be rolling out auto-enforcement in waves to ensure that there 
		are no unexpected snags. Approximately a week after the February event, 
		Frostfell will be briefly restarted in order to have auto-enforcement 
		activated. The other six worlds will most likely follow in the March 
		event.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><b><font face="Arial">Chat Improvements</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	This month, we've made some improvements and bug fixes to allegiance chat, 
	as well as adding several new commands for general chat.</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">@filter –allegiance no longer filters 
		global allegiance chat. It still filters all @m, @p, @v, and @c 
		messages. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You should no longer see text from 
		characters that you have squelched in allegiance chat. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is now an option in the Character 
		Options panel, &quot;Global Allegiance Chat.&quot; Checking or unchecking this 
		option will enable or disable allegiance chat for your character. You 
		can also toggle this option via the commands @allegiance chat on or 
		@allegiance chat off. Existing characters have this option on by 
		default. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now set allegiance chat as your 
		default chat mode by clicking on the Chat button to the left of the chat 
		bar. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Allegiance chat is now orange instead of 
		pink. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">When you type @r, the chat bar will now 
		autoreplace this with @t &lt;name of the last player who sent you a tell&gt;. 
		Now, if you receive a tell from a second player while you are typing 
		your reply, it will go to the correct recipient. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have added @mr, which will 
		autoreplace with @t &lt;name of the last follower who sent you an @m 
		message&gt;.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have added @pr, which will 
		autoreplace with @t &lt;name of the last vassal who sent you an @p 
		message&gt;. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now map keys to the following 
		commands via the &quot;Configure Keyboard&quot; button in your Options panel: @r, 
		@mr, @pr, and toggle allegiance chat.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><b><font face="Arial">Treasure in February<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	As we mentioned in the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/feb04_lttp.htm">
	Letter to the Players</a>, we are in the process of rebalancing treasure in 
	much the same way that we rebalanced creature difficulty and experience last 
	year. Our goals are twofold: we want treasure to be 1) useful and 2) 
	interesting. <br>
	<br>
	February is only the first stage of our rebalancing, and although some 
	changes you will notice are obvious steps towards our goals, the value of 
	other changes will only become clear as the process continues. In 
	particular, here are some areas in which things are not yet perfect:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spell scrolls: The level of scrolls that 
		you find on creatures is badly out of whack right now. Truthfully, it 
		has been for awhile, but our other changes in February really emphasize 
		this issue. We plan to have spell scrolls of appropriate levels dropping 
		with the March update. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wield Req. Weapons: The distribution of 
		weapons with wield requirements at extreme levels (80+) is not 
		satisfactory. We will be working on this aspect of treasure over the 
		next several months. <br>
		Spells on Items: The distribution of item and creature spells on items 
		at extreme levels (80+) is not satisfactory. We will be working on this 
		aspect of treasure over the next several months. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Chests: February concentrated on 
		creature loot; March will concentrate more heavily on chest loot. So 
		during the February update you may run across some chests that are not 
		yet properly adjusted for the area in which they appear. </font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Armor in general, and Covenant Armor in 
		particular: We have some interesting plans for loot armor, but it is 
		likely going to be many months before you see these plans come to full 
		fruition. <br>
		So keep these factors in mind and remember that we're going to be 
		working on treasure for the next several months. And enjoy the changes!</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">NPCs and Stacks<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	There are many NPCs who will reward you for items that can be stacked. In 
	the past, if you had a stack of these items, you had to split them up into 
	individual items before you could hand them in.<br>
	<br>
	Starting this month, you can now hand a whole stack to any NPC that accepts 
	an item that can be stacked. The NPC should take only one item off the 
	stack, leaving the remainder in your pack, and then give you your reward.<br>
	<br>
	Town Criers will still take whole stacks of items and dispose of them for 
	you.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><b>Fellowship XP and Trophies<br>
	</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=161">
	Last month</a>, we made a change to the way fellowship XP was handled with 
	regards to player location. One aspect of this change that resulted in a 
	great deal of feedback was the increased difficulty in sharing XP from 
	trophies, such as the Olthoi Queen's head or the Olthoi Pincers. If a 
	character in your fellowship happened to be standing outside Behdo Yii's 
	house when you turned in an Olthoi Pincer, for example, he would receive no 
	XP as you were indoors, and he was outdoors. Fellowship XP doesn't share 
	between indoor and outdoor characters anymore.<br>
	<br>
	Starting this month, XP rewards from trophy turn-ins are no longer subject 
	to the fellowship restrictions. Those rewards that are shared among your 
	fellowship will be shared no matter where any individual member of that 
	fellowship is standing. So when you hand in the Queen's head, you won't have 
	to worry about everyone in your fellowship having to crowd into Aun 
	Hareltah's tent in Timaru.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">Secure Trade Window</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	We've seen a number of complaints, both on the forums and in reports to the 
	Admin team, regarding players who close the secure trade window in 
	mid-transaction, in the hopes that their trading partner will accidentally 
	hand them an item or drop an item on the ground.<br>
	<br>
	To prevent this behavior, we have made the following change: if a player 
	closes the trade window, the other player's trade window will not close 
	automatically. Instead, the other player will receive the &quot;The trade has 
	been cancelled&quot; message and the trade window will stay open. The other 
	player can close the window at his or her leisure.</font></p>

    </small>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Welcome to the February 2004 Letter to the Players! You 
    may be a little surprised at how soon after the January event this letter 
    arrived, and I don’t blame you. Several months ago, we decided to move our 
    events to the second week of the month, starting in February. As we needed 
    to delay the January event until the very end of the month, however, this 
    means that there will only be about two weeks between the January event and 
    the February event. </p>
    <p><font size="2">In Dereth, the full power and malice of Ler Rhan—Aerbax’s 
    so-called mirror—has been revealed with the eruption of darkness on the 
    Singularity Caul. While the populace looks fearfully to the southwest, High 
    Queen Elysa Strathelar and the council continue working to improve the lives 
    of all people on Dereth. </p>
    <p>Now let’s take a look at some of the changes coming up in 
    the February event</p>
    <h3><font size="3">Dark Majesty Unlocked For All</font></h3>
    <p>I’ll cut right to the chase: Starting with the February 
    event, all players will have access to Asheron’s Call: Dark Majesty content, 
    whether or not they purchased the expansion pack. That means that all 
    characters will be able to access Marae Lassel, and all characters will have 
    the ability to purchase in-game housing.</p>
    <p>We have decided to do this for a number of reasons. The 
    first reason is...well, because we like to give things to you, our fans, who 
    have stayed with us and made our purchase of the Asheron’s Call franchise 
    possible.&nbsp; Those who don’t have Dark Majesty will now be able to access that 
    content, and adventure with their friends who do currently have the Dark 
    Majesty expansion.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>We are also very aware of the current problems with 
    obtaining new copies of Dark Majesty, and we are doing this to help those 
    who only need it to upgrade existing accounts. We also know that our recent 
    announcement has sparked a lot of interest in previous players who are 
    looking to return to the game—some who may have left before the expansion 
    pack was released—and we want to give them more incentive to return.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, we are working hard to make copies of the 
    game available to new players. We want new players to join just as much as 
    we want former players to return! This is just a quick fix to one part of 
    the issue. As soon as we have a solution to availability in place, we’ll let 
    you know. We’re working on it as you read this!</p>
    <p>Because this update is done via the game servers, and not 
    via the MS Gaming Zone, it will not change your listed subscription, nor 
    will it change which lobbies you use to enter the game. If you currently use 
    the non-Dark Majesty lobbies, continue to do so. You will be able to access 
    Dark Majesty content even when entering the game via these lobbies.</p>
    <h3><font size="3">Allegiance XP Changes</font></h3>
    <p>The February event brings with it sweeping changes to the 
    means by which AC’s allegiance system creates and passes-up experience.</p>
    <p>Please refer back to our
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=157">
    article</a> on these changes. We’ve also posted a
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=162">
    follow-up</a> article with some changes and clarifications.</p>
    <h3><font size="3">Treasure Changes</font></h3>
    <p>February will also see the beginning of a rebalancing of 
    the Asheron’s Call treasure system, similar to the monster rebalancing that 
    was done last year. Some of our goals for the treasure system include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creatures in a particular level range should drop loot 
      that is useful to characters in that level range.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>More creatures should drop items that have been 
      modified in some way by the treasure system. There should always be a 
      reason to check a creature’s corpse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As with the monster rebalancing, this is a process that 
    will take several months. This month, you will see small to moderate changes 
    in the loot dropped by almost every creature, as well as that found in many 
    special chests.</p>
    <h3><font size="3">Darktide Award</font></h3>
    <p>As referenced in this
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=163">
    article</a>, we will be providing all characters on Darktide with an award 
    as an apology for the downtime and rollback a week and a half ago. Starting 
    on the day of the February event, all existing characters on Darktide can 
    talk to a town crier for the following one-time award:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two random pieces of high-level loot.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Enough experience to gain three levels. Characters who 
      are level 126 will receive three times the experience required to go from 
      125 to 126. This XP will not be shared in fellowships and will not be 
      passed up through the allegiance system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This award must be claimed before the March event. Make 
    sure you leave two empty slots in your backpack!</p>
    <h3><font size="3">Quintessence Sickle</font></h3>
    <p>The updated Quintessence Sickle has an activation 
    requirement of 325 Axe. This was originally intended to be a wield 
    requirement, and that oversight has been fixed for the February event.</p>
    <p>If you are wielding a Quintessence Sickle when the worlds 
    come down for the February event, and you do not have a base Axe skill of 
    325, the Sickle will be moved to your backpack when you enter the world 
    after the event. If your backpack is full, it will drop on the ground.
   </p>
    <p>To be safe, we recommend that those players who do not 
    meet the wield requirements not have the Sickle wielded when the worlds come 
    down for the event. </p>
    <h3><font size="3">Content Revisions</font></h3>
    <p>We’re continuing our plans of retouching outdated content. 
    In February, you’ll be seeing the return of one of Dereth’s most elusive 
    citizens, as well as an update to one of its oldest and most legendary 
    quests.</p>
    <h3><font size="3">The Future</font></h3>
    <p>We’re always working on more additions and updates, and we 
    think you’ll be excited about them all. Here are some of the larger tasks we 
    have planned for the next several months:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Additional updates to treasure, such as more mutations 
      for wands and bows, and improved damage-over-time balance.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>A focus on player vs. player gameplay, including 
      general improvements and resolutions to known PvP issues. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Some magic additions, such as fellowship spells and 
      improvements to the buffing process.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>An assortment of quest and town upgrades. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Asheron’s Call’s next story arc!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ll be providing more information on many of these 
    changes, especially PvP, long before they enter the game. We know you’ll 
    have a great deal of feedback for us.</p>
    <p>In addition to all of this, we’ve got some exciting new 
    content lined up for February. See you in Dereth!</p>

    <font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us"><b><a name="envoy"></a>The Envoys and 
    the Code of Conduct</b> - F</span>rom 
    the<span lang="en-us">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=181">Turbine Site</a> </span></font>
    <p><em>From Katahdin, our Customer Support Manager.</em></p>
    <p>There have been many questions regarding how the Code of Conduct will be 
    enforced by Turbine Customer Service. As Customer Service Manager, I’d like 
    to take this opportunity to clarify some of those questions:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>The CoC is not changing right now. As I said in an earlier post, I’d 
      like to enforce the rules as they are written now, to get a feel for 
      whether new rules are needed.&nbsp; Changes could be made to it later this 
      summer; we will see if they are necessary.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Bans will now be across all servers. For example, if you get banned on 
      Thistledown for profanity, we will ban your account on all the other 
      servers for the same length of time as the original.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>From now on, 3 strikes and you are out. 3 bans for any combination of 
      CoC violations will suspend your account for one year. For particularly 
      abusive behavior, we reserve the right to ban you for a year without 3 
      strikes. As we will be keeping a database of the number of bans on 
      accounts, if we discover on review any duration of a ban is actually your 
      third, we will re-ban for the year.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>UCM – The UCM test will be administered in much the same manner that 
      it is today. Why? Because it works. Let me clarify a few points:<br>
&nbsp;<ol type="a">
        <li>When you are the subject of a UCM test, you are put into limbo, 
        where you can neither take any damage, nor give any.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The AC client itself suppresses combat messages from your chat 
        window.&nbsp; We cannot make any accommodation for the ‘spam’ you receive 
        from either fellowship, allegiance chat or any third party plug-ins.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The steps in the UCM test are for a reason, not because we find them 
        entertaining or are trying to embarrass a player. You are asked to do a 
        number of steps because each of them is important. Very few unattended 
        combat macro’s can perform each step of the UCM test; some can only do a 
        few, some can do more, but none of them can do all of them. Your failure 
        to repeat the string of characters or the short sentence within the time 
        allowed (30 seconds) constitutes a fail of the test. If you pop in at 34 
        seconds or, for that matter, 1 minute and some spare seconds, it does 
        not change the fact that the time allowed was exceeded.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If you refuse the UCM test, or fail any section, you will be banned.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If you log out during a UCM test, you will be banned.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>UCM will be enforced on all servers. No exceptions.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Mages – if you are vulning for another player, your character is 
        subject to UCM tests too.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Duration of bans:<br>
&nbsp;<ol type="i">
          <li>First offense – 3 days all servers </li>
          <li>Second offense – 7 days all servers </li>
          <li>Third offense – 1 year, all servers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I know the above reads harshly, but UCMs are a top problem; they hog 
        areas and deprive characters playing legitimately of a level playing 
        field.&nbsp; You can count on the fact that we’re going to be doing a lot of 
        UCM checks.&nbsp; If we happen to pick you in error for a UCM, please bear 
        with us; we’re trying to make the game better for us all.</li>
        <li>Profanity – Profanity, hate speech and vulgarity are violations of 
        the CoC. Using this type of language in open chat is a violation and we 
        take these reports seriously. If you are getting /tells which contain 
        objectionable language and an Envoy asks you to squelch the player, 
        please do so. We are <i><u>not</u></i> trying to ignore your request; we 
        are trying to force the chat into the open. Yes, we can get logs of all 
        chat in the game; however, it takes time. We would rather deal with the 
        situation at that moment and could use the assistance of person who 
        reports the problem. Please don’t argue with the Envoy over this; we 
        need your assistance to clean it up. Allegiances and Fellowship who 
        report profanity or hate speech on their channels will be asked to expel 
        the player from the allegiance or fellowship. These are voluntary 
        relationships and if you object to it, then you have the right to leave 
        or to petition your monarch to clean up your ranks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Racist remarks and hate speech will not be tolerated. If an Envoy 
        observes this behavior, no warning is required. You <i><u>will</u></i> 
        be banned.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Appeals. You can appeal bans. You cannot appeal bans on any of the 
        forums, through in-game support or through any employee’s email at 
        Turbine. You must use a link that will be found on the Asheron’s Call 
        home page and provide the appropriate information.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Offensive names – We are looking into this and as soon as I have 
        more information about how we will proceed, I’ll let you know. For now, 
        characters that are under level 20 will be asked to delete the 
        character. If you refuse, you will be banned across all servers and it 
        will count as a strike. Characters over level 20 may be asked to 
        voluntarily rename the character. If you refuse, we have the option of 
        renaming it for you or simply deleting it.<br>
        <br>
        That said: Please don’t panic. If you are over level 20, I want to work 
        with you, because some players have been allowed to have offensive names 
        for years through lack of enforcement. However, some of the names simply 
        have to go, so we’ll work with you to pick an appropriate name.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That’s it for now; I think I hit all the big ticket items. In closing, 
      I want to say that we are thrilled to be bringing player support home to 
      Turbine. We love the game, too, and want it to be a great time with a 
      level playing field for all players.<font size="2" face="arial"><em><br>
