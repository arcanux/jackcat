    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, so far today I tried the quest 3 different times. Basically this is 
    what I could gather from it. The quest is in 3 stages, which are listed 
    below. When gathering a group, a successful team will have at the ABSOLUTE 
    VERY LEAST 10 people in each of the 4 groups (levels 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 
    and 80+). Most likely you will want 20 or more in each group, though the 
    strength of numbers can complicate communication. Make sure you have a quest 
    leader assigned and that everyone knows who he or she is. Also make sure 
    each group has their own leader who will communicate with the quest leader, 
    and who can communicate with each of the fellowships in their group. 
    Coordination and communication are the keys to success. Try your absolute 
    best to keep non-essential chatter to an absolute minimum, as it's hard to 
    filter through a whole lot of spam.<br>
    <br>
    Preparing for the journey:<br>
    - Mule ALL your valuable, droppable items (except death items). You most 
    likely will die in here, no matter HOW uber you think you are.<br>
    - Bring lots of stamina and health elixirs, but don't bother with debuff 
    gems. You'll just be wasting them here, as the moment you remove all your 
    debuffs, you'll get debuffed again 5 times over.<br>
    - Bring PPGSx or NeoGSx... no droppable armour. You will most likely not be 
    able to recover your body if you die.<br>
    - Get as MANY PEOPLE as you possibly can for each level group. Many, many 
    people will die, but the more you have, the better the chance that SOMEONE 
    will get thru to open the doors for other groups to progress. If one group 
    is wiped out, the whole quest goes belly up.<br>
    <br>
    STAGE 1:<br>
    The portal is at the Aun Tumerok Settlement at 82.7N, 21.1E (fastest way 
    there is to use a Celdiseth's portal gem).You are able to go into the portal 
    ONLY IF you have crafted a Buadren (though there are other ways in... see 
    the cheat below). The entryway consists of a bunch of portals that you jump 
    down to (and stand on, surprisingly enough). The first jump down is the 
    level 80+ portal, the 2nd is the 70-79, the 3rd down is the 60-69, and the 
    4th down is the 50-59 portal. When you enter the appropriate portal, you are 
    teleported to the bottom of the room to a corner with all the others in your 
    level group. Each corner has a door and a lever: the level 50-59 side has a 
    lever that opens the door for the level 60-69 side, and all the way up to 
    the 80+ side that opens the door on the 50-59 side.</small></font><p align="center">

    (This part is written from the perspective of the level 60-69 team, as my 
    main is level 69; directions may vary for other groups.) Upon the opening of 
    their door, the group should run down the ramp and stay left... they'll pass 
    through a room and into a hallway, and if they stay left, they will run into 
    an INVISIBLE portal that takes them to a common room where the other 3 level 
    groups wind up. Do NOT kill the Virindi Energy Clusters (VECs) and Quiddity 
    Rifts on the way, it's not worth the trouble! At this point, you're in a 
    relatively safe room with a red energy door that you can close so everyone 
    can buff.<br>
    <br>
    STAGE 2:<br>
    When you open this red door and run out, you'll be facing more VECs and 
    Quiddity Rifts... most people choose to fight them, but this breaks down the 
    organization and throws the quest into chaos. If you want to, you can find a 
    ramp up to the 2nd floor of this area where you can see Lilitha in her cage 
    floating above the fray (but don't get near the blue crystals, which will 
    cast Ring Spells at you). In this area (on the ground floor) are 4 different 
    level restricted portals, where the groups will go in... this actually takes 
    them back to the same hallway area where the invisible portal was, except 
    lower (into a spot that's usually safe, as long as everyone stays put and 
    doesn't move). At this point, they should coordinate their efforts, because 
    the rest of this part is a nightmare! The level 80+ group goes first... they 
    should run to the bottom of the hallways into a big room at the bottom, 
    trying to stay alive and not fighting anything, until they reach the bottom 
    room with a door and a lever. This leveropens the door in the room at the 
    bottom of the 50-59 group's area. The 80+ group has to stay alive long 
    enough to let the 50s go down and throw the lever in their room... the 50s 
    lever opens the door for the 60s, who have to go down and open the door for 
    the 70s, who open the door for the 80s. Each group can go thru the open door 
    into the portal once they've opened the lever for the next group (though 
    this part is unconfirmed).</small></font><p align="center">

    ALTERNATE STAGE 2:<br>
    Instead of taking the invisible portal to Lilitha's area, you can just run 
    madly down the hallways (staying mostly right) and you will wind up in the 
    big room at the bottom with the 2nd lever and 2nd door. This might be 
    easier, as you bypass the Lilitha room and the chaos that always ensues in 
    there. The important thing is that groups should NOT go until the previous 
    group has opened the door for them, as the bottom room is chock full of the 
    absolute worst critters in the game (level 190 VECs and Quiddity Rifts) and 
    you just can NOT camp it unless you have at least 40-50 people in your level 
    group.</small></font><p align="center">

    STAGE 3: -- Unknown --<br>
    Now the mystery is, what is beyond the doors? Do the groups meet up again to 
    do the last part as a big team? I don't yet know, and don't know of anyone 
    who does. The reward for this quest is still a mystery, and I can say with 
    near certainty that there's no way in hell that it could be worth all the 
    trouble.<br>
    <br>
    The reason this quest is so difficult and that formerly-uber characters keep 
    dying by the dozens is that 1) the VECs are immune to war magic and 
    drains... mages have to vuln them and let melees kill them. 2) Melees can't 
    kill the VECs unless they're debuffed by the mages, as their natural armour 
    and melee defense is very, very high. 3) The Quiddity Rifts are different 
    from their Singularity Caul counterparts... they're level 180 instead of 
    200, and do an &quot;undefined&quot; kind of damage that you can't protect against: 
    when they hit, it just says &quot;Quiddity Rifts hits your chest for 20 points of 
    damage!&quot; (with 2 spaces between the &quot;of&quot; and the &quot;damage&quot; where a damage 
    type would normally go -- a bug?). And since the dungeon is designed for you 
    NOT to fight (insane respawn rate, tough critters that take a long time to 
    kill, and always having a full spectrum of level VI debuffs), a lot of time 
    is spent running around like headless chickens.<br>
    <br>
    CHEAT:<br>
    Apparently there's a way to tie to a Lilitha Room portal... this can only be 
    done by someone who has no tie. I'm sketchy on the details, as I wasn't the 
    one to do this. However, if a character can get a tie to this portal and 
    summon for people waiting outside, each character can tie to this portal and 
    recall to Stage 2 whenever they want! These characters don't even need the 
    Buadren, as only the top portal has the Buadren flag! The only caveat here 
    is that the characters without Buadrens may not be able to participate in 
    whatever reward is at the end of this quest (of course no one knows what it 
    is yet!) But at least you'll be able to pull in members of your allegiance 
    and friends who don't have the Buadren yet to die at your side :-)<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps!<br>

    a long time.&quot; <br>
    Lilitha tells you, &quot;Person. The box meant person.&quot; <br>
    Lilitha tells you, &quot;They took the box outside in a cloud. It's nothing but 
    purple. You could fall forever, and everything was bent this way and that. 
    But in some places there were blue ribbons that crackled and danced.&quot; <br>
    Lilitha tells you, &quot;There were things around the ribbons. They looked like 
    glowing water and trailed strings of jelly. They turned as the box went by 
    and poked each other with the jelly-strings. They were the size of houses. 
    Maybe. Size doesn't work right outside.&quot; <br>
    Lilitha tells you, &quot;Temenua. That one caught the box as it slept. It brought 
    the box to a child, and the child gave it to these things.&quot; <br>

    Lilitha tells you, &quot;They took the box apart twice. First they looked for 
    what was inside the box, but they said it was empty. Then they wanted to 
    know what made the box go.&quot; <br>
    Lilitha tells you, &quot;They did it with blue lights. They drew lines on the box

    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Your vision swims. For a moment, 
    you seem to be sitting before an orb wreathed in sourceless, clean blue 
    flame. Across from you sits a young man, his hands knotted in anguish, his 
    golden eyes flaring with anger. He speaks, the words flowing like the 
    musical speech of the sea peoples of Ispar. Like an afterimage, the words 
    come again a moment later, in your own tongue. &quot;Someone has to do something. 
    They say we may only watch. But the things we see! You cannot believe what 
    she subjects these people to. This mad queen should be cast down!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    You hear words, as if from your own mouth, saying, &quot;But what can you do?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I can do what's right. I'm going back with the next study group,&quot; he says, 
    looking at you carefully. &quot;Maybe. for good.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How could you stay without being found as something. other?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    The man laughs, a bitter thing. &quot;The same way we take our smug notes. We 
    don't hide away in hunting blinds, you know. The life masters create flesh 
    glamors for us. I've strolled through the markets, smelling the crops.&quot; He 
    rubs his head, chin ducking with some faint embarrassment. &quot;Being that short 
    takes some getting used to.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. A wall of arid heat slams into your face, nearly knocking 
    you back. You blink, eyes dry and stinging.<br>
    <br>
    You stand over a raw lava flow. The craggy walls are black stone, scarcely 
    lit by the damask shadows from the liquid earth that rolls and flops beneath 
    you. Down in the flow, figures are moving; constellations of stone, burning 
    white from their inhospitable wading pool.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you stand upon a crest, a frigid wind 
    blowing icy knives through you, the land dropping away from your toes. You 
    stumble back a step back from the precipice, dazzled by the light that 
    skitters and skips across the snowy ground. Squinting, you raise a hand 
    against the light of the dying sun to see.<br>
    <br>
    Mount Esper. But not as you know it. Heat haze causes the sun to dance a jig 
    as the cinder cone's lake boils white. On all sides, people and golems move 
    about. A floating stone pallet is loaded with bars of greenish gold metal; a 
    white-hot golem illuminates the entry shaft it trundles out of, the the echo 
    filling the crater with the sound of a mountain falling down.<br>
    <br>
    You turn to your left. An distinguished elderly woman looks to the west, the 
    clean white light of the sun sharpening the crags of her cheeks. One hand 
    rests on a platinum cane inscribed with fine, elegant calligraphy. 
    Impossibly, you know her friend Ejan made it for her. And impossibly, you 
    find yourself speaking words you cannot guess the meanings of; and you seem 
    to hear it in Roulean. &quot;Shaura... All these things... the great books, the 
    monuments... The Cathedral that stood for eight millenia. What will happen 
    to our works? They'll fall to dust if we're away so long.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Time will come when these things will be again,&quot; the old woman smiles, her 
    silver hair glinting in the waning sun. &quot;Don't worry, my dear. When all has 
    fallen down, you and I will be there to rebuild it, won't we?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Her storm-grey eyes turn away to the west again, like ship sailing over sea. 
    Distantly, she murmurs, &quot;He's a good boy, Resanne. I believe in him. Unlike 
    that daft Emperor who has us make him coins as the olthoi approach.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you see a group of men and women in white 
    and purple. Somehow, you recognize the pattern of the robes; the colors of 
    the Knorr Lyceum. The fabric is torn, sweat-stained, the anonymous faces 
    floating above them white with fatigue. You are jostled and shoved into a 
    group. You blink into the shadows. What.? The adepts raise their hands. 
    Their eyes fill with radiance, growing blinding, growing until you can see 
    the shadow of their skulls. <br>
    <br>
    You fall into the silvered tube of portalspace. It snakes and writhes, 
    following safe courses through dimensions no eye can see, and magic can 
    scarcely chart. And then...<br>
    <br>
    The tunnel does not collapse as it always does. It peels open. You are 
    weightless, formless, tumbling through an empty violet abyss. So tired. 
    Sleep.<br>

    And something, somewhere, tears a little more.<br>

    moment, your vision dims. Great wooden doors, intricately carved and glowing 
    faintly green, creak open before you. Before you is a long, wide hall, its 
    cloistered ceilings lit by false stars that mime the constellations of the 
    sky outside. Niches along both sides are lined with candles. No. not 
    candles, but simple silver rods, tarnish blackening the hollows of their 
    fine reliefs. Over the apex of each rod floats a waterdrop of arcane light, 
    rippling as it spins in place. The light colors alternate, azure and violet, 
    casting shadows as faint as wind.<br>
    <br>
    Musical, incomprehensible speech calls your attention to the end of the 
    great hall. A figure stands there, backlit by a roiling white inferno as 
    blinding as the sun. A long shadow, unleavened by the waterlight from the 
    silver rods, paints the marble at your feet. Like an echo, the meaning of 
    the words comes back at you.<br>

    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to be on the deck of a ship. A 
    ship? There are no. Over the rail you can see docks carved from alabaster 
    and chalcedony. Where? A crowd that roars. Shrill. The clouds recoil over 
    the glittering spires of the city, and black rain descends on buzzing alien 
    wings. The deck lurches - you find yourself clutching the wall of the 
    dungeon.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to stand in creaking jungle. You 
    are running, swinging a sword wreathed in astral flames. A hundred men 
    around you roar as one. There! At last, the ornate blue spires rise before 
    you. Ridiculous lizard-men flap towards you, their eyes glowing. Women 
    dressed in the skins of animals raise their hands, and the ground erupts. 
    You swim forward, wading through a rain of earth and a razor wind of flying 
    thorns. The noise of falling water becomes deafening.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem to be staggering up a flight of 
    stairs. A fetor rises from the room below, the stink of the slaughterhouse. 
    They never made a sound. None of them, not even once, not even when the 
    blades began to hew. Men follow you up, slapping each other on the back, 
    laughing too much as they adjust their campaign cloaks. The air is no 
    cleaner above, though. Here the smell is of burning. You sidestep a fall of 
    blue marble. A drunken warrior shouts apologies from the loft above, a 
    purloined silver icon clutched in his stained fist.<br>
    <br>
    Your vision swims. For a moment, you seem be running down stairs. Men lining 
    the walls grin at you, bowing as you pass. They smell of sweat and blood, 
    their white, star-branded campaign cloaks stained a lurid incarnadine. Their 
    nostrils are flaring. Lips pull back from grey and brown teeth. You hold the 
    torch above your head.<br>
    <br>
    The women huddle together in the center of the blue stone room, watching the 
    men with cool, detached defiance. Is that how it is? We'll see how long that 
    detachment lasts. You nod to the men. One steps forward and wrenches a 
    heretic girl out of the group, bending her arm a way it is not meant to go, 
    driving her down to bruise her knees on the stones of the floor. She does 
    not scream. The beads woven into her hair clack like teeth coming together. 
    He grins, and rips away one sleeve of her vesture with a languid hand.<br>
    <br>
    The room is silent but for the snapping of your torch. A lone bird cries in 
    jungle outside.</font></p>

    </b>Wintersebb Has completed the drum quest!, thanks to the great efforts of 
    all the people contributing the lvl 50-60 61-70 71-80 and 81+, we have 
    accomplished this great feat through the leadership and the organization of 
    Drache.<br>
    <br>
    The result is the Invoker, which shoots a spell that does 160-200 Slashing 
    damage with a spellcraft of 320 and only requirements are 200+ lore.<br>
    <br>
    Here are some of the screenshots<br>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">Aun 
    Tanua slowly turns towards you, surprise barely flickering across his 
    careworn eyes. He almsot reaches out to touch your arm, but conditioned 
    imprints of lightning-pain, years of throwing his fading body against 
    electric walls, jolts a recoil through his frame.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;A face. I see a face. Not Tonk. Not Atua ngamaru. I 
    see a face.&quot;<br>
    Aun 
    Tanua tells you, &quot;Atual arutoa?&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Aun Tanua sharts shivering uncontrollably and shrinks 
    within himself.<br>
    </font><font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;Not here. Not here. Not 
    here.&quot;<br>
    </font><font color="#66FF99">You give Aun Tanua Akiekie Ember.<br>
    Aun Tanua gently cups the ember in his clawed hands, and as its glow warms 
    his skin, his past gradually seeps into memory. For the first instant in an 
    endless monotony of time, he remembers. Ezheret. Palenqual. Timaru. Home.
    <br>
    As determination and strength return to the old warrior's stance, he turns 
    to you once more.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;I have no knowledge of how long 
    I have been imprisoned here. Endless half moments on moments, my memory 
    failing, my own keh draining away...All I know is that I cannot leave, for 
    the Atua ngamaru have me caputured inside these walls of light.&quot;<br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;My own Timaru is far from me, but you have brought me 
    an ember of her heart, and once again my people are with me. You must have 
    been sent with this gift by one of my brethren, and for that I thank you.&quot;<br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;There is but one way to let my brothers envision my 
    fate, and I must ask one more favor of you.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Aun Tanua lifts the akiekie ember to his face and 
    softly blows across its faintly glowing surface. As his keh suffuses the 
    ember, it suddenly fans into a flame. He holds it a moment longer, then 
    relinquishes it to your care.<br>
    Aun Tanua gives you Burning Akiekie Ember.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;Give this to the one that sent 
    you here to me. He will understand its intent and what should be done. Go 
    now, and if you ever tread upon the shores of Palenqual, let her know I am 
    with her.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
