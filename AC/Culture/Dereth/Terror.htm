    <span class="Head">
    <p>The climb to the surface had taken little time. Workers were hastily 
    completing the chamber that she had willed them to create. She observed 
    their progress, and made her way to another nest. There she was confronted 
    by a host of the little creatures. Some of the creatures were metal-clad, 
    while others wore foul-smelling skins and hides from even lesser creatures 
    that lived on this fetid island.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;All of the little things were hostile. She could feel their anxiety, 
    fear and hatred as they made their way down from the top of her children's 
    home. The water of life sizzled on the ground beneath her and guardians 
    silently found their way to her side. She explained the reason for her 
    arrival and told them to pull their forces back. Secluding herself in the 
    depths of a dark crevice, she waited for the little things to come into her 
    lair.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Things with sharp metal sticks, things with large metal heads on wooden 
    sticks, things with sticks and strings that shot smaller sticks, and things 
    with little glowing balls, crystals and rods made their way into her lair. 
    At the front, clad in the shells of her children banded together with metal, 
    was a little creature far too familiar. She knew this little thing from the 
    cries of her children who stood born of her daughter, the daughter who once 
    ruled this land. This little creature's stick with a string glowed the same 
    color as the water of life, and it smelled as her children did after they 
    were dead. She could tell that the smell was not from the metal shells 
    draped over the creature's body. There was something else.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Her children raged in the darkness, begging to be loosed upon this 
    horde, and as their anger grew so did hers toward the one little thing. The 
    insignificant speck that had somehow killed her daughter and ended the life 
    of so many more of her children was finally before her. She would have 
    revenge against this creature for her children; she would crush the life 
    from this little thing. She willed her children forward, knowing full well 
    that a great many would perish on the pointed sticks, but she would see the 
    invaders driven from her home.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Her children led the charge and the little things pulled tightly about 
    the creature she knew. The skin-wearers began to beat wooden objects 
    furiously. The sounds shook her children's shells and caused them 
    discomfort. She drove those feelings from her children's minds and renewed 
    their strength. Skin-wearers toppled and fell in heaps of life-fluid as her 
    children's hands tore through their flesh. Hide-wearers formed a wall about 
    the creature clad in shell-in-metal. She stormed at them and spewed forth 
    her venom.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Hide did little to protect their flesh and it melted away before her. 
    The familiar creature wearing shell-in-metal produced a liquid from a hide 
    sack. It smelled like her eldest children, only dead. She watched the little 
    thing coat a wooden stick with the liquid and place it on the string of its 
    glowing stick. All around, her children tore into the flesh of the creatures 
    that had come to destroy her home and slay them all. She stood over the 
    little one wearing shell-in-metal and prepared another blast of her venom.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;The little creature loosed the stick coated in the scent of death and it 
    struck her above the eye. It stung, but little else, and her venom dropped 
    over the little thing. It fell to one knee and was pulled away by metal-clad 
    creatures and hide-clad creatures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Now the little creatures fled. She recalled her children and tended to 
    their wounds, as the little creatures ran through the tunnels of her home. 
    She had won the day. Soon she would win this land. She would drive the 
    little creatures into the water of life and consume them.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The halls were silent, save for the sound of 
    their footfalls. Rytheran glanced at his companion and delved within his 
    memory. To recall the glory that they had once commanded, he was forced to 
    concentrate.&nbsp; It was difficult to do while seeing them both as they were 
    now—desiccated corpses with nary a remnant of flesh, covered in ruined 
    clothing that had once designated them as scholars and officials of their 
    race. As he focused, the glamour wove about him and repaired centuries of 
    decay. Flesh covered his bones, moth-eaten and timeworn robes were made 
    whole, and his vibrant eyes returned to fill his empty sockets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Love, I would keep you in that form for the 
    further eternity could I accept it as reality, but we both know truth beyond 
    lies, and I would ask you to not cause this undue pain. Let our memories be 
    just that, so that our tortured souls are not carved deeper still with the 
    cold blade of time.&quot; Aerfalle brushed a lock of glamorous hair away from 
    Rytheran's brow and the image faded, returning his features to a grim 
    visage. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;For so many millennia, my love, that blade 
    has etched into my being.&quot; Rytheran paused as they separated. &quot;Why now? We 
    searched for so long while the Servant walked. Why not call to us then? So 
    many of the Firstborn scattered across the deserts and lost in the war 
    against the dark spawn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We had thought Amauxi fallen during the 
    second sending. Had His Eternal Splendor seen so far into the future to hide 
    him even then? And what of the sacrifices made while the outlanders did our 
    bidding without coaxing? Had he foreseen the end of the fourth sending at 
    their hand? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Had he expected that this horde, with the 
    guidance of the last child of the Yalain, would succeed?&quot; Rytheran asked as 
    they resumed their walk down the ancient hallway.&nbsp; &quot;They are whelps, barely 
    capable of channeling the art.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;All, that is, but one.&quot; Aerfalle smirked. 
    &quot;She stirs the things that sleep, and I can sense your elation growing. You 
    think her singing will stir the Old Ones.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;'Tis true. I hold hope still that their 
    voices will rise again. But as the dark spawn grow more powerful, loosed 
    from their deepest trenches to walk the world again, I fear for Killiakta. 
    The singer knows little of what she does, and what knowledge we have of the 
    entity of energy and his delving only yields supposition that one of the K—&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;No…the sendings cannot be this close.&quot; 
    Aerfalle placed her hand on a door, crafted millennia before, and it opened 
    without sound.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;The chamber beyond housed an eclectic 
    assembly not seen since the fourth sending, when the decision was made to 
    join the battle against the Uvriliim and Paanuvriliim. Amauxi, one of the 
    first Filinuvekta, was seated between representatives from the Latzimestal 
    and the Sand Kings. Their conversation was civil, nearly hushed. Amauxi 
    stood as the Lord and Dark Lady entered the hall.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Eons have not washed away your grace and 
    beauty, Aerfalle, nor have they dimmed your presence, Lord Rytheran.&quot; Amauxi 
    bowed. As one, the assembled collection of Undead stood and greeted the 
    pair. Aerfalle and Rytheran nodded in unison, and took their places on 
    thrones that had been prepared for their arrival. Amauxi stepped next to the 
    center of the gathered Undead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;For millennia I have stood watch, and kept 
    secret the resting place of the King. Now he begs me come to all and begin 
    discourse. The outlanders draw too near failure, and this incursion of the 
    Olthoi is one he had not foreseen. The heavens are confused and muddled, and 
    singers whose voices have long been silenced are raised in a chorale that 
    nothing hears. The last child of Yalain is paralyzed, and our eyes upon him 
    have gone blind. Beloved Killiakta draws nearer to destruction than she has 
    ever been before.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Ours is an ignoble task, that beckons we 
    send an emissary to impart a gift to the outlander horde. As it is His will, 
    so it must be done.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa's face was pale. Her breathing was 
    still shallow and her eyes had not opened since the attack. She lived, but 
    no amount of magic would wake her from this cold sleep. Aun Hareltah had 
    tried all he knew to wake the Queen, but still she lay, silent and cold. 
    Antius brushed a stray lock of honey-colored hair from her brow and gently 
    kissed her forehead.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Come back to me, my love.&quot; He gently 
    touched a hand to her cheek and smiled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;A week had passed since the assault. At 
    night, Antius would stay by her side with Borelean, telling Elysa of the 
    day's exploits. It mattered little if she heard them, they each needed to 
    see her, and every once and again they swore they saw some recognition on 
    her face. The boy was showing remarkable resilience and control by holding 
    his sorrow within. Antius saw this as a blessing and a curse. The boy had 
    attempted to find Asheron only once. It ended in failure as the spell to 
    reach Asheron's Sanctum failed…as though the Sanctum were no longer there.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Everything was bleak. The festival season had 
    come to Dereth, but there was little to celebrate. The Olthoi had been 
    driven back from the majority of the countryside, but the earth still 
    trembled and the Ancient Queen was still out there somewhere. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the day, Antius joined Lord Kresovus, 
    scouring the countryside with Balor. The assailant's scent had gone dry 
    after the second day of searching, but Balor was as stubborn as his master. 
    He insisted that he had found the trail time and again, only to lose it on 
    the wind. Nuhmudira worked to find the would-be assassin through mystical 
    means, while Celdiseth, Fadsahil and Ciandra tried to formulate some manner 
    of cure. For the moment, Antius was forced to believe that Nuhmudira was 
    truly not responsible for the assault, as this was fell magic that none of 
    them understood. But his bones still grew chilled when she was about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I love you,&quot; he said as he took Elysa's hand 
    into his. He looked to the fireplace and noticed the embers there, sparks 
    popping from a small pocket of water in the wood. He saw life in that red 
    glow, and he refused to let that fire die. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Where are you, Asheron?&quot; he asked of no one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius' reverie was abruptly broken by the 
    shuffle of leather boots moving hurriedly. The sound of metal-clad boots 
    followed behind. The doors burst open as he turned toward the hall. His left 
    hand still held Elysa's gently, but his right now gripped his sword hilt, 
    relaxing only when he saw the intruders were Hendac and Jenavere. He let 
    Elysa's hand drop back to her side and walked to them. Two royal guards 
    stood behind the pair.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Sorry Lord Antius, they pushed by us too 
    quickly,&quot; one guard apologized.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;They are friends, and are welcome here,&quot; 
    Antius replied. He dismissed the guards and brought Hendac and Jenavere into 
    the room. Hendac made his way to Elysa's bedside and fell to one knee, while 
    Jenavere took a rolled sheet of paper to the table near the balustrade.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;If she saw you doing that, Hendac, she'd 
    cuss you and likely give you a swift kick.&quot; Antius managed a weak smile, and 
    the mute man smiled in return as he glanced back and got to his feet.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Antius, no time for talk. We've found her.&quot; 
    Jenavere was pointing to the scroll, a crudely drawn map showing the borders 
    of the Lost Wish Mountains. &quot;We tracked a small encampment of Gotrok Lugians 
    through the mountains. We were forced to slow our pace to match theirs, or 
    risk being seen. After a day of no movement, Hendac and I followed the ridge 
    here.&quot; She pointed to an area of the mountains that Antius barely recalled. 
    &quot;Along this ridge, we saw a marked increase in Renegade activity, but we 
    also found something else.&quot; Antius glanced back to Hendac, who happily 
    pointed at his nose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Hendac smelled it first—a hive, a big hive. 
    We looked for the entrance and found only a pocket of acrid air that seeped 
    from within the bowels of the earth, north of the mountains. We couldn't 
    find a way in…but that is where she is roosting. I know it.&quot; She poked her 
    finger at a spot on scroll.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How deep?&quot; Antius asked. Hendac sat in the 
    chair beside Elysa's bed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Hard to say,&quot; Jenavere replied, looking at 
    Antius' face. &quot;How long has it been since you've slept?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Long enough. How many Olthoi?&quot; Antius 
    responded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Thousands, I'm sure of that. And she's 
    breeding...quickly,&quot; Jenavere stated plainly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius nodded and called for a guard. The 
    door opened and a guard walked into the room. &quot;Assemble the council. We have 
    the location of the Queen's lair.&quot; The guard nodded and left the room.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The council, Antius?&quot; Jenavere protested. 
    &quot;They'll discuss this into the ground before anything is done, and then it 
    will be too late.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No, Jenavere. The council is very different 
    now.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Different? The only ones that were ever 
    worth their lot were Elysa and Celdiseth. The rest be damned. Scholars and 
    fools! Nuhmudira was one of the Zaikhal scholars that refused to provide us 
    with the munitions necessary to crush the remaining Olthoi hives. We know 
    how that ended. I'm sure you've heard about the colony of humans beneath the 
    Catacombs where Elysa slew the first queen. They're not to be trusted,&quot;&nbsp; 
    Jenavere continued.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I don't trust them, Jenavere, but they're 
    all we have…Nuhmudira included. Nuhmudira is arguably the most powerful of 
    us. She very well might be our only hope. I wish I could convey to you how 
    much it pains me to say that,&quot; Antius conceded blandly as he returned to the 
    table. &quot;We can't do this alone. We need all the help we can muster, and if 
    that means that we need to deal with those we cannot trust to ensure the 
    safety of this world and our way of life, so be it. I will not go back to a 
    slave pit.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nor will I.&quot; Nuhmudira opened the door, 
    flanked by a guard. &quot;The others are coming post-haste. What news do you have 
    for us, Antius?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jenavere looked to Hendac. He knelt and 
    kissed Elysa's hand. Jenavere took a step toward Antius and whispered, 
    &quot;We'll be around, Antius…but we won't fight with her.&quot; She smiled and 
    clasped the man in a brief embrace. Hendac approached Antius and clapped him 
    on the back. Then the two pushed past Nuhmudira into the hallway.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira waited until they disappeared into 
    the darkness and then asked, &quot;What was that all about?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;They found the Queen.&quot;</font></p>

    <font size="2">
    <p><font face="Arial">Asheron sat in a high-backed chair. His attendants lay 
    in crumpled heaps upon the floor. The magic to bind their limbs together and 
    power their minds had been washed away. He could no longer leave this room. 
    He had neither the means nor the strength. Food was plentiful enough to last 
    him for another passing of the seasons at the most. The only light came from 
    a single candle resting on a simple wooden table at his side.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">On his lap, the writings of his father and the 
    brightest scholars of his age lay open to pages that explained the processes 
    for alchemically crafting poisons. He was incapable of frustration; it had 
    only been two full cycles of Alb'arel and Rez'arel. Though he feared that 
    Elysa was gone, as well as her dear boy, he hoped that there were still 
    Isparians left who fought against the Olthoi. For their sake he would not 
    cease his study.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Nuhmudira was the last Isparian he had seen. She had 
    come nearly two months prior espousing her willingness to assist him. He 
    agreed and furnished Nuhmudira with the details of his studies to that 
    point, sending her back to Elysa with a message that they would work 
    together to find a way to drive the Olthoi back. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Asheron did not know if Nuhmudira had delivered the 
    message. She had never returned, and shortly after her departure the higher 
    magics within his tower had failed. This left him blind to the outside world 
    and, after the failure of the conveyance systems, stranded within the 
    confines of this room. Portal magic was rent asunder and he relegated 
    himself to waiting for a sign that the Isparians were alive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Only two months had passed without word, a far shorter 
    time than he had been alone before, but the area about him was devoid of 
    mana and magic. This brought a heavy weight to his heart. The old mage rose 
    and placed the books upon the table beside him. Taking up the candle from 
    the table, he moved across the room and sat at a table covered in clean 
    sheaves of paper and simple quills.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">There, he began to write of the last days of Auberean.</font></p>
    </font><font size="-2">
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">The Ongoing Saga</font></h2>
    </font><font size="2">
    <p><font face="Arial">Last month, the olthoi swarmed over Dereth. From coast 
    to coast, from the mountains to the forests, the Olthoi ruled the land. But 
    the heroes of Dereth learned how to enter their nests and drive them back 
    into their underground dens.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The greatest battles took place in the Direlands. As 
    many fought their way down into one strongly-defended nest, High Queen Elysa 
    Strathelar took a contingent of allies and guards into yet another. While 
    the assault on the first nest was a success and the Direlands were freed of 
    the Olthoi menace, Elysa's assault met with dismal failure. They were met by 
    an ancient olthoi queen, more powerful than any that had been seen before by 
    Isparians, and her battle cadre failed to damage or hinder her. Firing an 
    arrow, enchanted and poisoned by Nuhmudira and Asheron, Elysa had hoped to 
    topple the reign of this olthoi queen. As warriors fell around her, she was 
    forced to retreat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">After returning to thank the efforts of the Isparians 
    who had assisted with the removal of the Olthoi across Dereth, Elysa plead 
    with her council to join together to rid Dereth of the Olthoi. As the 
    council departed, a lone assassin -- Oswald -- made his way into the room 
    and struck Elysa a mortal blow. Now the High Queen lays comatose, the victim 
    of a poison that threatens to snuff out her life, regardless of Asheron's 
    protection. The Olthoi have surged forth once again, and the people of 
    Dereth look for leadership. Who will rise to the role?</font></p>
    </font><font size="-2">
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Fellowship Changes</font></h2>
    <font size="2">
    <p><font face="Arial">Following up last month's improvements to the 
    Fellowship Changes, we're pleased to introduce two new features for 
    Fellowships -- fellowship leadership transfers, and open fellowships.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Leadership Transfers: </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In the past, if the leader of your fellowship had to 
    leave the game, it was necessary to disband and reform your fellowship. No 
    longer! One of the two new buttons on the Fellowship Panel is the <i>Leader
    </i>button. The leader of any fellowship can click on the <i>Leader</i> 
    button, then click a fellowship member in the Fellowship Panel. The member 
    selected becomes the new leader of the fellowship instantly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In addition, if the leader of a Fellowship leaves the 
    game for any reason, leadership of the Fellowship will be passed to another 
    member, randomly. The Fellowship will no longer automatically disband.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b>Open Fellowships:</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">At any time, the leader of a fellowship can change the 
    fellowship into an open fellowship by clicking on the new <i>Open</i> button 
    on the Fellowship Panel. The button will change to a <i>Close</i> button and 
    all members' <i>Recruit</i> buttons will light up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Open fellowships work exactly like normal fellowships 
    except for one difference: In an open fellowship, any fellowship member may 
    recruit new members by clicking on the <i>Recruit </i>button. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">At any time, the leader can close the fellowship by 
    clicking on the <i>Close</i> button. An open fellowship can be closed by the 
    leader. Just click on the <i>Close</i> button. When the fellowship is 
    closed, only the leader will be able to recruit new members.</font></p>
    </font>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Weeping Weapon Changes</font></h2>
    <font size="2">
    <p><font face="Arial">After continued testing, and listening to your 
    feedback, we determined that the Weeping Weapons, and particularly two of 
    the melee weapons, needed some slight improvements. As of today, you'll see 
    the following changes:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font face="Arial">All Weeping Weapons now have an Arcane Lore 
      requirement of 50. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">The Weeping Spear and Weeping Axe have had their 
      damage variance improved slightly. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">All melee Weeping Weapons have had their slayer 
      bonus increased slightly.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial">As always, we will watch these changes carefully, and 
    continue to adjust balance when necessary.</font></p>
    </font>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Festival Celebrations Delayed</font></h2>
    <font size="2">
    <p><font face="Arial">In past years, October has been the beginning of the 
    festival months of Dereth. The three mask makers and their apprentices 
    usually invented new colorful masks that players could have made from the 
    heads of monsters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, the continued olthoi assaults and the 
    attack on the High Queen have delayed their efforts. You won't see as many 
    new masks this month as you have in past years. If the brave defenders of 
    Dereth can find a way to defeat the olthoi, the festival celebrations -- 
    including new masks -- should return.</font></p>
    </font>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">Stackable Writs of Refuge</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In response to numerous player requests, we 
    have made the Writs of Refuge stackable. To do so, it was necessary to 
    remove the lore from them. For players who would like to read the lore that 
    was once found on the Writs, they can purchase the text from the apprentice 
    Arcanum craftsmen in Cragstone, Zaikhal, and Hebian-To.</font></p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/oct_lttp.htm">AC Insider</a></span></font></small><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Welcome to the October 2003 Letter to the 
    Players. As the forces of Dereth focus on ridding the land of the Olthoi, we 
    can't help but wonder what lies on the horizon.</em></font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">PK Lite Corpse Timer</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting with the October event, PK Lite 
    corpses will follow the same rules as monster corpses. If they are opened 
    and closed, they will decay immediately. If they are never opened, they will 
    decay in five minutes. This should help cut down on the graphics impact 
    caused by PK Lite combat in high-traffic areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we initially proposed PK Lite and asked 
    for feedback on our forums, the majority of players responded that they did 
    want corpses. Unfortunately, since PK Lite has been so popular, there's been 
    a problem with too many corpses. We could take them out of the game, but as 
    they were included by request, we would prefer to leave them. In addition, 
    leaving them as they are gives us the option to create some form of PK Lite 
    death trophy in the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We thank you all for helping to clean up your 
    corpses in the meantime, and ask that you continue to do so even after these 
    changes. </font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Masks</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We've traditionally added new masks each 
    October. This year, in addition to any other content we might add, we'll be 
    tweaking the existing Virindi and heritage masks. We're bringing all masks 
    into line with the current creature difficulty breakdowns, and some are 
    being made more useful. These changes may include how you obtain and repair 
    the masks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most important change, and the one we 
    feel is necessary to mention in advance, will be to the requirements of 
    Pwyll's Guard, the Shroud of Night, and the higher-level Koji's Beast. These 
    three masks previously had wield requirements of 300 base skill in Dagger, 
    Staff, and Unarmed, respectively. These are being changed to activation 
    requirements of 350 buffed skill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We felt that players like to wear the 
    heritage masks for decoration and fun, and that the wield requirements of 
    the high-level masks prevented them from being used in this fashion. While 
    the change should not impact many players, we wanted to let you know ahead 
    of time so that it doesn't take you by surprise.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Fellowship Improvements</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month, we made some changes to the 
    fellowship system. You no longer need to walk over to someone to recruit 
    them into your fellowship, and we gave you an option to automatically accept 
    fellowship requests.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This month you'll be seeing additional 
    fellowship improvements, plus two new features: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fellowships will no longer automatically 
      disband if the leader quits or is disconnected. Fellowship leaders can 
      also assign leadership to a different character. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players can create Open Fellowships, which 
      allow any member to recruit new members.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also believe we have fixed the bug that 
    could, in certain situations, change your target to a fellowship member. 
    You'll find more details regarding these changes in the Rollout Article!</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">The October Event</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Judging by our schedule in past months, you 
    would expect the October event to take place a week and a half after this 
    Letter is posted. This month, however, the event will be roughly a week 
    later than normal. Our current target for the event is the last week in 
    October.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Zone has plans for annual maintenance in 
    late October, and asked us if we would be willing to push our event back a 
    week. This was to ensure that none of their maintenance would impact our 
    event in any way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To get you through the extra week, the teaser 
    will be a little longer than usual, and spread out over a few days. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other event news, the October download 
    will be larger than usual. (If you watch the splash screens after the 
    download is complete, you'll see one of the reasons why.)</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">The AC:DM Website</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're planning a number of changes for the
    <a href="http://acdm.turbinegames.com/" target="_blank">Turbine AC:DM 
    website</a>, including a total revamp of the AC:DM forums. We mention it 
    here because we may need to take the entire site down for a week or more as 
    we make these updates. Current plans have this downtime happening just after 
    the October event, but it may be shifted earlier or later as necessary. 
    We'll be posting more information on the site and on the forums as it 
    becomes available.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Looking Forward</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In previous years, October has been the 
    beginning of the winter festival months, a &quot;break&quot; from the more intense 
    action of previous months. As you can see by the continued Olthoi attacks, 
    however, this October will be anything but a break! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result, November and December will be 
    our festival months. They may feel a little different from the past few 
    months of story-driven content. In these two months, we'll be focusing on 
    fixing bugs, cleaning up existing content, and trying to implement a few 
    pieces of content that didn't quite fit with the most recent story arc. So 
    there will be interesting new content, but not epic storyline content.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That's all we've got for today! Remember that 
    a number of details that you used to see in the Letter to the Players can 
    now be found in the Rollout Article, which is posted on the day of the 
    event. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">See you in Dereth!</font></p>
