    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a sharp crack as her mace struck 
    the carapace of the Olthoi and the creature fell to one knee. As it 
    struggled to regain its footing, Madison raised her mace to strike the 
    Olthoi's skull. It was unable to deflect the blow with its pincers, and her 
    mace shattered the creature's exoskeleton. The insect let out a dying wail 
    and ceased its struggle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her companion, Gruvlin, glanced over from the 
    creature he was busily looting.&nbsp; &quot;Did you ever think you'd see it?&quot; he 
    asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She and Gruvlin had been dispatched by the 
    High Queen to determine if the rumors trickling in of creature migrations 
    were true. The number of Olthoi they'd encountered was all the proof Madison 
    needed that at least some of the tales were true. Yet the question of why 
    remained unanswered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No,&quot; Madison said wearily, her voice laden 
    with weight. In every direction she heard chittering and saw the claws of 
    Olthoi. &quot;This makes no sense, Gruvlin.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Sense or no, it's true.&quot; Gruvlin smiled as 
    he held up a necklace fitted with a bright fire opal. He thrust the necklace 
    into a pack, reached down to the corpse again, and pulled a key from the 
    gullet of the creature. After wiping it clean of ichor, he clipped it to a 
    ring he pulled from his pack.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He slowly stood and said, &quot;Let's continue our 
    patrol.&quot; </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A raid?&quot;&nbsp; Marvus gripped the&nbsp; strap of his 
    shield tighter. &quot;Good, let them come! We shall spill their blood on the 
    field of battle this day.&quot; He snickered. &quot;The Chorus of Mages remains 
    unaware of our new armaments. They shall at last feel the bite of my blade 
    whilst I wade through their hail of summoned fire and acid.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he stroked his beard, Asheron continued, 
    &quot;You see Ciandra, this island was once a place of rest for the ruling Yalain, 
    although it was already steeped in history and shrouded in a great number of 
    mysteries that your people are still discovering.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron had arrived at the Temple of 
    Forgetfulness the day before and had asked Ciandra to show him around. He 
    was quizzical and jovial, more so than the last time she had seen him. Now, 
    as he poked into the corners and inhaled the air heavy with pollen, it 
    almost seemed to her that a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It's been centuries since I have seen this 
    place. Little has changed, other than the baths are shallower and the steam 
    vents are filled with the former caretakers-turned-assailants.&quot; He paused 
    for a moment, and turned toward her. &quot;Some day, I mean to gather as many 
    golems as I can and fix them.&quot; Then a wry smile crossed his face. &quot;Though 
    there are other concerns, I suppose.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He then turned to one of the bookcases on the 
    wall. &quot;Ah, the memories of this place. I don't believe that we ever found 
    the source of the magic here. We of course had our speculations, but nothing 
    was ever discovered. These fountains would rejuvenate my race. We'd feel 
    younger from being here for but a few moments, as if we were bathed in the 
    potency of the very thing that created all that there is.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He turned to Ciandra once more. &quot;I wouldn't 
    be surprised if your discoveries here have begun a process that will open 
    your bodies and minds to greater knowledge and ability.&quot; His eyes turned, 
    and he seemed to be looking into the distance. &quot;Of course, there is never 
    anything that does not come at a price. I wonder what that price will be.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aerbax's thoughts appeared in the mind of the 
    Master. &quot;Now, subject, you shall be exposed to the source of energy for a 
    period of time. If all goes well, you shall be enhanced as Puppets before 
    you have been. Are you prepared?&quot; The Master's affirmative response was 
    quick in coming.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Puppet, let the exposure begin,&quot; Aerbax 
    commanded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The floating slab inched closer and closer to 
    the inky darkness floating in one corner of the room until finally thin 
    wisps of pure black stabbed out of the darkness. The wisps infiltrated the 
    Master's cloak, and Aerbax could see the violet color of the cloak change. 
    As the color shifted to deep maroon and then to the bluish purple of 
    midnight, a shrill squeal tore through the room. Finally the squeal stopped, 
    and Puppet pulled the slab back from the darkness and released the subject.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aerbax nodded in satisfaction. Another 
    success. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>That Which is Ours</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Not all that happens in Dereth shakes the 
    world, but even small events can leave mysteries behind them. One such 
    begins in the town of Rithwic…</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Delton Hardor was surprised by Tamian's 
    sudden interest in challenging him to combat, even if that combat was only 
    with wooden practice swords. Tamian had never shown interest in swordplay or 
    combat before. Nor, in Delton's opinion had Tamian ever shown interest in 
    anything that benefited the community. He did not hunt, did not farm, did 
    not craft items of utility, and certainly did not help defend Rithwic, even 
    from the Drudges. The look on Astara's face seemed to imply she thought his 
    behavior was strange as well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although his grip on the wooden sword was 
    unsure, Tamian seemed more determined than Delton had ever seen him. Curious 
    to see how he would react, Delton allowed Tamian the first attack. After 
    Delton easily parried his thrust, Tamian hesitated, almost as if he realized 
    how out of place he was. Then the hesitation passed and Tamian swung at 
    Delton's legs. Delton parried this one as easily as the first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Honestly,&quot; Delton thought as he moved in 
    closer to Tamian. &quot;Tamian handles that sword like a farmer swinging a hoe.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Delton delivered a swift blow to Tamian's 
    sword arm, throwing him off balance and spinning him around. He followed 
    this with a blow to Tamian's backside. Delton could not help but laugh at 
    how ridiculous all this was. Did Tamian actually think he stood a chance?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tamian's face turned red. He leaped at 
    Delton, swinging wildly. Delton's well-practiced parries blocked the blows, 
    and he swatted Tamian again and again.&nbsp; This worthless cur would learn a 
    lesson today.</font></p>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters may now devote 64 skill

      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As part of our redistribution of monsters, 
      we've tried to define more level-centric hunting grounds. This will give 
      players looking for landscape hunting a specific area in which to hunt. 
      The character level ranges we have defined for these hunting grounds are:
      </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Newbie: 1 - 20 </font></li>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, creatures found in a Low level 
      hunting ground should be those that are appealing (in both their 
      experience reward and treasure they provide) to a character between levels 
      1 and 20. The only exception to this would be creatures that protect 
      special treasure chests. These creatures may still seem out of place for 
      the area in which they are found.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to redistributing monsters 
      along character level lines, we've begun the process of rebalancing 
      monsters along those same lines. Depending on the creature, this may 
      involve tweaks to the monster's melee, missile, and magic defenses. It may 
      also involve revising the level of spell it casts and the experience 
      reward it provides. Due to the amount of time involved, for February we 
      were only able to balance creatures found in the Newbie areas of the 
      world. In March we'll complete this rebalancing process, but for now 
      players may come across a monster that seems tougher or easier than those 
      surrounding it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The resistance to Drain provided by a 
      character's Endurance was not being applied correctly when some spells 
      were draining health. We have corrected this. The target character's drain 
      resistance is now applied during any health-draining spell attacks. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As discussed in the
      <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/lttp_0203.htm">Letter to the 
      Players</a>, we've tweaked the Olthoi Queen quest slightly: </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Olthoi Eviscerators that spray you, 
        thus allowing you to enter the Royal Hive, are spraying you more often.
        </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aun Hareltah no longer changes your 
        title without asking you. Instead, he hands you a token. If you'd like 
        your title changed to &quot;Queenslayer,&quot; just hand him the token back.
        </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aun Hareltah's logic has been changed 
        slightly. He shouldn't stamp you as having completed the quest unless 
        you've actually received the reward. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The quest can now be repeated every 
        three months. </font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ivory may now be applied to Bandit Weapons 
      so that they can be taken out of a character's inventory and stored.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've implemented some fixes to help 
      address duplicate hooks and storage chests. Please see this month's
      <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/lttp_0203.htm">Letter to the 
      Player</a> for more details. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">On very rare occasions, a hook could 
      become unlinked from its house. This could, in turn, cause any items in 
      those hooks to be lost. Therefore, we've changed the behavior of houses 
      when they are loaded by the server. As it loads, a house essentially 
      verifies that its hooks &quot;know&quot; which house they belong to. It should no 
      longer be possible for a hook to become unlinked from the house that owns 
      it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It was sometimes possible for a house to 
      mistakenly register that more of its hooks were being used than was really 
      the case. Houses now do a more accurate inventory of the hooks they own, 
      so this mistake shouldn't occur in the future. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When we gave mansions more hooks, we said 
      that the update gave the mansions 100 hooks and that players could use all 
      100 of these hooks. However, in reality mansions each had 100 above-ground 
      hooks and 41 below-ground hooks. We've updated mansions so that you can 
      now use all 141 hooks.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Minor Details</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've corrected a situation that could 
      cause the Player Killer portal use restrictions to be triggered 
      accidentally by the use of some recall and dispel spells. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The chests found scattered throughout the 
      &quot;Valley of Death&quot; have a much longer regeneration cycle, allowing more 
      people to loot each chest before it locks again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Neydisa Hauberk got a bit more useful.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've spoken to Larry the Bunny Master 
      again, and he says he'll try to be around his cottage a bit more.</font></li>

    Asheron's Call</em> Letter to the Players. The AC Live team has been 
    extremely busy this past month, and February will bring some interesting 
    changes to Dereth.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Monster Redistribution</strong><br>
    Have you ever seen a Snowy Mattekar in the middle of the desert? Or a 
    swamp-dwelling Mosswart hanging out in the snow on a tall mountain? Well, 
    when the Virindi story arc ended, the creatures of Dereth went through a 
    shift from their old homes to new ones based off of a more consistent level 
    structure. While this created more definable areas for players to hunt in, 
    it also placed creatures in previously non-native areas. For February, we 
    are revamping the monster generators to create hunting areas that are based 
    on a more consistent leveling structure but adhere to the history, 
    background and nature of the creatures that will be used in these areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We strongly recommend logging out in a safe 
    area before the February prop-and by &quot;safe,&quot; we don't mean your favorite 
    muling spot in the Dires!-Try inside your house or a city.&nbsp; This is going be 
    a multi-prop process; this month you'll see monsters redistributed, and next 
    month they will be going through a rebalancing phase.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Housing Issues</strong><br>
    Several months ago, we posted an article about duplicated housing objects 
    and how they affect you. We have continued our quest to eliminate duplicated 
    housing objects, and although we have not yet completely solved this 
    problem, we have made significant progress.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, this month we have made several 
    small changes that should help the owners of houses with duplicated hooks or 
    storage resolve their situations more easily. Starting with the February 
    update, duplicated housing objects will attempt to synchronize with the 
    house that owns them so that when the house is loaded, the duplicate object 
    has the current owner information. This will fix the problem in which a new 
    owner does not have access to hooks or storage duplicated before he or she 
    purchased the house. It is important that you can access any duplicated 
    housing objects in order to clean them out. Starting in February, duplicated 
    objects will automatically delete themselves, but only if they are empty. 
    The February event will also see some new code that better synchronizes the 
    number of hooks that you have in use at any one time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few months ago we released information on 
    how to determine if you had duplicate hooks and storage in your house. That 
    information is now obsolete. The information below explains how to tell if 
    you have duplicate housing objects and what you can do if your housing 
    objects have been duplicated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>How do I tell if I have duplicated 
    hooks/chests?</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can determine if you have duplicated 
    housing objects by using the [ and ] keys on your keyboard to select the 
    items near you. If you have two or more storage chests, for instance, you 
    will be able to flip between both chests using the [ and ] keys, even though 
    you can only see one chest and select one chest with the mouse. Once you 
    have selected one of the duplicated housing objects with the keyboard, use 
    the R key to open the object so that you can remove the contents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>How do I get rid of the duplicated 
    hooks/chests?</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have identified a duplicated hook or 
    chest, empty both instances. When you empty the &quot;fake&quot; copy of the 
    hook/chest, you will see a message explaining that the hook/chest was a 
    duplicate and that it will now be deleted. The hook or chest will disappear 
    a few seconds later. Please note that the duplicated hook/chest will NOT 
    disappear until it is empty, so you must remove all objects-including empty 
    backpacks-from the chest. Once the duplicate hook/chest has disappeared, it 
    will be safe once again to use the &quot;real&quot; instance of your hook or chest 
    that remains.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>What if I'm not around when my hooks and 
    storage duplicate? Will I lose everything?</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The primary risk of item loss from duplicated 
    housing objects occurs when you are transferring items to and from your 
    hooks or storage, since you may unknowingly place an item in a duplicated 
    storage object. As a result of the February fix, you can no longer add items 
    to a duplicated hook or chest-if you attempt to do so, you will see a 
    message explaining that this is a duplicated object and that you should 
    empty it immediately. So the risk of losing items due to duplicated housing 
    objects is very small. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A special note for villa owners: One model of 
    villa has two hooks located in the same place (in the corner of the room 
    that contains the portal into the dungeon). This is not actually a 
    duplicated hook situation; both of these hooks are legitimate hooks 
    correctly linked to your house. Therefore, one of these hooks will not 
    delete itself when empty. Because these two hooks overlap, there is some 
    potential for strange interactions between the physics of hooked objects. 
    Therefore, we recommend that you only use one of these hooks at a time.

    We've modified the Queen's Quest slightly to help those who may have been 
    flagged as having finished the quest but never got the quest reward. To 
    address this issue, we've adjusted the Queen's Quest so that it can be 
    repeated every three months. If you completed the quest more than three 
    months ago-even if you completed it successfully-you will now be able to 
    repeat the quest and receive the reward. How do you tell if your timer has 
    expired and you are allowed to repeat the quest? You can find out by 
    speaking to one of the Tumeroks in Timaru. If they no longer greet you as &quot;Queenslayer&quot; 
    or talk about your brave exploits defeating the Olthoi Queen, you can 
    complete the quest again.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    <strong>Post-Creation Specialization Limit</strong><br>
    When post-character creation skill untraining and specialization were 
    introduced, we instituted a limit of 50 skill credits that could be invested 
    in specializing skills. This was the same limit newly created characters 
    had. Further discussion of the system led us to decide that at some point 
    we'd want to increase that limit; however, we wanted to evaluate what 
    changes this might have on the game before we did so. We wanted to give 
    ourselves time to observe the effects of the skill specialization system 
    since it would be nearly impossible to revert unbalanced characters, and we 
    wanted to be careful of going overboard. Now that we understand the effects 
    of the system, we feel that our previous concerns have been addressed. We 
    have raised the limit to what we'd originally proposed; i.e., to 64 skill 
    credits. Some of you got to take advantage of this a bit early because some 
    of the code snuck through in January, but in February everyone will be able 
    to spend 64 skill credits in specializing skills. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That's it for the big changes in February. Of 
    course, that's not all that we have in store for you in the future, but for 
    further updates on content, you'll just have to wait and see… As always, 
    enjoy the game, and thank you for playing Asheron's Call.&nbsp; </font></p>

    Monster Rebalacing FAQ - </span></font></b><font size="2">
    <span lang="en-us">From the
    <a href="http://www.accmty.com/idealbb/view.asp?topicID=33265&amp;sessionID=%7B5E98142E-DA80-416C-B1C3-7123DF15A33D%7D" target="_blank">
    Community Boards</a></span></font></span></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Why rebalance monsters?<br>
    <br>
    A. While it may appear that monster difficulty was not broken, it has become 
    apparent through the several years of Asheron's Call development that at any 
    given time one &quot;class&quot; of character is more pronounced and able than the 
    others. This has been due to an imbalance in creature defenses. We are 
    adjusting this to bring a more acceptable level of difficulty for creatures.<br>
    <br>
    2) What does &quot;rebalance&quot; mean?<br>
    <br>
    A. Rebalance means adjusting the skills of the creatures to be more 
    indicative of their level of difficulty.<br>
    <br>
    3) Is it true that you are adjusting creature levels to more closely mirror 
    player levels?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes; in a sense. But not in a restrictive manner. We are not looking to 
    create cookie cutter levels. We are trying to give a more adequate 
    representation of the creature level. In some instances those levels will 
    only be geared toward an archer of that level, in others a mage or melee 
    character. The level is now just a more useful tool for you, the player to 
    gauge what you can or cannot fight.<br>
    <br>
    4) I've heard that you are &quot;nerfing&quot; missile characters; is this true?<br>
    <br>
    A. No. Missile characters are having nothing done to them directly. What has 
    been stated is that the skill that most creatures are having adjusted is 
    their missile defense. This will alter, in some cases, the creatures that 
    missile characters were hunting. The most relevant cases however are those 
    characters that were hunting creature far above their level.<br>
    <br>
    5) I like/hate the new monster spawns; why did you do this?<br>
    <br>
    A. During the Virindi story arc the monster redistribution was a result of 
    virindi influence over the world. Now that the virindi are no longer 
    influencing the land some creatures have begun a natural migration, while 
    others make their way across the lands for their own dire purposes.<br>
    <br>
    6) Are the new creatures (Drudge Bloodletters, Banderling Scalpers and 
    Predators, Sclavus Lords and Olthoi Warriors) balanced?<br>
    <br>
    A. Olthoi Warriors are almost right where we want them. The Bloodletters, 
    Scalpers, Predators and Lords are very close, though not perfect.<br>
    <br>
    7) If you are adjusting creature levels how am I going to earn experience 
    with the xp reduction code?<br>
    <br>
    A. Every effort is being made to ensure that leveling does not become a 
    tedious measure of diminishing returns. To that end creatures are being 
    designed for a certain level of player but being given a generous buffer in 
    which the creature is still worthwhile to hunt. This does not mean that 
    players will feel it necessary to hunt one grouping of creature until they 
    level. <br>
    (ex. Gardok has hunted Olthoi Soldiers as his main source of leveling 
    creature from level 40-50. He now finds that the soldiers [Level 61] have 
    become simple yet still yield good experience. He has attempted to hunt 
    Nobles before, but often found that he cannot hit them reliably enough to 
    earn the same amount of experience as he can off of soldiers. With the new 
    rebalancing complete he decides to test them out again and finds that he is 
    earning more experience on the Nobles now than he was on the soldiers.)<br>
    <br>
    8) Are you adjusting creature experience?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes. Creatures will reward you based on their difficulty. Most creatures 
    will see an increase in the amount of experience that they yield, but there 
    will be some that see a reduction. The goal is to stop the feeling of a 
    leveling treadmill after level 80.<br>
    <br>
    9) How is experience calculated?<br>
    <br>
    A. While we cannot give you the exact model for this, we can give you some 
    insight as to how we are calculating the creatures experience. We first 
    determine the level of character that the creature is designed for then 
    determine whether the creature is designed with more deadly skills than 
    others, (Does it have War Magic, is it Hollow does it have a breath weapon?) 
    if the creature does an enhancement modifier is added to the creature. We 
    then determine how many characters would ideally be suited to face this 
    creature. That number influences the experience yield as well. The final 
    determinant is the creatures skills. The higher these are the better the 
    experience.<br>
    <br>
    10) Are you taking away solo advancement?<br>
    <br>
    A. Certainly not. We are well aware that one of the draws of Asheron's Call 
    is the fact that a player can advance through levels alone. Creatures may be 
    better suited for being faced off by multiple players but they are still 
    very soloable. Again though a group may increase the amount of experience 
    that you can earn over time significantly, but this has been the case for a 
    while.<br>
    <br>
    11) What about the offensive skills of creatures?<br>
    <br>
    A. These are being adjusted as well.<br>
    <br>
    12) If you are adjusting creature skills is there hope that player skills 
    like melee defense, missile defense and magic defense will have more use?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes. Part of this rebalance is to give credence to skills that players 
    have chosen to pay attention to.<br>
    <br>

    when the Virindi story arc ended, the creatures of Dereth went through a 
    shift from their old homes to new ones based off of a more consistent level 
    structure. While this created more definable areas for players to hunt in, 
    it also placed creatures in previously non-native areas. For February, we 
    are revamping the monster generators to create hunting areas that are based 
    on a more consistent leveling structure but adhere to the history, 
    background and nature of the creatures that will be used in these areas.<br>
