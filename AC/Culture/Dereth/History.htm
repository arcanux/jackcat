      <span class="Head"><b>WHAT CAME BEFORE</b></span><br>
      In ancient times a powerful race -- the Empyrean -- flourished across the
      island of Dereth. Their empire fell into ruin when the Empyrean magician
      Asheron accidentally opened a portal to another world, ushering in hordes
      of vicious monsters known as Olthoi. Asheron sent the Empyrean into a
      dimension between worlds and stayed behind to try to find a way to defeat
      the Olthoi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Empyrean's flight opened additional
      portals that summoned other creatures to Dereth, among them humans from
      the world of Ispar. For many years the humans lived as Olthoi slaves, but
      a band of rebels -- led by the noblewoman Elysa Strathelar and the warrior
      Thorsten Cragstone -- chose to fight. Aided by Asheron's magic, they slew
      the Olthoi queen and won freedom, though the fight cost Thorsten his life.
      Now, ten years later, Elysa has vanished and Asheron's whereabouts are
      unknown.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>ISPAR: THE WORLD THAT
      WAS</b></span><br>
      Ispar is home to many different cultures, including the warlike Aluvians,
      the scholarly Gharu'ndim, and the disciplined Sho. Recently, portals began
      to appear there. They seemed to exert a mystical pull upon those who saw
      them, almost as though someone were beckoning from the other side.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most adventurous answered the call and
      were transported to Dereth, with no way to return. At first the portals
      appeared only in the land of Aluvia, but in recent years they have spread
      to Gharu'n and the Sho realms. Their spread may well continue into other
      lands.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>DERETH: THE WORLD
      THAT IS</b></span><br>
      When humans first arrived in Dereth it was a world in ruins, overrun with
      ferocious creatures. Faced with the prospect that they might never return
      to Ispar, humans have made the island their new home. They have built
      towns and carved out small pockets of safety in a perilous world.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though the Empyrean have vanished, some of
      what they wrought remains: magic flows through the land; mystical portals
      carry travelers many miles in a heartbeat, enchanted Lifestones bind the
      spirits of those who use them, allowing the dead to be resurrected. Those
      who come back to life find that some of their life force has been drained
      away -- some say to power Asheron's magic. Even more ancient secrets may
      lie amid the crumbled remnants of Empyrean society.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>THE WORLD THAT COULD
      BE</b></span><br>
      Many challenges await newcomers to Dereth. Exploring the island is both
      dangerous and rewarding: monsters lurk everywhere, especially in the
      hostile Direlands, and wondrous sights, both natural and crafted by the
      Empyrean, await the adventurous. Scores of dungeons -- some built by the
      Empyrean for arcane purposes, others dug by the Olthoi or other creatures
      as lairs -- riddle the earth. Somewhere among these is the stronghold of
      Asheron himself, its location lost with Elysa Strathelar and waiting to be
      found again.</font>
      <p><img border="0" src="Victory/Hist.JPG.html" width="192" height="144"><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron has summoned many to Dereth; only
      the bravest have answered the call. Here, warriors will battle creatures
      of awesome might, magicians will discover magical items and create new
      spells, and rogues will seek out precious treasure. Quests will impel
      adventurers to uncover the wealth and lore of legend. Adventurers will
      form allegiances and fellowships, for often many can accomplish what one
      alone cannot.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The island of Dereth is strange, beautiful,
      and perilous. Power and riches are here for the taking. Many mysteries
      wait to be explored and solved, not the least of which is the whereabouts
      of the lost Empyrean race. And, it is said, there is a deep and ancient
      darkness at the heart of things, striving to reawaken. These tasks are not
      for the faint of heart -- brave adventurers are needed to explore the
      dangerous wilds, delve the deepest catacombs, and rise as rulers in this
      new world.</font>

      10PY / Earth: December 1999</b></span><br>
      In the month known as Frostfell, the isle of Dereth was beset by a sudden
      freeze. As mages scrambled to explain the dropping temperatures, the
      snowline dipped down from the lofty peaks of the Lost Wish and Linvak
      mountain ranges, until the entire island was coated with several inches of
      snow. Even the Gharu'ndim, deep in the hot and barren A'mun desert, awoke
      one morn to find their stately brick courtyards blanketed with white. In
      Samsur, the Fountain of Musansayn froze solid.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Somewhere in the wastes, the exploration
      party of Sir Joffre Tremblant fell afoul of dark forces. The legendary
      Knight of the Golden Flame order had gone in search of a fabled lost city
      alluded to in certain Empyrean texts. At first, his party was presumed
      lost in the blinding snows. Intrepid bands followed his meandering path
      from Arwic to Stonehold, gathering clues to his final destination. Along
      the way, many assisted the aims of Lady Tallial of Neydisa Castle, or
      those of her rival MacDugal in the Bandit Castle. Others grappled with
      Hoary Mattekars, ferocious mountain creatures the size of a house. The
      hides of these creatures, when given to the skilled tradesmen of Dereth,
      were quickly turned into fine Mattekar Robes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the assistance of the scholars of
      Zaikhal, the search parties discovered the path to the mysterious
      underground city of Frore. Here the fate of the Tremblant Party stood
      revealed; the group had been slain and then turned into undead slaves by
      an ancient cult of Empyrean necromancers calling themselves the Gelidites.
      In the depths of the frozen hell of Frore, adventurers struggled through
      legions of undead sorcerers, who were lead by a council of three dark
      priests. These three, Ferundi, Frisander, and Fenngar by name, were slain
      at the gates of the city. In the deepest caverns, parties were brought up
      short by a cadre of Gelidite Lords lead by the powerful sorcerer Frisirth.
      The Gelidite necromancer controlled Sir Tremblant, who pleaded for death
      even as he was magically forced to defend his evil master.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When Tremblant was released from his misery
      and Frisirth defeated, the parties confronted a greater mystery -- a
      large, rotating crystal the Gelidites called the Great Work. This magical
      artifact had been discovered by Frisirth centuries before. Under the
      enchantments of the Gelidites, the Great Work sucked the heat from the
      earth, causing the snows that carpeted Dereth. When the explorers rushed
      to destroy it, the crystal defended itself with powerful magics. Many were
      slain, but in the end the Isparians prevailed. Abrim of Morningthaw
      chronicled the final battle against the Work in his tale “Return to
      Frore,” which became a bestseller at the capital towns of Cragstone,
      Hebian-To, and Zaikhal.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the Great Work shattered, warmth began
      to seep back into the land. The exhausted and battered adventurers
      returned to their homes, to enjoy the blessings of the Solstice, Festival
      of Lights, and Night Feast holidays. During the celebrations, new culinary
      delights had been invented to delight the palate. Kakori of Thistledown
      made Carrot Cake, Dani the Crazed of Leafcull introduced Famous Pizza,
      Raszagal and Tassadar of Morningthaw created Hot Kimchi, and Firedemon of
      Thistledown baked the first Spiced Apple Pie. Bortin of Frostfell created
      Fruitcake, but he has since been forgiven, and is occasionally allowed
      back into town.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The remnants of the Gelidite cult were left
      in sorrow, their great hopes dashed. Departing adventurers even seized
      their ancient scriptures as spoils of war. <i>Our Great Work</i>, a memoir
      written by Ferundi, was given to the scholars of Hebian-To, and the
      ancient <i>Book of Minesh</i>, a history of the Gelidite cult, was seized
      by the Zaikhal Arcanum.</font>

      / Earth: January 2000</b></span><br>
      As the heat seeped back into the earth, snowlines receded. Patches of
      slush still dotted the landscape, but hints of green returned to most of
      the land. All was not well, however.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The enigmatic Shadow creatures began to
      walk the landscape openly, harassing adventurers and making travel through
      remote areas a dangerous proposition. In addition, floating Crystal
      Fragments appeared. While originally thought to be pieces of the Gelidites'
      Great Work, the vast numbers of Fragments that soon swarmed across Dereth
      seemed to imply another origin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately, the most learned mages of the
      land had taken to heart the dire prognostications of the recovered
      Gelidite scriptures. The Archmages Celdiseth, Fadsahil al-Tashbi,
      Nuhmudira, and Shoyanen Kenchu offered for sale Master Mage Robes of fine
      quality, while they allowed their Apprentice Mage Robes to be sold by the
      local mages of various towns.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Non-mages were not left without fashionable
      attire, however, as the traditional warrior garb of Ispar began to appear
      in Dereth. Celdon, Amullian, and Koujia Armor became visible signs of a
      warrior's prowess.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><span lang="en-us">Shadows of the Past
      </span></b><span lang="en-us">(from the

      / Earth: February 2000</b></span><br>
      Providence smiled upon the refugee nations of Ispar in the month of
      Coldeve. Rumors sprang up of ancient storage vaults hidden across the
      length and breadth of Dereth. Bold parties sought these lost facilities
      out, and discovered the fragments of weapons used in the last war with the
      Shadows, some two thousand years before humans first arrived in this land.
      These were designed ages ago by alchemist and warrior Lord Atlan, and his
      wife, the enchanter Lady Maila. While the contributions of both were
      apparently vital to winning the last war, the documentation recovered
      suggests both died in the conflict -- hardly a reassuring statistic.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Atlan artifacts were a set of melee
      weapons -- swords, daggers, maces, and so on -- fashioned from raw pyreal
      motes. Any one of a number of special, magical gemstones could be imbedded
      in a weapon to imbue it with a particular elemental power, and by means of
      a special stone tool, each gemstone could be exchanged for another of a
      different power. Thus, for example, a frosting axe could be turned into a
      lightning axe. While pyreal motes could be recovered from any type of
      golem, the stones and the tool were securely stored in several remote and
      dangerous dungeons. One of these was defended by legions of powerful
      undead, one by fire elementals and magma golems, one by never-before-seen
      lightning elementals, and one by a band of Tumeroks. A final vault, named
      Incunabula, had been infested with Olthoi, who transformed it into the
      most deadly hive known to exist in Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps in response to the discovery of
      these weapons, the Shadows that had made overland travel a terrifying
      prospect melted away into the night. Very few remained under open skies,
      although this made some more nervous than relieved. New rumors abounded in
      taverns that some dark force was biding its time for a major assault.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many powerful monarchs were whisked away to
      a remote island, said to lie to the southwest of Dereth. Here they were
      challenged by a dark presence to run a gauntlet filled with bizarre
      monsters. While most lost their sense of direction, or were slain by the
      gauntlet's fierce inhabitants, two of the most dangerous fiends in Dereth
      survived the trial: Blackthorn and Vidorian of Thistledown. They were
      rewarded with corrupted Shadow Stones, which could be fitted into the
      Atlan weapons. These stones gave a weapon tremendous power . . . though
      their use seemed to drain the will and sense of self from the weapon's
      wielder. It remained to be seen what the two so-called “Dark Masters”
      would be called upon to do. Fafhrd of Thistledown and Killean of
      Morningthaw made a heroic decision to defy the gathering evil, and refused
      to take the dark presence's test. Their selfless denial of easy power
      would be remembered in the days ahead.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hand of darkness also sought allies
      using means as subtle as the monarch kidnappings were gross. Hamud ibn
      Rafik, leader of an extremist sect of the Gharu'ndim Zharalim called the
      Tenebrous Edge, made his presence known in Dereth. He and his daughter
      Devana sent many adventurers on a test of their own. Success earned a
      magnificent Pyreal Katar that pulsed with dark power, trailing streamers
      of sooty mist. Rumor held that Rafik had lost his mind taking to heart
      Archephoros' maxim that to fight darkness, sometimes one must become a
      shadow.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the opposite edge of the A'mun desert,
      Dizah ibn Nadqab began excavating a massive crypt complex built beneath an
      ancient fortress near Zaikhal. He apparently ventured where he shouldn't
      have, and the ancient dead of the Impious Temple reawakened, chasing him
      out of the complex. In exchange for funds to continue his research, he let
      the bold enter the Temple. A shattered staff, apparently unusable, was
      discovered in its depths. Fortunately, some adventurers managed to find
      someone wise enough to repair it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all the news was worrisome. The land
      continued to recover from the damage wrought by the Great Work of the
      Gelidites. Flowers blossomed all over Osteth, filling the air with
      drifting clouds of pollen. Rabbits, delighted by the return of warm
      weather, quickly did as rabbits are wont to do, resulting in a veritable
      plague of baby bunnies on the landscape, which nibbled crops and tripped
      inattentive travelers. Most were harmless irritants, but tales of more
      dangerous bunnies trickled out of the Direlands . . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meantime, the excavations of over twenty
      Meeting Halls that dated from the Empyrean Era of Lore were completed near
      the major towns of Dereth. These underground amphitheaters are thought to
      have been built for assemblies of nobles and scholars, or for the
      briefings of local troop garrisons. Allegiances across Dereth soon began
      holding their meetings in these structures. In other local news, Guthima
      the Wise, archmage of Arwic, moved down the road. Complaints from
      neighbors about crowds of mages practicing their craft all hours of the
      night convinced the town's nobility to build a new shop for him outside of
      town.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, as if in omen, the beginning of the
      month saw a titanic bridge, carved from dark volcanic glass, appear over
      the River Prosper between Holtburg, Cragstone, and Arwic. Formerly cloaked
      by the lost magical arts of the Empyrean, the Obsidian Span drew crowds of
      gawkers. Not a few mad souls actually jumped off of it. Sages could only
      speculate what other structures might lie in the open without our knowing.</font>

      11 / Earth: March 2000</b></span><br>
      The festive spring atmosphere of flowers, bees, and marriage ceremonies
      was disturbed by a series of earthquakes that preceded the eruption of
      bizarre Shadow Spires across the face of Dereth. These enormous
      constructions burst from the ground near the towns of Khayyaban, Tufa,
      Sawato, Tou-Tou, Cragstone, and Eastham. Travelers reported seeing Spires
      in the deep wilderness as well. Sages claimed they were somehow alive, but
      little could be proven, for no way could be found to enter them. Though
      brooding and malevolent-looking, the Spires floated harmlessly over the
      land for many days. Then came the abductions.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many adventurers reported being magically
      pulled into the Spires, and subjected to a battery of questions by three
      invisible presences, each distinguished by the tone of its questions. Some
      of these questions were quite unfathomable, referring to people and events
      not yet familiar to humanity in Dereth. Most shocking, however, was the
      final question: Which of the six towns visited by the Spires should be
      destroyed? Some of the abducted answered with a random town, in fear of
      the power shown by the unseen presence; others chose a specific town out
      of spite. A few refused to choose. All were returned uninjured.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the month progressed, disturbing changes
      were wrought in the heavens. The sun shrank, turning a dim, bloody red.
      The dark clouds faded to a sulfurous tint during storms. The moons of
      Alb'arel and Rez'arel swelled to grotesque size, and some feared they were
      falling. Through it all, the form of a demon lurked along the northern
      horizon, visible only during the most violent tempests.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the face of what seemed to be an
      impending catastrophe, the people of Dereth worked feverishly to prepare
      their defenses. Many sought the ancient weapons of Atlan that had been
      recovered the previous month. Studying the Atlan weapons and referencing
      clues in ancient texts, the Master Smiths Jibril ibn Rashid, Koga Hideki,
      and Alean the Steel Forger managed to create suits of Shadowhunter Armor
      from the gems and shards taken from Shadows and Crystal Fragments. Those
      who brought them these hard-to-recover trophies could have them fashioned
      into this exquisite mail.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the month, an expectant
      silence hung over Dereth, broken only by the howl of the Spires and the
      frantic hammering of the Master Smiths. Ground tremors struck the island,
      as if something within the earth was stirring . . .</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="History2.htm">Continued</a></font></td>
