    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It was amazing and 
    terrifying. The entire quest and how it works with only a fellow was 
    unbelievable. Terrifying, because I was the first one that took the debuffs 
    from the eyes. Seeing all my stats drop by 99% gave me a bit of a heart 
    attack, luckily the rest of my group kept the boss off of me. At the end, 
    the other strange devices draining life from me, I thought that was weird, 
    but didn’t think much about it; I was still amazed at the quest and the 
    rewards.</span></font></p>

    <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I was currently buffing at 
    Fort Tethena with my noob mage. I was planning to head to the Tusker Pits 
    for an uneventful night of leveling. While I was buffing, I alt-tabbed out 
    of the game to read the VN boards. When I came back, I decided to scroll up 
    and see if I missed anything important in the allegiance chat. Normally I 
    just check for any @tells that came my way. In the allegiance chat, 
    Ax’Sassin was looking for me, asking me to @tell him asap, because it was 
    important. Ax told me some weird guy, with a weird name, in weird armor was 
    looking for me. He gave me the name without knowing who this Antius 
    Blackmoor was. At first, I did not remember the name and though it was 
    someone asking if I could help lead a Blackmire Quest. So I contacted him, 
    in which he informed me to get on Rage Lao. So I did.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

    meet in the Marketplace, at that point he came across with a tell like (OOC:…) 
    basically saying he wanted someplace more quiet. At first, I didn’t realize 
    was OOC meant( it means Out of Character, just for future reference if you 
    didn’t know ;) ). When I got there, I started to put 2 and 2 together and it 
    turned on like a light bulb. </span></font></p>

    blame yourself?</span></font></b></p>

    post somewhere along the line. If I ended up bringing doom to Dereth, well, 
    please don’t kill me. However, if I saved it, praise me as a king. Several
