&nbsp;</font></span><div>
			<font face="Arial">Hey folks! Got quite a bit of news this week, but 
			let’s start off with another status update. Remember last week when 
			I said we were slightly ahead of schedule for our next milestone? 
			Well it’s a good thing that we were – we had networking issues for 
			most of last week that put a serious crimp in getting work done. The 
			issues were resolved by Monday of this week and we’re back on track.<br>
			<br>
			During Tuesday’s scheduled maintenance, we made an upgrade to the 
			Turbine Billing website to support the Throne of Destiny Preview. If 
			you log in to Turbine Billing, you’ll notice that there is now an 
			option to subscribe to the Preview. Obviously you can’t do this 
			until we release the Preview Keys, but I wanted to note that from a 
			Billing perspective, we are good to go.<br>
			<br>
			One question that came up based on last week’s update was exactly 
			when we were going to be copying the Leafcull database to the 
			Preview world. I checked into it and the copy was done about a week 
			and a half ago. Those of you who were planning on rerolling on 
			Leafcull and power-leveling, don’t worry, we are going to make sure 
			you have the opportunity to get to high levels quickly in the 
			Preview so that you can check out the new high-end content.<br>
			<br>
			As most of you know, last week was also the gigantic industry 
			convention E3. While Turbine didn’t specifically show Throne of 
			Destiny at E3, we were able to get interviews scheduled with 
			Crossroads of Dereth WarCry and the Asheron’s Call Vault, both of 
			which should be posted as of the time you read this.<br>
			<br>
			In addition, from my point of view the number of people who spoke 
			fondly about their time playing Asheron’s Call was really quite 
			remarkable. In between my other tasks at E3 I talked up Throne of 
			Destiny to everyone who would listen, and the response was very 
			positive.<br>
			<br>
			Now let’s talk about some other AC:TD details that you may have seen 
			in the two interviews.<br>
			<br>
			First I want to make clear that we are committed to the return of 
			regular content updates through Events. What this means is that we 
			are pushing back our previous plans to release an Elder Game through 
			a Booster Pack for AC:TD subscribers. We still very much want to add 
			in a new game system similar to the one initially described, but 
			we’re delaying the release of this system. Our top priority after 
			Throne of Destiny launches is ongoing content updates and the next 
			story arc – once we’ve done what we want on that topic, we can 
			revisit the Elder Game design.<br>
			<br>
			Next, let’s take a look at the various methods you can use to get 
			the new client and data files, and the differences between them. As 
			we’ve said, once Throne of Destiny goes live on July 18, all players 
			will need to upgrade in order to access the game. This is due to the 
			vast changes that we’ve made to the format of our game data. So, how 
			do you get this upgrade?<br>
			<br>
			• Buy Throne of Destiny. If you buy the AC:TD box and install the 
			game, you’re good to go. There may be a launch day update but it 
			will be handled through the standard patching system and shouldn’t 
			be much larger than a monthly event.<br>
			<br>
			• Download the new client. Any player will be able to download the 
			new client off of Turbine’s website prior to AC:TD’s launch. That 
			way any player who is not planning on buying AC:TD, or who won’t be 
			able to get their hands on the box until a day or two after launch, 
			will be able to have the new client installed and ready for launch 
			day. We expect that this download will be between 300MB and 400MB. 
			As with the retail box client, there may be a small launch day 
			update.<br>
			<br>
			• Download the Preview client. That’s right! Under our current 
			plans, players who download the Preview client during our Open 
			Preview in late June won’t need to install anything new for launch 
			day. As with the other methods, there may be a small launch day 
			update.<br>
			<br>
			We’ve spent quite a bit of effort ensuring that these three 
			different methods all get you the same thing – the new AC:TD client 
			and data files. We want folks to have as many options as possible to 
			get the new client and get in-game on launch day! Obviously, the 
			recommended method is to buy the AC:TD retail box.<br>
			<br>
			So, if all three versions are the same, does that mean that even 
			non-AC:TD subscribers get the full benefits of the graphics update? 
			Almost. All players get access to the new graphics engine and its 
			features as well as upgraded textures. <br>
			<br>
			However, as part of a content update soon after the AC:TD launch, we 
			will be unlocking a set of even more detailed textures for Throne of 
			Destiny subscribers only. <br>
			<br>
			As noted in the AC Vault interview, this set of “Very High” 
			resolution textures were originally intended to be part of the AC:TD 
			launch. However due to a bug they were never properly tested. Then, 
			as we were testing the game, we realized that the gorgeous new 
			graphics we were looking at for the game were actually not the 
			highest resolution version! We’d been looking at the “High” 
			resolution textures, which were so incredible that we believed we 
			were looking at the “Very High” resolution textures.<br>
			<br>
			So, initially AC:TD and non-AC:TD subscribers will see the exact 
			same graphics after the launch. The Very High res textures will be 
			unlocked as part of a regular content update shortly after the 
			launch, and will be AC:TD-only, along with the new Islands, the 
			ability to find and use Rare items, and all the other features of 
			AC:TD. <br>
			<br>
			So that’s the news. As I said above, despite the networking issues 
			last week we’re still on track for Preview in late June and launch 
			on July 18. Exciting days are approaching!</font></div>
