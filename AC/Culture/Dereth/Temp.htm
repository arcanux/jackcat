    Letter to the Players </font></span></b>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Welcome to the September 2003 Letter to 
    the Players. There are three main topics I’d like to address, so let’s get 
    right to it!</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Event News</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the last several months, we’ve been 
    sending out information on upcoming events in three separate documents: the 
    Letter to the Players, the Teaser, and the Dev Notes. Starting this month, 
    you’ll also be seeing a return of the Rollout Article.&nbsp; Here’s how these 
    four break down:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Letter to the Players, which you’re 
      reading now, will be used for hot-button topics that we want to inform you 
      of prior to patch day. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Teaser won’t change—it will still be a 
      story progressing and teasing the ongoing plot. In addition, you’ll 
      continue to see pictures of upcoming content. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Rollout Article, you’ll see 
      features that we used to discuss in the Letter to the Players and the Dev 
      Notes. Any item in the Dev Notes that deserves more in-depth explanation, 
      but not necessarily advance notice, will go in here. This is also the new 
      home of the story snippet that used to be at the beginning of the Dev 
      Notes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Other than moving the story paragraph to 
      the Rollout Article, the Dev Notes won’t change. This will still be a 
      point-by-point list of updates to the game.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to these four documents, we’ll 
    still be doing the Developer Diaries, plus other articles when we have 
    special topics to discuss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Dupe Bans and the Hall of Shame</b> </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As was announced, our initial sweep through 
    the dupe logs turned up a number of names. We banned these players and 
    shamed their characters publicly. Since then, we have continued our search 
    through the logs, and have banned several additional players.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of these players contacted us and 
    explained themselves. They stated that the duplication was unintentional, 
    and described exactly what had happened. We compared their stories to our 
    logs…and the stories matched. These players have since been unbanned and we 
    would like to apologize to them. Their information will help us weed out 
    future mistakes. However, in light of this incident, we are instituting two 
    new policies:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you experience a bug or server hiccup 
      and accidentally duplicate items, please hand them to a Town Crier 
      immediately.&nbsp; Then send an email to <a href="mailto:accmty@microsoft.com">
      accmty@microsoft.com</a> reporting what happened.&nbsp; Please include your 
      account name.&nbsp; This will allow us to track down any remaining dupe bugs 
      and assist us in distinguishing intentional duplication from accidental 
      duplication. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We will no longer be listing account or 
      character names on the Hall of Shame.&nbsp; Bans can be appealed—everyone makes 
      mistakes sometimes.&nbsp; Dragging players’ names through the mud may be 
      effective, but we feel it’s unnecessarily cruel. Therefore, the Hall of 
      Shame will be updated with the number of accounts banned on each server, 
      but not the specific names. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first bullet point above will also be 
    added to the character select screen in the September event, to ensure that 
    players do not miss it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Keep Your Heads Down</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We couldn’t let a whole Letter go by without 
    mentioning game content, could we?&nbsp; Well, here’s some advice, from me to 
    you...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The last time you log out before the 
    September event, make sure you log out somewhere safe.&nbsp; I recommend towns, 
    mansions, housing settlements or residential quarters.&nbsp; Those digging noises 
    are back... and they’re getting louder…</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">See you in Dereth!</font></p>
