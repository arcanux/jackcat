      PY 11 / Earth: October 2000</font></b></span>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The night skies cleared. Stars flickered to
      life in the void. The glowering volcanic face of Rez'arel and pale,
      mysterious Alb'arel rose again along their courses. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Humanity began to rebuild after the violence
      of the previous month, even as the Shadow Spires that had wrought the
      destruction began to dig themselves back into the earth from whence they'd
      come. In Arwic, the Environmental Defense League respectfully buried the
      smoldering remains of the town's beloved heifer, Sally. In Tufa, the
      residents stoically rebuilt their shops on ledges round the rim of the
      crater.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tufa's scribe left to join Fazyad ibn
      Raymar's expedition into the cool grottos of Xarabydun. Explorers had
      recently discovered this network of caves under the sands between Al-Arqas
      and Khayyaban. The facility was a former Empyrean archive, and the
      scholars of Zaikhal carted thousands of books out of the lower caves for
      study. The first fruits of their research were the so-called “peas,” a
      Yalaini method of storing magic reagents in compact form. Ibn Raymar's
      party colonized the upper caves, though the lower regions remained dark
      and overrun by creatures. Rumor held that a valuable aid to enchanters
      could be found in the lower tunnels, but the entrance was magically
      forbidden to the elite of Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the Shadows remained quiet, other
      races hostile to humanity were not. Explorers venturing into the rugged
      Linvak Mountains were stunned to find an enormous fortress under
      construction by the Lugians. Some mages feared that its massive walls must
      be made of chorizite, and began wailing to their respective gods that the
      structure be struck down by one of the increasingly rare shooting stars.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Candeth Martine, an explorer of the
      Dereth Exploration Society, disappeared into the Blackmire Swamp on a
      mission to study the habits of mosswarts. Would-be rescuers discerned that
      a rival tribe of banderlings had evicted Martine's band. The trail of the
      refugees was followed as far west as Uziz. Unfortunately, Sir Martine
      seemed to have been abducted by some other group at that point, for only
      his journal was found among the mosswarts. By the end of the month, no
      further clues to his location had been found.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Direlands, portals to a “Floating
      City” began to appear and disappear at random. This structure,
      constructed within the wilds of portalspace, drifted wantonly through that
      strange violet-lit realm. Notes dropped throughout the massive structure
      proved that at least one Isparian, bombastic explorer Alatar Locke, had
      previously wandered the dusty corridors. He opined that the city had been
      built at the height of the Seaborne Empire of Yalain, when portal magic
      was “in vogue.” In time, its enchantments lost their potency. The city
      was cast adrift, fading in and out of contact with the world of Auberean
      over the millennia.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps in response to the disquieting news
      coming from all quarters of Dereth, a festive atmosphere infected the
      towns. On Ispar, Harvestgain was, naturally enough, the month of harvest.
      Perhaps because of the abundance of scarecrows back home, some of the
      homely straw men found their way through the vagaries of portalspace. Some
      people reported animate scarecrows harassing travelers, but no reliable
      witnesses could be found. These tales were dismissed as the work of those
      kegs rolled out for the harvest festival.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was unexpected benefit to the arrival
      of the scarecrows, however. In their empty heads were seeds allowing
      Isparian pumpkins to be grown in Dereth. The traditional autumn foods of
      pumpkin soup and pie soon graced dinner tables. In keeping with Aluvian
      custom, some of the pulpy round fruits had demonic faces carved into them.
      Superstition held that these faces would ward off evil. The Shadows did
      not seem overly impressed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After months of work, the largely ignored
      tailors of Dereth began to sell exquisitely designed dresses, ensuring
      that they would occasionally be able to feed their families. One
      enterprising Aluvian leather crafter decided to alter her Kireth gown to
      allow a bit more . . . ventilation. She offered her skills as a seamstress
      to others at no charge. To her considerable surprise, she found herself
      beset both by conservatives, who claimed that the cut of the dress would
      adversely affect the moral fortitude of Isparians, and liberals, who
      claimed the cut of the dress denigrated the Aluvian goddess-trinity and
      Queen Elysa Strathelar.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The master crafters Alexander the Deft,
      Janda Sulifiya, and Tsua Kagemata offered to create masks from the heads
      of banderlings, skeletons, drudges, tuskers, and mosswarts. To the alarm
      of Ayan Baqur's residents, a second Virindi, calling itself Leopold,
      floated into town one afternoon. It drifted aimlessly around the town,
      closely observing the passers-by and asking many questions. Leopold, as it
      turned out, was also a mask-maker. . . of sorts.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Leopold was hardly the most worrisome
      Virindi of the month. The underground redoubts of Sotiris and Tumideon
      were discovered in the wastes of the Obsidian Plain. In those inhospitable
      halls, the enigmatic Virindi had created “Hollow Minions.” These
      artificial life forms vaguely resembled scarecrows, but were animated with
      malicious intent and partially constructed from chorizite ore. They proved
      highly resistant to magic, and could punch through magical armors with
      their hollow fists.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A final ill wind blew through the Direlands
      during Harvestgain. In a small cave by the coast, one of Dereth's most
      benign creatures acquired a hideous strength, heretofore unseen in the
      world. The time of the white rabbit (affectionate dubbed “Pookie,” by
      some) had come . . . and the bodies began to pile up like cordwood.</font>
