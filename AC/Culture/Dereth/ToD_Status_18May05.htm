			<font face="Arial">Hi folks! It’s been a few weeks since our last 
			update, and there’s a lot of exciting news that I want to tell you 
			about. <br>
			<br>
			First off, you’ll be seeing updates like this much more frequently. 
			Once a week I’ll be posting a status update with news about where we 
			are in the launch process as well as any other news, and possibly 
			even some guest entries from other members of the team!<br>
			<br>
			Speaking of the team, many of you have asked who is running <i>
			Throne of Destiny</i> development since Jessica Mulligan’s 
			departure. Now is a good time to introduce (or re-introduce) the 
			folks who are in charge.<br>
			<br>
			When we needed someone to take point on <i>Throne of Destiny</i> 
			development, someone with the experience to keep us on track and 
			oversee things at the executive level, Chris Dyl, Turbine’s Chief 
			Technology Officer, stepped up to the opportunity. Chris has been 
			with Turbine for over ten years, was a lead developer on the 
			original Asheron’s Call, and knows our technology as well as anyone 
			on the planet, which means that he can look at our bug-fixing 
			schedule and time estimates and make sure they’re realistic. He also 
			can make sure that everything is humming along with regards to our 
			publishing partners and our operations folk back east. <br>
			<br>
			We also have two Producers on <i>Throne of Destiny</i> right now, 
			each of whom play a slightly different role on the team. One is a 
			name you’ll recognize: Srand. She is in charge of design decisions 
			and the overall vision of the game. She’ll be continuing in this 
			role on the Live Team after launch, and has already begun the 
			scheduling and design process for the future. The other good news is 
			that this means that I can hand my Acting Producer duties back over 
			to her and spend more time on my primary role – communicating with 
			you.<br>
			<br>
			Our second Producer was brought on as the Santa Monica Quality 
			Assurance Coordinator, and has done such a great job at keeping us 
			in line that we’ve appointed him as Producer. His name is Darren 
			Manes and he came to us from EA, where he worked on a number of MMOs 
			such as Ultima Online and The Sims Online. Last month when we were 
			looking at our schedule and all of the things we needed to get done 
			before launch, Darren was the one who spoke up and made sure that we 
			all understood that we had to choose between meeting our old date 
			and shipping a quality product. We all bow before the power of his 
			calendar.<br>
			<br>
			So where are we on that calendar now? We’re right on track for our 
			July 18 launch. On Friday we hit one of our internal deadlines, and 
			we’re actually slightly ahead of schedule for the next one. (No, 
			this doesn’t mean we might be able to launch early.) <br>
			<br>
			With these three at the helm, we are in good hands and are on track. 
			This brings us to the next step: Preview.<br>
			<br>
			I’m sure you want to know exactly what you have to do in order to 
			see the game before it ships. How exactly will we be determining who 
			gets access to the Preview? I think we’ve found an excellent method 
			to ensure fairness: <i>Everyone has the opportunity to get in.</i><br>
			<br>
			At the end of June we will be launching an Open Preview for Throne 
			of Destiny. Everyone will be able to download the AC:TD client, and 
			we’ll be releasing the Preview Keys in batches through FilePlanet, 
			with no restrictions on who can get a Key. We’ll be copying all 
			character data from one of the existing game worlds (we rolled a die 
			and it looks like it’ll be Leafcull) so that many of you will have 
			existing characters to use when trying out the new content and 
			systems. For the rest of you, we’ve got a few ideas that we’re 
			working on to help you check out what AC:TD has to offer for all of 
			your characters. <br>
			<br>
			Another topic that many folks in the community have been asking 
			about (well “asking” is probably too weak a word here, but I’ll use 
			it anyways) is Throne of Destiny distribution outside of the US and 
			Europe. <br>
			<br>
			Over the last two months, we’ve been working to close a deal with a 
			distributor who would be able to market to folks in Australia, South 
			America and elsewhere. While we were in the midst of these 
			negotiations, we couldn’t talk about them – no, not even to say, 
			“Yes, we’re working on it.”<br>
			<br>
			Unfortunately we were not able to close a deal that was to the 
			satisfaction of all parties, so I have to tell those of you outside 
			the US and Europe that there will not be local distribution of AC:TD 
			for your regions. Your best bet at buying AC:TD or the pre-order box 
			is to buy from a US or European retail outlet that will ship the 
			game to you.<br>
			<br>
			We do plan on marketing AC:TD via digital distribution at a later 
			date, once the traditional retailers have had 3-6 months or so to 
			sell the game. The digital AC:TD package will not include the 
			pre-order box bonus items, however.<br>
			<br>
			I know this is disappointing news, particularly during the silence 
			on this topic that was required during the negotiation phase. We 
			wanted very much to provide retail distribution for these areas, but 
			unfortunately we simply couldn’t make the numbers work.<br>
			<br>
			As many of you know, this week is E3, the huge electronics 
			entertainment industry convention in Los Angeles. Turbine will be 
			there, and we’d love it if any of you who are at E3 wanted to swing 
			by our booth and check out <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</i> and <i>
			The Lord of the Rings Online</i>. Our booth is right next to Sony 
			and Nintendo in the West Hall, across from a concession stand. The 
			booth number is 2666 – don’t ask who we had to talk to in order to 
			get that location! In addition to the coverage of Turbine’s upcoming 
			games, I have interviews scheduled with some of our Asheron’s Call 
			fan sites, so look for those next weekend or early next week. Both 
			Calandryll and I will be at E3 and would love to talk about Throne 
			of Destiny if you can grab us. Turbine will also have a webcam in 
			our booth, watch
