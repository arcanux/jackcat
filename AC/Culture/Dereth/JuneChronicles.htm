    During the month of Seedsow PY 13 (June, 2002), High Queen Elysa Strathelar 
    called her people a second time, this time to the Frostfell Festival Stone. 
    There she continued the ceremony of lighting the Festival Stones and 
    conveyed important information to her subjects about the state of the world.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>High Queen Elysa Strathelar calls the 
    people of Dereth to the Frostfell Festival Stone.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asheron says, </b>“This festival stone, 
    the second dedicated to the people of Dereth, signifies the bonds that you 
    have made and your unity.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It lights now for the houses of Dereth!”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Elysa smiles broadly to the people.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Elysa says, </b>“We live in a time of 
    adversity, a time that is filled with strife and sorrow at every corner.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Through it all we stand united in the common 
    cause of making our home a place that is secure for future generations.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Here we make our peace. Here we recognize 
    the unity of the houses of Dereth, those joined by blood and those bound by 
    oath alone.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asheron says, </b>“This stone shall 
    signify that unity and those bonds. It shall be a beacon for the wayward and 
    the lost. It shall be the light in the darkness.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Elysa raises her hands.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Elysa says, </b>“Derethians. We must speak 
    now of the matter at hand. We are faced with a most frightening foe. One who 
    once was like us.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Candeth Martine was once one of us. He came 
    from Ispar like all of you and adventured across these lands as a member of 
    the Explorer Society.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“This same group has grown to become an 
    offshoot of both my own Royal Guard and the Arcanum.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“But he was lost to us, taken by the Virindi.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Elysa pauses and scans the crowd for 
    reactions.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Elysa says, </b>“Asheron has returned to 
    help us stop the atrocities that Martine has begun. We have seen the 
    destruction that has been wrought upon the world. “ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“At the Menhir, magic itself has revolted 
    against the natural order and destroyed the Essences.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“And though, with aid from Asheron, the 
    Arcanum has concentrated components necessary for the casting of magic, 
    mages have become concerned over oddities in workings of magic, a lessening 
    in its strength and power.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The world that we know here hangs in a 
    tenuous balance, an order that must be maintained. That order has until now 
    remained untouched, in balance, complete.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“But now it is threatened.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asheron says, </b>“The balance Elysa 
    speaks of was threatened only once before, in a time not documented well by 
    my people.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It was a time when war spread across this 
    world, and the victors consumed and destroyed the history of the conquered.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“My ancestors were the victors and the 
    civilization of the Gelid dissolved.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Gelid hid well for a time but a group 
    amongst them. . . broke free. They were eventually slain, as you may have 
    learned, but they left a mark upon the world.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“These marks remain in the form of 
    Elementals, beings created from the very essence of magic itself, given form 
    and sentience by those that once commanded them.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The goals and machinations of this offshoot 
    coalition were thwarted by the Gelid of Frore.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Their tomes and halls were lost to time, 
    hidden from even my sight beneath the weight of a history written by victors 
    who did not wish these secrets known.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“When my people held this land, no one 
    studied the arts of elemental control.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Elementals were assailants even then, 
    but they were. . . less aggressive. In time they became tools of the undead, 
    the Dericost, who have roots that stretch back to a history that we are all 
    better off forgetting, lest we let their power grow anew.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Asheron sighs heavily.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asheron says, </b>“But I fear that over 
    time even the greatest magic fails if not fueled. It is by this avenue that 
    I fear Martine came by his knowledge.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“He duped Nuhmudira into aiding him in his 
    acquisition of raw power, in the collection of the invisible rivers' power, 
    tapping into what you call ley lines.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The essences' destruction was the first of 
    much to come. What Martine has set in motion. . . is beyond even my capacity 
    to fully understand.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Magic in its rawest form is unpredictable. 
    It is only through temperance and understanding that we can give it the 
    forms of defense, enhancement and destruction.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Asheron looks to Elysa.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Asheron says, </b>“We must all band 
    together and stave off his hand. Stop him, before the actions that he has 
    begun have irreversible consequences.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“To that end, I will be assisting Elysa and 
    the Arcanum in researching the way to curb Martine's plans.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Elysa nods to Asheron and then turns her 
    attention back to the crowd.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Elysa says, </b>“We will not fail, my 
    people. We shall succeed as we have so many times before when facing a foe 
    bent upon our demise. This world is ours now.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We shall not stand by and see it ruined.”
    </font></p>

    the course of this cycle of the moons, and in that time, much more will be

    During the month of Seedsow PY 13 (June, 2002), High Queen Elysa Strathelar 
    called her people a final time, this time to the Midsong Festival Stone. The 
    Queen had been holding these ceremonies with her subjects to symbolize that 
    Dereth now truly was their home and that they were its people. Many of these 
    ceremonies were interrupted, either by the deranged Martine or by disturbing 
    discoveries. Now in holding this final ceremony, Queen Elysa hoped to end 
    these ceremonies by bringing hope to the hearts of her people. 
    Unfortunately, a shocking attack brings the people anything but hope. </font>

    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Martine says, </b>“Yes.” </font></p>
