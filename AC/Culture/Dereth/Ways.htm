      <img src="Ways/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="178"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ardry sat by the campfire, nursing a cup of
      hot cocoa. Though trying to rest, he kept his back to the fire and his
      eyes watchful of the surrounding darkness. Closer by the fire sat his
      uncle, Aliester the Loquacious, binding arrowheads into neat bundles.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“There,” Aliester announced, “done
      with the last of the wrapping. Mark my words, Ardry, you'll be glad of
      this once we've journeyed into the Direlands, miles away from the nearest
      portal and any source of ammunition. Now for my alchemical supplies. .
      .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hush, uncle, I think there's something
      out there. . .” Ardry, suddenly alert, took up his axe.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Heedless, the old scholar continued to
      prattle on. “I must say, I've done an admirable job of fletching. Maybe
      I ought to submit an application to Eluard, eh? Who says a scholar cannot
      be skilled in the arts of battlefield support?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'd rather not have to deal with Eluard,
      uncle. He's a pompous windbag, at best. Where does he get off, with this
      pretentious guild of his?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ardry, I think that Eluard's work--
      Great good heavens!” Aliester yelped and dropped his bundle as he was
      engulfed in an Ash Gromnie's blast of lightning. Ardry leaped to his feet,
      axe ready, and quickly killed the beast. That done, he went to check on
      his uncle, who looked singed and dazed, but otherwise still alive.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Uncle! Are you all right?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The old sage blinked, then looked up.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Unbelievable, uncle. How did you survive
      that blast?” Ardry leaned in for a closer look. Aliester's legs crackled
      with dissipated electricity. “Are those my chainmail leggings you're
      wearing?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With visible effort, Aliester gathered his
      wits. “Why, yes, they are. . . fit nicely, you see, quite comfortable. .
      .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ardry simply shook his head and muttered,
      “What luck you have, uncle.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Unlike any other gaming experience, the
      world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. Last month, not only did the
      new gambling halls open but so did Linvak Tukal, the impressive Lugian
      citadel and seat of the giants' power in Dereth. One can only wonder what
      additions -- and what dangers -- will be added when we soon open our May
      event, “</i>The Changing of the Ways.<i>”</i></font>

    </font>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">May 16, 2001</font>
      <p><img src="Sorrows/img_swords.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="152"><font face="Arial" size="2">Subject to the mercurial genius of
      craftsmen, mages and wanderlust heroes, few things persist in the lands of
      Dereth. While April witnessed the opening of Linvak Tukal and continued
      Virindi machinations, this month sees changes to the structure of the very
      world itself.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who consider the matter do not name
      their sword or shield as their most vital possession. Rather, they point
      to their pack, without which no treasure may be ported, nor reagents or
      potions carried at the ready. For Dereth's travelers, this month's
      improved efficiency of pack space comes as welcome news. Items may be
      stacked in greater quantities, and the Empyrean mana-alloy coins known as
      pyreals have begun to exhibit another miraculous trait -- they are now
      completely weightless!</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet in this world there are those who
      wander wide and those who remain to craft. Since recent events transpired,
      trade artists have toiled through the nights perfecting the fruits of
      their skill -- readying all of Dereth, perhaps, for future encounters with
      unfriendly forces. Smiths have forged lighter suits of plate, with better
      protection against the hostile elements. Mages have augmented the effects
      of many spells; certain magical enhancements now last longer, while
      burdensome counters evaporate more quickly. More efficient methods of
      creation and bundling have even been developed by fletchers and
      alchemists.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In all, adventurers can now fill their
      packs with more and greater items, whether created by master craftsmen or
      purchased in the new trading post en route to the Direlands.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, many who travel the fey byways
      of Dereth are far more than mere “adventurers.” There are those who
      wield the axe, the sword, even the mystic arts of spellcraft with the
      precision of a master. The opportunity is now at hand for them to claim
      long-deserved titles -- if only they can conclude their chosen path.
      Should such travelers happen to fall along the way, however, at least
      they'll be able to locate their corpse with far greater precision. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all
      changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town
      criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades
      of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and
      abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>Highlights include:</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players are now given the coordinates of
          their characters' corpses when they die, making retrieval a far less
          frustrating task.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New quests and adventures have been
          added, including the opportunity to choose a title more unique than
          “Adventurer.”</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new trading post has opened in the
          Direlands, offering an alternative to crowded Ayan Baqur.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pyreals became weightless! It seems that
          while Aluvian smiths cannot change the laws o' physics, greed can.
          Dereth is full of wonders.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Metal armors have improved weight, cost,
          and elemental protection.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stack sizes have been increased to at
          least 100. For arrows and quarrels, stack sizes are now 250.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Rebalancing continues. Undead, Mu-miyah,
          Sclavus, and low-level Shadows have had their casting abilities
          reduced to more sensible levels. Stat buff spells last longer, and
          skill and stat debuff spells burn off more quickly.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fletching and alchemy now have the
          equivalent of reagent peas!</font></li>

    </font><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stat buffs now last as long as skill buffs 
      of the same level. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All debuff spells have had their durations 
      halved. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fletching and alchemy “peas!” </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most bowyers will now sell at least basic 
      arrows, blunt arrows and broadhead arrows, as well as the wrapped (“pea”) 
      component equivalents. Most non-starter towns now sell arrows, blunt 
      arrows, frog crotch arrows, armor piercing arrows, as well as the wrapped 
      component equivalents. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Danby's Outpost has opened along the 
      northern coast of the Inland Sea. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Creatures who cast spells now have 
      particle and sound power-ups. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pyreals are now weightless! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stack sizes have been increased to at 
      least 100. For arrows and quarrels, stack sizes are now 250. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed the spell economy modifier from 
      Transfer, Fester, and Protection spells so they wouldn't be negative. 
      Instead of having a negative &quot;bonus,&quot; none will exist at all. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Metal armors now weigh 1/3rd less, have 
      1/3rd less value, and have had their elemental protections increased.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Crystal shield spells no longer interfere 
      with the Healing Mastery spells. They were using the same spell 
      categories, which caused Heal Mastery 6 to fail if the shield was equipped 
      and Warrior's Vitality was cast on you. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Arcane Restoration is no longer surpassed 
      by Mana Renewal Self 6. Same root cause as the issue above. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New scrolls have been added to the 
      treasure system. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Aerlinthe Repair Golem was always 
      supposed to wait until three hours after the death of RelicBonesPortal to 
      re-spawn. He never did. This was not a problem until the new ninety-minute 
      Keep generators were added -- people were able to get in again before the 
      previous spawn cycle had shut down. Result: players saw the spawn shut off 
      after ten minutes in the Keep. The Golem is now spawned after the spec'd 
      three hour interval. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Torches will now be housecleaned in a 
      matter of seconds when dropped on the ground. No more lag-inducing torch 
      spam. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is now a chance for a Tiny Shard at 
      the casinos in exchange for all pack toys. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Undead, Mu-miyah, and Sclavus have been 
      tweaked to make them more inline with their levels. </font></li>
    </ul>

    </font><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Item Enchantment skill icon is now a 
      hammer. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spear skill icon for chargen is now 
      included. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All bowyers now stock fletching supplies.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aqua Incanta now has a new icon that's 
      aqua blue, rather than white, to avoid confusion with Neutral Balms.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Victual Oil and Victual Infusions were 
      changed from green to brown (in the icons) and orange (in the setups) to 
      avoid confusion with acids, which are green. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Pack toys no longer decay when left on the 
      ground. Mr. Tusker won't run away looking for nanners anymore. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added the word &quot;add&quot; to the help text for
      <i>@permit</i>. The help text now correctly says: “@<i>permit add &lt;playername</i>&gt;”.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Screenshots are now numbered in a

      Serephina Folks the question takers will be announced in moments :)</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Auz Welcome Ladies and 
    Gentlemen to this month's developer chat with Turbine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Auz Again, thank you all for attending, and 
    now I'll hand you over to Azeraphel for the introductions :) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Azeraphel Hey, everyone. I'm Nik Davidson, 
    Producer for AC, here with my colorful cohorts; Allan &quot;Orion&quot; Maki, 
    community guru, Cardell Kerr, (who just kicked my butt at basketball,) Jesse 
    &quot;devilmouse&quot; Kurlancheek, and Sean &quot;One Man Art Studio&quot; Huxter... with more 
    possibly to arrive later on. Thanks to Auz and the Stratics folks for 
    hosting us tonight - and without further ado, let's get on with the chat.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Auz *Dennisg* Question: Is there any changes to the 
    Hieromancer Armor in this upcoming May Update? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    Azeraphel For the time being, the armor's &quot;done&quot;. Its charms seem to be 
    growing on people. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Xeveniah &lt;Achtung&gt; Are there any plans or 
    possibilities for more fixed outdoor monster spawns? The Lugian commander 
    areas are a huge blast - its like a 24/7 bar room brawl going on. Its an 
    interesting alternative than a dungeon with wall drainers and macroers. </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    Dell Actually, now that you mention it, it sounds like a good idea. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dell To be truthful, you stand a much larger 
    chance of seeing more outdoor spawns than other OHN's Dungeons that are over 
    crowded tend to be a large hit on server performance, so they are going to 
    be avoided in the future. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Auz *Archbow* Could the burden of books be lowered? 
    480 is a bit much, maybe 240? </b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    Dell Books... </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dell Okay, it is a bit large, considering 
    what they actually do for you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dell Punishing people for carrying lore on 
    them isn't really in our best interest, so we'll take a look at it. </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Auz *Xitel* Currently, I have to travel all the way 
    to Sawato to get blunt arrowheads. If mages were required to travel to only 
    Sawato to get orange tapers, I think there would be a huge outcry. We 
    archers have been patience enough. Give us our arrowheads! </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    devilmouse Quite quite -- &quot;very soon now&quot; you'll see loads of improvements 
    in this area. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">devilmouse I want fletching on my main again. 
    *sigh* </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">devilmouse availability up! useability up!
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Auz *CVeRiTy* Are there any plans to change the 
    &quot;You have jumped too recently&quot; message? I understand why this was done, but 
    it doesn't seem like a very practical solution. This has many negative 
    effects on the gameplay, especially when jumping is often used as part of a 
    challenge to a dungeon, but also as part of evading attacks. On a side note, 
    this was a most excellent patch. Thank you for the wonderful features you 
    added! </b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>
	</font> 
	<p class="MsoNormal">In the town of Eastham, a lone adventurer, Kullis, 
    approached the guild examiner. Kullis – his hardened fists his only weapons 
    – presented a completed puzzle. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>This, the examiner took and nodded.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Kullis 
    would enter the guild's annals, an unarmed brawler of unquestionable skill…</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">At the edge of the Direlands, a wandering merchant 
    continued his journey toward the rumored outpost so recently founded.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Let 
    others battle – Mordano bartered. Could prove good business, stocking up on 
    provisions at Danby's Outpost, selling them again to needful individuals 
    mired deep within the Dires. To make the initial investment, Mordano carried 
    a fair number of pyreal coins in his pack; yet such was the merchant's 
    greed, they seemed not to weigh at all…</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In Cragstone, in the empty second floor of a shop, the 
    alchemist Tessa crafted vials of acid infusions. With the new tools so 
    recently made available, she worked with greater speed, greater efficiency, 
    than she ever had before. The same work which once resulted in but one 
    infusion now produced fifty. Such were the wonders of her science…</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">And somewhere in the deserts of Middle Osteth, a 
    humbled warrior skulked and scurried along. Without his blade or even 
    breastplate any longer, Ecks Lee watched for those that sent him to the 
    Lifestone. He had arrived without many of his most vital possessions, but at 
    least with the knowledge of his former body's resting place. Ecks hurried 
    along – was it this rise or that where he'd met his end? And where lurked 
    the Grievvers that caused it?</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For all of Dereth, a new dawn brought with it 
    most unexpected – though decidedly welcome – changes. Crafts promised far 
    greater efficiency. The unfortunate, a quicker return to their fallen 
    bodies. And adventurers, the chance to avail themselves of truly fitting 
    titles… fitting, at least, for the worthiest among them.</font> </p>

    &quot;The Changing of the Ways,&quot; our latest AC event, opened the morning of May 
    16<sup>th</sup>. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>And with its arrival came much astonishment at how the ways 
    of the world have changed indeed.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps trade artists were the first to rejoice, as far 
    more efficient methods came to the skills of fletching and alchemy; wrapped 
    bundles now allow for the creation of multiple items at once rather than of 
    one item created multiple times. If the artists of Dereth were pleased, its 
    treasure hunters proved no less merry. Stack sizes have increased, freeing 
    more pack space for the ample collection of plunder; and among the treasures 
    to be gained, pyreals, coin of the realm, have become weightless (the trade 
    note markets continue to flourish, however, as they at least are not lost 
    upon death). Further information on the recent changes can be found on the
    <u>Crossroads of Dereth event page</u>.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Of all the changes taking place, the most personal must 
    surely be the chance for adventurers to gain a new title. Those with the 
    requisite skills, the ability to solve puzzles, and the blessing of the 
    Bestowers' Guild may apply for one of many titles -- from ballisteers, to 
    apothecaries, even crossbow snipers. Examiners await. The Handbook of the 
    Bestowers' Guild can be perused at <span class="head1" style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">

    AC Stratics has chosen its monarch of the month for May: Diamond of Leafcull! 
    When asked the most important job of any allegiance leader, Diamond had this 
    to say:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;To listen and give support. I don't mean be a parent 
    or anything. But to listen when (vassals) have a complaint of where to hunt 
    or what to do.... A monarch should know who to contact for the different 
    quests and such that are out there... and know when to get involved 
    directly. Not every quest is open for a monarch, but sometimes knowing who 
    can help them on that quest will be of more help than actually being there. 
    It all boils down to good communication.&quot;</p>
