    &quot;An Odd Wind Blows in the Direlands&quot;</font></p>
    <i><p></i><font face="Arial" size="2">June 1, 2000 </font></p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jena leaned heavily on a table in The Smoking Axe. The
    soothing, sea-blue light of the floor lamps utterly failed to improve her mood.
    &#147;Stout,&#148; she called to Berkholt, the barkeep. &#147;Lots of it. Keep it coming
    until I disappear under the table.&#148; Across from her, Hendac looked up from a watery
    bowl of what passed for stew in Ayan Baqur, and quirked an eyebrow at her. </font></i> </p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;It's bloody out there,&#148;
    Jena grumbled.
    &#147;There are bodies everywhere. If one more vitae-addled youngster begs me to cast a
    portal back to Arwic . . .&#148;They had heard that sheets of portal-energy had rippled
    through the Direlands, bringing tougher Banderlings, possibly a new Shreth, and ripping
    open paths to long-hidden dungeons. Travelers from Osteth said that at the same time, some
    Shadow Spires began to drift across the landscape. </font></i> </p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;I ran into skeletons today, Hendac; powerful types
    I've not seen before. They erupted from the sand and began marching northeast, as if
    summoned. The mage with me even claimed he'd seen new Drudges in the company of
    Virindi.&#148; She shook her head. &#147;He cast a spectacular new fire spell. He said
    something about a voice from the darkness whispering the formula when he camped one night
    in the south. These days, being able to kill from a distance must be nice. I tell you, I'm
    tempted to make one of those new bows and start fighting from a treetop somewhere. But
    somehow that seems . . . less rewarding.&#148; </font></i> </p>
    <i><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&#147;It's those meatheads in Arwic,
    &#148;Ulgrim slurred
    from the bar. He pointed in their general direction, squinting blearily across the room.
    &#147;Mark my words . . . All those portal storms -- they're destabilizing
    portalspace!&#148; Over Ulgrim's shoulder, Berkholt smiled wryly, and twirled a finger at
    his temple. </font></i> </p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Holding with our commitment to bring you a major,
    world-altering event every month, we will open &quot;The Paths of Destruction&quot; during
    the week of June 5th. A storm of raw portal energy has swept over the Direlands,
    re-opening long-lost paths to ancient catacombs and teleporting powerful new creatures to
    Dereth from other realms. Do the disturbances represent a natural magical flux in this
    sorcery-blasted region, or the work of the dark force that orchestrated the recent Shadow
    invasions? Even now, it is feared, this restless spirit works a new strategy for mischief,
    whispering magical secrets to travelers in the wilderness. Join us next week on the
    strange new paths to adventure! </font> <br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Reports are flooding into the new 
    Direlands outpost of Ayan Baqur about the tide of portal energy that has 
    flowed across the Direlands, depositing powerful new creatures on the 
    landscape and opening portals to new dungeons. Heroes meeting new species of 
    Drudge and Banderling have been at first surprised and then outright 
    dismayed at their amazing speed and ferocity. Even more deadly, huge new 
    skeletons -- perhaps the remains of ancient heroes -- rise towering from the 
    plain and strike with a vitality that only the most potent spells of undeath 
    could render. Lately, an unconfirmed rumor has it that a glittering 
    monstrosity stalks the Obsidian Plain, a construct of sorcery so powerful 
    that it can cleave a legion of heroes like a scythe on wheat.</i> </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Undismayed, Dereth's fearless adventurers 
    make wider and wider sorties into the wilderness to explore the new 
    catacombs, and some have returned carrying a remarkable new kind of bow that 
    appears to be of surpassing quality.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>So what has triggered these events? The 
    Direlands have long been known as a region of unstable magic, but it appears 
    that the wave of portal energy may be far more than a random flux. Travelers 
    from Osteth report that the mysterious Shadow Spires, twisted floating 
    citadels somehow connected with the Shadow invasions, have begun to drift 
    across the land once more, and itinerant mages have learned new spell 
    formulae at the whispering direction of an unseen force. Perhaps the entity 
    responsible for the Shadow attack has returned -- inciting some dark new 
    mischief even as it plays the role of a mysterious benefactor dispensing 
    secrets and opening paths to wonderful new treasures.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fulfilling our commitment to bring you a 
    world-altering event each month, we have opened the &quot;Paths of Destruction&quot; 
    and invite you to explore. Summer has arrived in Dereth, heralded by the 
    flowering of the birches, the increasing heat, and the perfunctory mating 
    calls of once-raucous swamp frogs. Along with ease and warmth, however, 
    summer is known for its storms, but instead of a dark froth of cloud 
    marching across the waste, a shimmering veil of portal magic flows out from 
    the Direlands, opening routes to new dungeons and delivering terrible new 
    monsters to harry the citizens of Dereth. This event also presents a magic 
    scarab that generates new War Magic spells, an artifact quest, an adjustment 
    to specialized skills that makes them extra-potent for high-level 
    characters, and much more. Read the new

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are all the tiny little details of the 
    game update that was made on June 6, 2000. This list is culled from 
    &quot;check-in&quot; notes submitted by the game developers themselves. Things of 
    greatest note are listed first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some changes are not in these build notes, 
    because that would spoil the fun of finding all that has been added or 
    changed! Some changes provide ways for players to drive our evolving story 
    forward, and thus we don't entirely reveal them here. As usual, the Town 
    Criers, Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the trades of 
    crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities 
    of items are not always listed. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Detailed Notes for Builds 2350-2364: </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In rare cases where monsters slowly are 
      being killed while they are unable to counterattack, the experience points 
      awarded will be reduced. See the special section at the end of this 
      article for more details. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added some new War Magic spells. There are 
      some that are available for all levels of war mages as well as some that 
      are reserved for higher-level war mages. We will be keeping an eye on 
      their effectiveness and they may get more powerful in future updates.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added a few new creatures. Variations on 
      current monsters -- expect one nice, new sparkly one. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Specialized skills that are very advanced 
      will take less XP than before to improve. Those with very high specialized 
      skills may see those skills jump up a bit. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Many new dungeons have been added, for 
      players of all levels! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Default keymap will no longer have “v” 
      mapped to drop items. No more “Control-V” or “type 'vibe'&quot; abuses with the 
      default keymap! If you use a customized keymap, you should consider 
      unmapping this key, as it can cause you to drop an item by accident or as 
      the result of following unscrupulous advice. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spellcasting bar now has new keyboard 
      functionality, as requested! Here's more on the UI for spellcasting bars:
      </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Players can switch tabs by clicking on them, 
    or by pressing Next/Previous-TAB keys. These use the SAME keys as the 
    player's currently mapped Increase/Decrease Power/Accuracy keys. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CTRL + Prev Tab = First Tab </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CTRL + Next Tab = Last Tab </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now the Low-Attack/High-Attack keys are 
    mapped to Previous/Next Spell when in Spellcasting mode. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CTRL + Prev Spell = First Spell in List
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">CTRL + Next Spell = Last Spell in List </font>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added a new spell component: diamond 
      scarab. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Long sword damage variance fixed to match 
      that of other swords! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Direlands have become considerably 
      tougher, as warned . . . Prepare to be assaulted by SWAT teams of 
      Banderlings and Drudges! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most problems with missiles going through 
      walls were fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added patron title and name to character 
      appraisal, under the monarch info. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tomes, books, and parchment are bonded to 
      the player -- not magic scrolls, pre-written books and so on, just the 
      blank versions players can buy in shops. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer add yourself to your own 
      @friends list. If you were there before, you'll be deleted. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of the message &quot;This character is 
      still in the world,&quot; you will see &quot;One of your characters is still in the 
      world.&quot; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Reduced the chances of breaking the Atlan 
      stones and tool. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monster corpses are now locked for 30 
      seconds rather than 15. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Having the &quot;frog mating season&quot; last two 
      months is long enough. Reduced the volume of frogs in the swamp a good 
      bit. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Revenant was missing the key to high 
      chest. This is now fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Umbris and Panumbris were suffering from a 
      serious bug in their AI settings, and have now been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tutorial dungeon monsters now give 0 
      killing XP. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters are now smarter about when they 
      heal/revitalize/transfer . . . </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Various problems with cliff edges -- while 
      not all instances of problems on cliff edges were addressed, most of the 
      obvious ones were. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mountain in Direlands where portal-stormed 
      people couldn't get off now has a way down. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An exitless pit in the Direlands was 
      fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some monsters were producing too many 
      keys, upsetting the economy. Fixed. </font></li>

      Baqur has been moved. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mana and other potion encumbrance reduced 
      to 75 units. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A bunch of hitherto too-heavy and 
      inexpensive treasure has been tweaked to be more worthwhile. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Birch trees now blooming. Smaller bush now 
      has pink flowers. Welcome to summer in Dereth!!! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">NPC Felscuda was selectable during combat 
      -- this is fixed now! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In rare cases, generators such as chests 
      would stop working. Fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Kara shopkeeper sells Sho weapons and 
      armor. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed treasure from broken fragment, 
      fragment, and dual fragment so people can instantly find their trophies.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Rainbow tunnels portal is level 
      restricted. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lifestone protection starts after you've 
      teleported to your lifestone, not exactly when you've died. Also, PKer's 
      who get killed by monsters (and hence are still PK and not temporarily NPK) 
      are protected by lifestone immunity. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>More Details About the Experience Point Reduction 
    Code </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    In this update, we introduced this bit of code in a final form. A somewhat 
    different, experimental version of this code was accidentally introduced for 
    several days in May, then subsequently removed. It has now been refined, 
    tested, and added back in. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The general idea is to lessen, but not 
    eliminate, the number of experience points gained when you kill a monster 
    that has tried many, many times to harm you but had no chance of doing so. 
    Typically this happens if you slowly wear down a monster that is hung up on 
    or blocked by some obstacle, such as a wall, slope, rock, building, or the 
    like. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a few important points we want to 
    make clear for those who are concerned about this change. Overall, we 
    predict that very few people will ever notice the change at all. </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you like to strategically use the 
      environment to fight foes that are a match for you, this should not affect 
      you. If the monster dies rather quickly, the reduction code will not kick 
      in. If you are fighting things that are of a level close to yours, you 
      will likely not be affected. This code is designed to curtail only the 
      killing of monsters that are far more powerful than you are, and that 
      therefore take quite a long time to wear down and kill. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">XP is not reduced if the monster is 
      successfully attacking you but still being ineffective due to your high 
      defense skills, awesome armor, protective spells, and so on. The reduction 
      only kicks in if the monster does not even have the slightest chance of 
      hurting you, because either it cannot attack or its attack cannot possibly 
      affect you -- it is hitting an obstacle or is too far away. If you see 
      combat messages that you are resisting or evading an attack, the reduction 
      code will not affect you. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The reduction code does not even start 
      “thinking of” reducing the XP a monster will give you until you attack 
      that monster at least once. Just because it is trying to reach you, its XP 
      will not be reduced -- you need to engage it first. This is different from 
      the early, experimental version of the code. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Also different from the early version, the 
      damage a monster does to you has no effect on how much its XP is reduced. 
      Given the above, this is no longer needed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">While a monster is successfully running 
      towards you, the code will not even “think of” reducing its XP. Like the 
      archers of old, if you kill it before it reaches you, you get your full 
      reward. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before going into technical details, we 
    should answer the charge of “nerfing” this code will bring. “Nerfing” is a 
    term that is widely misused to refer to anything that seems to make a 
    player's virtual life more challenging in any way. The more accurate, fairer 
    definition is a change that changes the properties of a character, or 
    something currently being used by the character, so that the character is 
    less effective in the pursuit of wealth or experience points. Given this 
    definition, we have stuck to our goal of not nerfing our players, with a 
    very few badly needed exceptions. However, even by this precise definition, 
    this code can be seen as nerfing those players who make a practice of 
    gaining experience through slowly chipping away at monsters who are no 
    threat to them. We admit it. We saw that some players were advancing much 
    faster than their peers who did not exploit the . . . er, mental 
    shortcomings of Dereth's nonhuman residents. This code is designed not to 
    stop this practice, but to slow it to a degree that players who like this 
    kind of play do not advance significantly faster than those who do not 
    engage in it. Why did we do this? Because there are many players who like to 
    compete with their peers in the advancement of their characters. These 
    players should not have to feel obligated to stay competitive through use of 
    a technique that most would find the antithesis of an exciting role-playing 
    experience: staying in one spot, watching a monster grind itself uselessly 
    against an obstacle and slowly die. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks for reading this. Now, for some 
    technical details of how the XP reduction code works. Unless you are keenly 
    interested, you may want to stop reading here. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a monster engages a single player, it 
    begins to keep track of how many times it attacks the player and how many of 
    those attacks succeed -- not how many actually do harm, but how many even 
    have a chance of doing so. Upon the death of the monster, the system looks 
    at a ratio of the number of successful attacks (plus a generous modifier, 
    described below) to the total number of attacks. This ratio is then 
    multiplied by the amount of XP a monster would have given, and then the 
    result is given to the player. So the more a monster fails to attack you 
    after a certain threshold, the less XP you'll receive upon its death. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A “successful” attack includes things like 
    evasions, resists, and moderate misses with missile attacks. So if a Lugian 
    is throwing rocks at you and you're sidestepping, those are still counted as 
    successful attacks. If you're standing toe-to-toe with a Drudge and it keeps 
    whiffing, those are successful attacks. If a lich is casting on you, but 
    you're resisting, those are successful attacks. These do not affect the XP 
    given. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first several failures a monster makes, 
    after you've attacked it once, are “free” -- we assume that the monster has 
    gotten temporarily hung up, has chosen a bad attack mode, or that you are 
    doing a bit of strategic use of the environment. The code does not count the 
    first several failures. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, there is a cap on the percent of XP 
    it's possible to lose-- you'll never get 0 XP due to this code. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That's it! We do think this is fair and 
    largely inconsequential to the vast majority. If you still feel shafted 
    after trying it out, we apologize. Balancing a game of this complexity is no 
    easy task, and we have learned much along the way. We promise to serve you 
    better in the future.</font><hr width="65%">

    brought us Asheron’s Call. +MrQuazarr@Zone, our regular emcee for these 
    events, is away this week, and has graciously asked me to assist our guests 
    this evening. Please limit yourself to one question, and have that question 
    pre-typed and ready to post when you are moved into the asking position. 
    That being said, I would like to introduce the Co-Lead Designer of Asheron’s 
    Call, Eri Izawa ! Take it away, Eri ! </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">rei@Turbine&gt; Hi all! I'm going to do 
    introductions and then talk a little bit about how we answer questions. 
    Since I've already been introduced.... With me today are: David &quot;Crowley&quot; 
    Javier, game designer, dungeon maker, and dialogue meister. Jesse &quot;Nei&quot; 
    Kurlancheek, game designer, scripter, general systems guy. Chris &quot;Stormy&quot; 
    L'Etoile, cranky game designer, story writer. Dave &quot;Sarneho&quot; Namerow, 
    Turbine-side Community Manager. Sean Huxter, Lead Artist for AC.... And 
    guest starring Jason Booth, artist extraordinaire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, thanks for coming! As I did 
    last month, I'd like to talk about how we answer questions. To give you an 
    idea of our schedule, we are already hard at work on the July event. So we 
    can with some confidence answer questions about that material (though we 
    won't give away all the secrets ;-). That said, we usually cannot give you 
    concrete dates or feature details for anything new beyond one or two months 
    out. This is because of many factors, including the experimental nature of 
    events, schedule changes, and the fact that something that looks simple may 
    turn out to be very complicated or even impossible! In other words, 
    promising specifics for many of your suggestions would be premature. We 
    don't like promising things we might not be able to deliver. Also, because 
    we have so much planned, new requests on the boards or from here may not be 
    implemented til some time after the suggestion is made. But I want to assure 
    you that we are listening! The spellcasting UI changes happened in large 
    part because of your suggestions at a chat much like this one some months 
    ago. (That includes the improvements to the spellcasting UI this month.) OK, 
    we're ready! </font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; Good Evening, I’d like to start 
    this chat by thanking Turbine and Microsoft for the best game I’ve ever 
    played and one that continues to get better and more interesting as time 
    passes. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; My question regards the cooking 
    skill. In May I would have my alchemist make oils and my cook would produce 
    foods with those oils that were superior to potions in weight, cost and 
    sometimes </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; points returned. That is, 
    alchemy + cooking yielded a result that was better than either skill could 
    achieve by itself. In June the potion weights were reduced to the point 
    where cooking was rendered useless in day-to-day use. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; I can spend four hours making a 
    pack of hearty-healing-hot-kimchi or I can spend 15 minutes making a pack of 
    healing potions and the only difference between the two packs will be that 
    the healing potions are just marginally heavier. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; There is simply no tangible 
    reward for using the cooking skill now that alchemy alone (or the town 
    healers) can produce what used to take cooking and alchemy together to 
    achieve: lightweight advantageous tools to restore health and stamina.
    </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ceazar_AC&gt; My question is this: Hopefully 
    by July, Can cooking and alchemy produce REAL superfoods again - things that 
    are worthwhile to make and carry despite the time and effort involved in 
    making them? Please don’t leave cooking as “that useless skill you need t

    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Jason_400&gt; Eye of the storm etc. look 
    awesome but you really expect mages to hunt diamond golems for their supply

    waves of acid that cause 30-60 dammage and are sent outward from the caster

    to have any Town Criers hinting us or ArchMages out in the wilderness 
    throwing us some clues on the forumlas and will there be a more realistic 
    way to achieve diamond scarabs? Why let these new spells go to waste? </font>

    <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Jason_400&gt; Because these are just way too

	have for fixing this problem is restarting the worlds. If we didn't take

	We will attempt to keep these “maintenance” windows to times when our 
	population is at its lowest; however, from time to time it will be necessary 
	to perform them during peak hours to prevent the hard drives from filling 
	up. <br>
	<br>
	Entirely fixing this problem is one of our top priorities and we should have 
	it finished soon. We have tried a few solutions which unfortunately have not 
	been effective, but we are working on a new solution which is almost certain 
	to fix this problem. Meanwhile, please know that we take this downtime very 
	seriously and are doing everything we can to eliminate the need for it. <br>

	<br>
	If this happens to you and you are locked out for more than five minutes,

	<b>I went right to my corpse soon after dying, but my corpse was gone, or it 
	was empty!</b><br>
	<br>
	Keep in mind that your corpse will not stay there for very long. It will 
	vanish after a number of minutes equal to five times your character level.
	<br>
	<br>
	Also keep in mind that you can only have a limited number of corpses in the 
	world at the same time. If you are over this limit, you will not leave a 
	corpse when you die. Instead, your items will end up on the ground, where 
	they will quickly vanish. <br>
	<br>
	In rare cases, you may die in such a tight and crowded place that your 
	corpse cannot be properly placed, in which case your objects will simply 
	drop to the ground (if they can be placed). <br>
	<br>
	If you are a Player-Killer and killed by another player, that player can 
	loot the items from your corpse. After any items are taken, that corpse will 
	quickly vanish. <br>
	<br>
	If you are in auto-run mode and you lose your connection to the server, your 
	character will keep running for some time until you reconnect or the server 
	times out. Until this happens, your character will keep running without your 
	seeing it, and can get killed by monsters. Your corpse will be in the 
	direction you were running when you disconnected, at some distance away. <br>
	<br>
	Still, all this does not seem to explain some anecdotes we have heard. We 
	are looking carefully into them to assure there is not a bug. Please use the 
	“Urgent Assistance” option to alert our Online Team if you are sure that 
	your corpse is unjustifiably missing. <br>
	<br>
	<b>My character is gone/has items missing!</b><br>
	<br>
	If something strange has happened to your character, such as a location 
	change, missing items, or items having disappeared entirely, you may be the 
	victim of account stealing. This can be done by a few methods, each of which 
	you can prevent. Please refer to our Security article on the &quot;News&quot; page for 
	more information. <br>
	<br>
	I am trying to sign into the Zone, but it says I have the wrong password. I 
	know I'm typing it in right!<br>
	<br>
	Those who are the victims of account stealing (see the previous section) may 
	find that they cannot sign in. This is because the thief has changed the 
	password to your Zone account. Please refer to our Security article on the 
	&quot;News&quot; page for more information.<br>
