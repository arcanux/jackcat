    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>First, there is surprise.</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <em>The wall crumbled inward pinning Jarvis under a mound of earth and the 
    living walls of the Hive. Olthoi swarmed through the gaping hole into the 
    tunnels, shredding his companions in a matter of seconds. Jarvis struggled 
    to reach his sword, but it lay just out of his grasp.</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Arikas, did you say that there were students 
    within the halls?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, Lord Master Asheron, several.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron acknowledged the response with a nod 
    of his head, placing the orb back onto the silken pillow and bringing his 
    hand to his chin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Second, there is pain.<br>
    </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <em>An Olthoi stepped onto the rubble that pinned Jarvis' legs. Jarvis bit 
    back a scream, but could hold it no longer as the Olthoi lowered its eyes to 
    meet his. It was watching him, searching his face for a sign of 
    understanding. Finding none, it hopped on the rubble and the man screamed 
    again. A long pincer stretched from the Olthoi's back and gently touched the 
    side of Jarvis' face. Jarvis was quivering now in a mixture of fear and 
    pain.</em> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Third, there is acceptance.</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Jarvis resigned himself to death. &quot;The 
    pain will end soon,&quot; he repeated over and over in his head, as a pincer 
    thrust itself through Jarvis' right shoulder and another pierced his left 
    shoulder. The Olthoi pulled Jarvis from the rubble, screaming but unable to 
    struggle. As the man screamed, the Olthoi mocked him with its own piercing 
    whine.</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;Then it is decided?&quot; Elysa asked Lord 
    Kresovus and Aun Hareltah.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Our Xuta's shall come together and dance in 
    unison. It is agreed.&quot; Hareltah responded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Lugians of Linvak shall also come 
    together at this great junction and support the common cause. Yet I must 
    state that if trespasses continue on our lands, we will continue to fight.&quot; 
    Kresovus spoke calmly and clearly without a trace of malice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa nodded and the three prepared to speak 
    to their people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Last, there is realization…</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jaleh al-Thani stood and smiled broadly as he 
    clapped his guest on the shoulder.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It has been far too long since last our 
    paths crossed, my friend. Sit, sit; we shall toast to times past.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">His guest sat across from him at the table 
    and produced a cask of cider. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Let us toast with this; it is from the 
    cove.&quot; His guest spoke quietly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Ah yes, the finest of all of Dereth.&quot; Jaleh 
    smiled and offered his cup.</font></p>

    you of how a man came to hold power and how that power was stripped from him 
    in an instant. Let me tell you a tale and let it twist your bones so that 
    you know the true meaning of loss.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He was a wealthy man, having made his money 
    in illicit trade, who spent his days thinking of ways to gain a higher 
    station in life. His existence was solitary and joyless without the touch of 
    money in his hands; but, when he held money and tangible wealth he was full 
    of joy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eventually the man made a bargain and became 
    important in his own right, breaking ground for the first time in years, in 
    a land that many felt was abandoned of anything righteous or good. There, he 
    crafted a society that would net him fortunes beyond compare, and he took a 
    noble rank garnering political clout as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But along the way the man lost sight of who 
    he was, and where he had come from. He forgot his past and thought that he 
    could escape it. But all sane men know that there is no escaping the past.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He made enemies, he made friends, and he 
    forgot everything that had come before. But his past remembered and now it 
    has come calling; and in deep halls removed from the sight of prying eyes 
    and perked ears his screams echo. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is no escaping your past. There is no 
    way to escape death when it comes for you. You cannot buy the loyalty of the 
    reaper, for he doesn't want wealth. He wants your soul.</font></p>

    edition of the <em>Asheron's Call</em> Letter to the Players. Spring is 
    warming into summer, creatures are getting their summer plumage, the fish 
    are biting… and so are the bugs. There are just a few issues we wanted to 
    discuss in this month's Letter, so let's get to it!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Shadowclaim</strong><br>
    <br>
    Twice in the past two months we have called on players to help us gather 
    data, and twice players have answered our call with enthusiasm. Back at the 
    beginning of May, we tested new hardware on the test world of Shadowclaim. 
    The data from that test showed us several weaknesses in that configuration. 
    Then at the end of May, we tested an improved configuration. As we write 
    this we are still analyzing the data, but we can say at the very least that 
    we are getting closer to launching a stable hardware upgrade. None of this 
    would be possible without the energetic assistance of the players, and so we 
    want to thank everyone who helped for the donation of their time and 
    attention. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Isparian Arms</strong><br>
    <br>
    The June update includes some changes to the Isparian Arms quest and to the 
    Isparian weapons themselves. We'll leave you to discover most of the 
    details, but we do want to tell you about the most significant changes.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, we streamlined the quest to obtain the 
    necessary ingredients. These changes should not interrupt anyone who is 
    already midway though the quest, except that you may be able to skip some of 
    the old steps. If you were stuck in this quest due to the state of your 
    quest flags, you will now be able to pick the quest up more or less where 
    you left off. If you have any confusion or questions about this quest, just 
    visit the Arcanum agents in Xarabydun—they will steer you right. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, the process of crafting the Isparian 
    weapons has become simpler. We lowered several of the skill checks in order 
    to make the quest more accessible for lower level characters, and in 
    addition we modified the process that determines the quality of the weapon 
    you create. Previously, the quality of the weapon you received depended on 
    two things: the quality of the infused ingot and your weapon skill. Now, 
    however, only the quality of the infused ingot determines the quality of the 
    weapon. This means that you can no longer accidentally create a weapon with 
    a wield requirement higher than you can wield—although you can still do so 
    deliberately if you really want to. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last, come July, putting a stone into an 
    Isparian weapon no longer destroys the stone. And all existing variants of 
    the Isparian weapons can be transferred between players. Note that this does 
    not necessarily apply to any new Isparian weapon variants that we may add in 
    the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Allegiance Recall</strong><br>
    <br>
    In order to better support our smaller allegiances, we are extending the 
    ability for characters to recall to their monarch's house. Previously the 
    @house mansion_recall command only worked to recall a character to a 
    mansion, but now it will also work to recall a character to a villa 
    (assuming that the monarch owns a villa, of course). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Command-Line Recalls and PK</strong><br>
    <br>
    In June, player killers who have been recently engaged in a PK battle will 
    no longer be able to issue any of the command-line recalls, such as the 
    house recalls, @lifestone, and @marketplace, until they have been out of 
    battle for at least twenty seconds. This is similar to the restriction on 
    using portals during a player-killer battle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Drains</strong><br>
    <br>
    With the June update, characters will benefit from natural drain resistance 
    against stamina and mana drain spells, as well as against health drain 
    spells. In short, the drain resistance listed on your character information 
    panel (also known as the burden panel) will work on all types of drains. 
    Remember that you can use the command @endurance in game to find out more 
    about your natural resistances. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the stamina and mana drain 
    spells will now work just like health drains in terms of percent drained and 
    the received multiplier. The following chart details these changes. </font>

    <br>
    In June, players will have an opportunity to participate in the building of 
    Dereth in a new and exciting fashion. Watch the <em>Asheron's Call: Dark 
    Majesty</em> site (link to
    <a target="_blank" href="http://acdm.turbinegames.com/">
    http://acdm.turbinegames.com/</a>) after the update for more details!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Peril Beneath</strong><br>
    <br>
    Last month, Asheron returned to his old school at Knorr to survey the damage 
    and recover certain volumes of forgotten lore. Against his will, some 
    Isparians followed him there and discovered a great deal of information 
    about the Empyrean—and about their downfall via one angry Olthoi Queen. The 
    Isparians also discovered evidence that the Queen had abandoned Knorr at 
    some point, although she'd left part of her copious brood behind. While 
    Asheron puzzles over who opened the way to Knorr, Elysa worries about signs 
    of increased intelligence among the Olthoi of Dereth. And we are all left 
    with one large question: Where is the Knorr Queen now?<br>
