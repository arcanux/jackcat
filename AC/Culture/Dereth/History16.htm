      The fires have been stoked across Dereth to ward off the coming of the
      harvest season's chill. Brave souls press even further against the Virindi
      tide in an effort to stave their advances and finally bring the cloaked
      beings to heel. All the while the Children of Ispar once again are set for
      revelry in this their time of harvest, celebrating the end of another year
      here on Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Zaikhal a defector from the renegade
      Virindi band has come with a mission for those adventurers with steely
      nerves who are willing to trust him. His tales lend credence to the
      rumblings that the Virindi have begun to establish a New Singularity, here
      on Dereth. He warns that if they are not successful that the renegades
      will win and bring this Singularity here, washing away life as they have
      come to know it. He provides them with a chisel and imparts knowledge of
      the storage facilities that contain the renegade's materials. Armed with
      this new understanding, warriors heed this latest call and strike deep in
      the heart of the Virindi onslaught, hoping to make this the final blow.
      The Isparians will prevail at all costs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alchemists, cooks, and mages, having
      deciphered old riddles and found new delights, have opened their shops to
      all and happily display the new wares that they have to offer. Alchemists
      have enhanced their already potent tonics that restore Mana and close
      grievous wounds. Cooks display and sell new candied items. Those with a
      penchant for sweets have been made to smile once more. Mages have
      fortified the stones that can be used to store Mana so that they break
      less often and have also, with the help of tailors, rewoven the magical
      aspect of apprentice's robes to be wholly beneficial to their wearer.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After seeing the success of the Zaikhal
      Arcanum in forging houses befitting Dereth's defenders, Queen Strathelar
      has commissioned a refurbishment of the pyreal to have a brighter appeal
      to the masses. New shops selling furniture and other wares have opened,
      their patrons stand ready to collect the new pyreal in exchange for the
      goods and services.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In towns all across Dereth inhabitants
      display festival masks in a show of strength in the face of adversity. The
      Virindi war seems to be winding to an end and the Isparians are rejoicing.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet new portals have opened. Something
      about these differs from the portals once forged through the magical might
      of Asheron. These have a sense of being made by another, as a way to coax
      the Isparians somewhere else. Who has forged them and for what purpose?</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head">

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>A Brief History of Marae Lassel</i> </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Marae Lassel, or &quot;Sheltering Isle,&quot; was the 
    name that the original denizens of Asheron's world gave the island. These 
    people, the Empyrean Yalain, maintained the island as a nature preserve and 
    religious retreat, and a Protector of Marae was appointed every decade to 
    preserve the island's habitat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It's interesting to note that records 
    recovered from long undisturbed underground archives indicate that a scandal 
    erupted near the beginning of the reign of Emperor Caerlin I, prior to the 
    Empyrean Shadow War. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the records, a young priestess 
    named Adja testified that the Protector of Marae at the time was not doing 
    her job. In fact, the Protector was actively destroying the island's 
    habitat. At the conclusion of a long public trial, the Protector was 
    stripped of her position and noble title. Her name was expunged from all 
    official records of the Empire. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Olthoi invaded, they were able to 
    spread across the land quickly through a worldwide series of portals, called 
    the Empyrean portal network. To quell the lightning-fast spread of the 
    Olthoi, the Empyreans dismantled the Empyrean portal network and escaped to 
    a world in-between dimensions. One Empyrean, Asheron, remained behind to 
    discover a means to defeat the Olthoi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of the dismantling of the 
    Empyrean portal network, various outlying islands were cut off from Dereth, 
    including Marae Lassel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Marae Lassel's &quot;re-emergence&quot; can be traced 
    to a person named Candeth Martine. History says that Candeth was a member of 
    the Dereth Exploration Society. The Society's leader, Mikael Alayne, 
    betrayed Candeth to the Virindi, a powerful and capricious race of 
    magic-users. The Virindi performed horrible experiments on Candeth, breaking 
    his mind and mutating his body. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eventually, Candeth escaped. He has created a 
    portal from Dereth to Marae Lassel, where he intends to avenge the 
    transgressions against him by destroying the Virindi infrastructure located 
    on the island. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are three human towns in Marae Lassel. 
    Humans are newcomers to Marae, and cluster along pacified coastal areas 
    suitable for relative new adventurers. Just watch out for the highwaymen 
    that have come from Bandit Castle and MacNiall's Freehold. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The monsters will get tougher as people 
      venture further north, and access to the central Marescent Plateau is 
      restricted by level. There are two Tumerok towns in these wilderness 
      areas. They're quite different from one another, for reasons that will be 
      revealed soon enough. One of the Tumerok towns is a virtual fortress built 
      up on the Plateau, and the other can be found hidden deep in the wetlands 
      along the west coast.</font><p><span class="Head"><b>Elements of Revenge

    Fear of the return of the Empyreans consumes one woman, while another, 
    horribly modified by the Virindi, starts down a path to madness and revenge.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="History17.htm">Continued</a></font></td>
