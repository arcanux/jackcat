    <span class="Head">
    <p>The Olthoi Queen was gone. The Isparians had stood as one against an 
    ancient creature which seemed unstoppable, and they had emerged as victors, 
    again. The full depth of her hives and tunnel systems was still 
    unclear—certainly they hadn't all been found—but she was gone. The festival 
    season could commence in earnest.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;But all was not well on Dereth. A queen lay in a death-like slumber, 
    struck down by a treacherous hand. The olthoi, without the guidance of their 
    ancient leader, formed into individual hives led by young and old queens. 
    The would-be hero of the Isparians, Nuhmudira, was missing. Those who last 
    saw her report that she appeared bewildered and stricken with some sort of 
    malady. Sharing her mind with the olthoi queen's was debilitating, and 
    perhaps too much for her aging body to survive. Then there was the singing 
    and the laughter that floated on the wind and rubbed the bones of every 
    living creature.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;That was the past. Now winter fast approaches. The festival season 
    begins, but a melancholy permeates the crisp air. Something is happening in 
    the dark corners of Dereth, and its subtle evidence can be found all across 
    the land. Reports of disappearances, shady travelers and a war brewing in 
    the Valley of Death are spreading.&nbsp; Adventurers search through ruins 
    uncovered by dust storms, and new tunnels shaped of earth. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Not all the news is disheartening. From Fort Tethana, word comes of a 
    weakening in the ranks of the Renegades. Crafters have focused their 
    attentions on unlocking the great mysteries of those objects coveted by the 
    loyalists who have taken residence in the ruins of Yanshi. Mask makers 
    promise to offer a host of new ideas during this festival season. Friends 
    and allies have become a little easier to spot in a crowd; so too have 
    enemies who stalk each other across the world.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;In a room, light returns, servants stand once again, and an old man 
    rejoices. Beings of a dark duality are separated; one descends deeper into 
    the inky recesses of all there is, the reflection is left behind. A lonely 
    man slips through the shadows, feeding from the fear and death that seeps 
    across the land. A woman sits alone in darkness, shivering, afraid to sleep 
    because of the visions that swell within her dreams—horror made personal. 
    Voices, echoing in ancient halls, speak of righting what has been made 
    wrong. Two figures sit at a fire and listen to the ramblings of a sleeping 
    and feverish third. Darkness peels away from a woman's mind; as she stirs 
    from a terrible dream, she is reborn.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Chaos breeds chaos. But even chaos ends. </p>

    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Visions in the Darkness</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What?&quot; the barkeep asked. He looked the 
    vagrant up and down, careful to note that this wasn't the typical dog-tired 
    patron he saw. Still, there was a haggard look to this one. The traveler's 
    eyes were deep set, as though he hadn't slept in months, and his face was 
    pale and thin. He looked half-dead to the barkeep. There were many men like 
    this wandering around Dereth. But this was a little different.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Ale…I've got a long journey home,&quot; the man 
    said. He opened a hand and dropped a few pyreal coins onto the bar. Dust 
    settled out of his hands and off his clothes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Been to the desert?&quot; the barkeep asked, 
    drawing a mug of ale from a spigot.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Aye, just got back. On my way back to the 
    Keep now.&quot; The man cleared his throat and looked around the bar. The barkeep 
    thought he looked like a man with a load of guilt on his shoulders. But he 
    wasn't going to press—he'd keep the conversation polite.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I haven't been to the Keep yet. No need of 
    it. Ale's still being delivered from all over and Lubziklan's delivered his 
    latest batch of cider. Only person missing from the festival is Ulgrim.&quot; At 
    that the barkeep rapped his knuckles on the bar top. His patron looked a 
    little startled as he looked over the edge of his brew. &quot;Yeah…word is that 
    whoever betrayed the High Queen is still at large…&quot; He clucked his tongue. 
    His guest smiled and set his mug down on the bar, then stood to go.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Thanks for the ale.&quot; The haggard man bowed 
    shallowly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Any time, friend.&quot; The barkeep watched the 
    man exit slowly through the tavern door. He shook his head and said aloud, 
    to no one in particular, &quot;Betrayal never pays.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <strong>The Ongoing Saga<br>
    </strong>Last month the heroes of Dereth fought a climactic battle against 
    the broods and swarms of the Ancient Olthoi Queen.&nbsp; While High Queen Elysa 
    Strathelar remained comatose and the Council sought to discover the identity 
    of her assassin, Nuhmudira directed the counterattack.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a time of strange discoveries and 
    stranger allies.&nbsp; Surprisingly, the Undead provided a key ingredient to 
    victory—vials of poison that were used to contaminate the Olthoi food 
    stores.&nbsp; While some heroes poisoned the food supplies and others battled the 
    Ancient Queen directly, Nuhmudira cast a powerful spell that joined her mind 
    to that of the enemy.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Faced with an alien presence in her mind, 
    surrounded by Isparian weapons and spells, and sensing that her broods would 
    be poisoned if they remained, the Ancient Queen fell back.&nbsp; She collapsed 
    the tunnels behind her and fled from Dereth.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After months of battle, the Olthoi have been 
    stopped!&nbsp; Those Olthoi remaining on Dereth are still a threat—and even now 
    Sentinels have taken up residence in the Queen's chambers—but the immediate 
    danger is past.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Questions remain, of course.&nbsp; What were the 
    songs that Nuhmudira sang as she left the caverns?&nbsp; What did the Undead gain 
    from this bargain?&nbsp; Whose voice was laughing on the wind?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now it's time to think about what's happening 
    this month.&nbsp; Here are three of the more interesting changes to the game 
    being made in the November event:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <strong>Fort Tethana Renegade Raids<br>
    </strong>The Tumerok and Lugian Renegades who laid siege to Fort Tethana 
    have pulled their forces back.&nbsp; The power levels of the three Generals have 
    been adjusted to make them challenging to fight, without the time commitment 
    that the quest previously demanded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Quadruple-Bladed Axe<br>
    </strong>While making these changes to the Renegade Raids, we discovered 
    that the Quadruple-Bladed Axe was not working as designed.&nbsp; It was intended 
    to have a hidden quality similar to that of the Renegade Bow and Renegade 
    Crossbow, but we discovered that this hidden quality was not working 
    properly.&nbsp; Therefore, the Axe was considerably less powerful than we had 
    intended.&nbsp; Starting today, the Axe is working as designed.&nbsp; Axe warriors may 
    want to give this weapon another try!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Crippling Blow<br>
    </strong>After watching the dynamic carefully for some time, we decided that 
    the Crippling Blow imbue was not quite as powerful as we had intended it to 
    be.&nbsp; Therefore, we have increased its maximum critical hit multiplier on 
    melee and missile weapons.&nbsp; Because war magic-based critical hits are 
    handled very differently, no change was necessary to Crippling Blow imbues 
    on wands, staffs, and orbs.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who will benefit most from this change 
    are characters who were already getting the maximum effect from the imbue.&nbsp; 
    However, all should see some benefit.&nbsp; Crippling Blow should now have 
    approximately the same level of effectiveness as the Critical Strike imbue.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>New Functionality and Content</strong><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

      and the charge radius has been removed from radar.&nbsp; See the Letter to the 
      Players for more information. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It is now possible to alter the color of 
      your Sunstone Gauntlets. They can't be dyed, but they can be altered—you 
      just have to figure out how. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Leather and armoredillo hide armor have a 
      new look!&nbsp; See the Letter to the Players for more information. </font>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Renegade Raids on Fort Tethana have 
      finally ceased. The Renegades still maintain a camp nearby, however, so we

      fellowship leadership to a fellowship member even if that member is very

      quickly now. </font></li>

    the Players.&nbsp; By now, you've come face to face with the Ancient Olthoi 
    Queen, and perhaps even found a way to defeat her.&nbsp; Now is a good time to 
    take a breather and look into the future!</em><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Splash Screen Changes</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We hope you enjoyed this month's changes to 
    the opening splash screens and the character select screen. As the Olthoi 
    will no longer be an immediate threat in November, these screens will revert 
    to their original look.&nbsp; For those players who want to remember the days 
    when the Olthoi overran Dereth, we've included the screens in this Letter.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Creature Masks Return</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the Olthoi threatening all of Dereth, 
    the three mask makers and their apprentices did not have a chance to create 
    new masks for the month of October.&nbsp; They've decided to cast aside tradition 
    and they're hard at work creating new masks for November!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As if the mask makers didn't have enough work 
    to do, the hunters and explorers of Dereth are reporting better luck in 
    retrieving whole limbs and heads from the creatures that they fight.&nbsp; 
    November should see more of the guises and masks from previous years!&nbsp; 
    However, the creatures that drop these body parts have changed in many 
    cases.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Radar Changes</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting with the November event, you'll see 
    several changes to the radar:&nbsp; </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Charge radius removed.</em>&nbsp; After 
      listening to your feedback, we've decided to
      <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/nov_lttp_shot4.htm" target="_blank">
      <img src="AC1_LttPShot4_1103_th.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="200" height="121"></a>remove 
      the red charge radius from the radar. It only worked outdoors and was only 
      helpful to melee players. We had looked at making it into a toggle, or 
      making it automatically resize when indoors, but doing so proved very 
      difficult.&nbsp; In the end we felt it best just to remove it. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>New PK blips.&nbsp; </em>In the past it 
      could be difficult to distinguish PK from NPK players on radar. The 
      introduction of PK Lite has made this even more challenging. To assist PK 
      and PKL players, we've created a new form of radar blip that is 
      context-sensitive.&nbsp; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting in November, if you are a PK 
      player, other PK players will show up on radar as a red X instead of a red 
      dot.&nbsp; Likewise, if you are a PKL player, other PKL players will show up on 
      radar as a pink X instead of a pink dot.&nbsp; In both cases, members of your 
      monarchy who are the same PK/PKL status as you will show up in the 
      appropriate color as an X with a square in the middle. Players who are a 
      different PK status than you will still show up as dots, and to NPK 
      players all players will still be dots.<a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/nov_lttp_shot3.htm" target="_blank"><img src="AC1_LttPShot3_1103_th.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="300" height="181"></a></font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>New Fellowship blips.&nbsp; </em>To assist 
      in recognizing members of your fellowship, particularly for players who 
      have trouble distinguishing colors, we've made this change for November. 
      Members of your fellowship will now appear on radar as green 
      downward-pointing triangles. Your fellowship leader will still appear as a 
      green upward-pointing triangle.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Chalk Boards</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're introducing a new housing item in 
    November: chalk boards!&nbsp; These are hookable signs that can be written on by 
    anyone who has access to your house.&nbsp; If your house is closed, players on 
    your guest list can write on a hooked chalk board.&nbsp; If your house is open, 
    anyone can write on one!&nbsp; Anyone who can write on the board can erase what 
    was previously written, although the chalk board does display the name of 
    the last player to write on it.&nbsp; Villas and cottages can have one chalk 
    board each, and mansions can

    <img src="AC1_LttpShot2_1103_th.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="250" height="151"></a>have up to 
    three.&nbsp; Unfortunately, chalk boards can't be hooked in apartments.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">New Leather and Armoredillo Hide Armor
    </font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting in November, you'll be able to find 
    new styles of leather armor in creature loot. For now, shopkeepers will 
    continue selling the old style of leather armor.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the Armoredillo Hide armor that 
    is crafted by Leather Crafters has a new style.&nbsp; This changes the look of 
    both new and existing Armoredillo Hide armor pieces.&nbsp; But what if you were 
    really attached to your old look?&nbsp; Don't worry—the old Armoredillo Hide 
    armor used the standard leather art, and you can purchase standard leather 
    armor from a wide variety of shopkeepers.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Sunstone Gauntlets and Alchemy Gems</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're happy to announce that, starting in 
    November, you'll be able to change the color of your Sunstone Gauntlets.&nbsp; 
    These gauntlets can't be dyed, but there is a method—known only to certain 
    denizens of Dereth—to modify their original flamboyant shade.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/nov_lttp_shot1.htm" target="_blank">
    <img src="AC1_LttPShot1_1103_th.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="400" height="241"></a>In 
    addition, you will soon be able to stack several of the life protection gems 
    that you create via alchemy in one inventory space.&nbsp; Both of these are 
    features that players have asked for repeatedly in the past several months, 
    and we are pleased to be able to bring them to you.</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Turbine's Asheron's Call Website</font></h3>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we mentioned in the October Letter to the 
    Players, it was necessary to take the AC:DM site down for maintenance. After 
    the maintenance, one feature we plan on introducing is a dynamic Q&amp;A 
    section.&nbsp; Whenever we answer one of your questions on our forums or a fan 
    site, we want to have that question and answer mirrored in the Q&amp;A.&nbsp; That 
    way there will always be a single site to check to see the most recent 
    information, or to find out if your questions have been already answered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As always, this is just a glimpse at the 
    content we have in store for November.&nbsp; On the day of the event, be sure to 
    read the Dev Notes and Rollout Article for the scoop on everything else 
    we're adding!</font></p>
