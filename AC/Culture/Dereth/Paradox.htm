    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Queen Elysa Strathelar listened to the latest 
    reports of guards reporting from the western Direlands. Celdiseth scowled 
    and Ciandra sat quietly as the report dragged on. Lord Kresovus knelt at 
    Asheron's right and Aun Hareltah at his left. Antius, the latest addition to 
    this council, sat beside Elysa. Nuhmudira seemed thoughtful, her attention 
    focused on the newcomer. Perhaps, she pondered, his inclusion was more for 
    personal reasons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the guards had finished, Elysa looked 
    toward Asheron. Seeing that he remained embroiled in his own thoughts, she 
    dismissed the guards and addressed the gathering. &quot;Lord Kresovus, you said 
    that the Raiders have begun to move camps from around Linvak?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kresovus cleared his throat and stood. &quot;Yes. 
    We have been following their movements. Muldaveus, the commander who 
    betrayed us and named himself Lord of the Raiders, has gone into hiding, 
    leaving his commanders to hold the siege of Linvak Tukal. Whatever his 
    reasons may be, the Raiders have abandoned their siege and have declared war 
    upon all Dereth. They have been spotted near the housing settlements that 
    your Arcanum established-&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I... established the settlements,&quot; Nuhmudira 
    interjected. Her eyes hardened, meeting the gray giant's gaze with no sign 
    of fear.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nuhmudira, please let Lord Kresovus 
    continue.&quot; Elysa did her best to chide the woman gently. Since her ordeal in 
    the previous year, Nuhmudira had become even more the curmudgeon than 
    Celdiseth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But Celdiseth added salt to the wound. &quot;Well 
    then, that puts you in your place doesn't it now?&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Celdiseth!&quot; the Queen snapped. The brusque 
    archmage recoiled from Elysa's glare. Nuhmudira noted this spark of strength 
    and leadership. Asheron sat silently, seeming to ignore the outburst.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I will not see this meeting devolve,&quot; Elysa 
    continued. &quot;We are here to ascertain the cause of these migrations and the 
    fluctuations in the mana streams.&quot; She motioned to Kresovus to continue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kresovus looked ready to relieve Nuhmudira 
    and Celdiseth of their heads. &quot;Thank you. The raiders have spread like a 
    plague through a battle-weakened force.&quot; He knelt.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa nodded to Aun Hareltah to speak next. &quot;Wharu 
    is moving,&quot; he said. &quot;Atua ngamaru's servants, the Hea, also move, but these 
    are not efforts in unison.&quot; He fell silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I've recently come from the Vesayen Isles,&quot; 
    Antius began. &quot;Kryst has seen hordes of Mosswarts crossing through the surf 
    carrying round stones and ritual implements, pursued or aided by Moarsmen.&quot; 
    He paused. &quot;The Undead are also stirring. The emanations beneath Yanshi 
    reveal that the Harbinger still bides within the earth, but its incomplete 
    summoning has left it weakened. Something else is altering the flow of power 
    throughout Dereth, affecting even the innate power of every living thing, 
    including us. Some creatures are gaining strength, while others are 
    weakening.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Noticing her discomfort during Antius's 
    report, Elysa prompted, &quot;Ciandra?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The younger woman responded, &quot;Asheron visited 
    the temples in the north and south. He explained that his people had used 
    these temples as places to rejuvenate themselves.&quot; She paused. &quot;But the 
    source of that healing power was always unknown.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Murmurs of reaction to this news quickly 
    swelled into shouting until even Elysa could not silence it. Suddenly, 
    Asheron separated his hands. A subtle magic filled the room, causing it to 
    fall silent. All eyes, save Nuhmudira's, turned to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron spoke. &quot;I also said that your people 
    would start to feel changes, benevolent changes. This has come to pass. I 
    did wonder what the price of this benevolence would be. There is something 
    out there, something that I cannot discern. Bickering will not help. You are 
    all children on this world, called here by my will. You have always shown 
    remarkable resilience in the things you've accomplished, thriving on 
    adversity and strife. Change is inevitable. Without it you have only 
    stagnation. Stagnation leads to apathy; and apathy is a void into which evil 
    creeps.&quot; He paused. &quot;Magic has not been altered, but I do feel a void. Do 
    not turn upon one another now. Resolve your problems. None of you here is 
    worthy of judging the others.&quot; He cast a pointed glance toward Nuhmudira.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A hushed silence filled the room as Nuhmudira 
    rose and departed.</font></p>

    Puppet slid the slab forward. A sound of steel grating on slate filled the 
    cavity near the energy source. Moments passed, then the observer emerged, 
    changed. As it floated toward Aerbax, a black energy coruscated through the 
    eyes of the mask.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Do you feel enlightened?&quot; Aerbax inquired as 
    he floated closer to the Director.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Harmoniously discordant,&quot; the modified 
    Director replied.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My perfect paradox,&quot; Aerbax said, as he 
    lightly runningan his sickle along the mask of the Director.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira looked to her new assistant as the 
    crystal was placed into the matrix between the anchor points. The Lifestone 
    hummed to life. Nuhmudira had completed the beacons not long ago and had had 
    time to place only a handful across the lands. But this one at the base of 
    the Marescent Plateau would prove to be the greatest accomplishment. She 
    looked at the man and motioned for him to take his leave. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She was mindful of the eyes at her back, for 
    her retainer had returned.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Overlord tore through the human's chest 
    plate, exposing bone and felling him with a single blow. He howled in 
    victory and called his troops to his side. The humans had come to the hall 
    of the Overlord for the last time. No longer would the champion chosen by 
    Hea Arantah stand by idly while invaders came into his home to steal his 
    treasures. The time to show his throat was done. The time to tear out the 
    throats of others was at hand.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi swarmed all around in a rush of 
    madness the like of which the battle party had never seen. Warriors, Nobles 
    and Eviscerators dwarfed the newest breed, but proved to be half as stalwart 
    and strong. The stench of decay filled the air, and acrid smoke billowed 
    from places where ichor dripping from Olthoi maws struck the desert sand. 
    The battle force locked shields as the archers loosed their volleys. Mages 
    launched their spells but to little avail. The melee fighters felt the crush 
    of the encroaching tide of claws. When the dust settled, the human force had 
    survived though many had lost their lives.</font></p>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monster rebalancing is complete. Monsters' 
      levels are more indicative of the areas where they live. Rebalancing 
      involved the revision of melee, missile, and magical abilities and 
      defenses, along with updating the weapons monsters use in combat.&nbsp; More

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've continued our updates of existing 
      quests, so many quests will be more difficult and more rewarding.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Miscellaneous Improvements and 
    Changes</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fellowship panel, and the way in which 
      the game manages the updating and display of fellowship information, has 
      changed slightly. We believe these changes will make the Fellowship panel 
      more useful and less likely to cause problems, but we will be monitoring 
      feedback on the changes and possibly adjusting them if necessary. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The timer on picking up a skill alteration 
      gem has been reduced from 21 days to 14 days. Remember that your timer 
      starts when you pick up the gem, not when you use it, so you can keep 
      several gems in your inventory at one time. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shadow Hunter Armor is now repeatable. If 
      you've already received a complete suit of Shadow Hunter armor, you can 
      give another gem of the quality of armor you desire to one of the Master 
      Armor Smiths. The Smith will let you know that you've completed that 
      particular armor quest, but if you'd like to have another suit of armor 
      made, the smithy will happily craft another for you. They will then return 
      the gem. Handing it to the Smith again will restart the quest from scratch 
      for you. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now use the four non-magic recalls 
      (@lifestone, @marketplace, and the two @house recalls) to get yourself out 
      of a situation in which you are stuck. For instance, if you get stuck 
      bouncing around in a crevasse, try using @lifestone to get free. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several interactions which were 
      one-time-per-character are now repeatable. These include: </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Picking up the infusions for the Sword 
        of Lost Light and the Sword of Lost Hope quests. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Picking up the notes in Nuhmudira's 
        Labyrinth. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Picking up Martine's Mask and Robe.
        </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Getting the Trove Key from Josef, and 
        picking up the Prismatic Stone. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Various interactions with the Blind 
        Snowman.</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Minor Details</strong></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some older portals have had their level 
      restrictions modified or lifted entirely. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now drag your main backpack into 
      the vendor window to sell everything in it. Remember to check your 
      inventory before you sell; you don't want to lose those tinkered items!
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of spells have new icons to 
      better differentiate them from other, similar spells. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The spear version of the Ebon Spine 
      Harpoon was originally intended to do both cold and piercing damage, 
      depending on the power setting at which it was used. Unfortunately, the 
      game does not support that combination of attacks, with the result that 
      the spear never worked correctly. This spear now does cold damage at all 
      power settings; note, however, that the damage remains hollow. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A bug that prevented the tinkering of 
      treasure-generated fire spears has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of existing items are now 
      hookable and can be displayed proudly in your home. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Baby bunnies are back in Dereth. What more 
      do we need to say?</font></li>

    the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/lttp_0303.htm">AC Insider</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the March edition of the <em>
    Asheron's Call</em> Letter to the Players. The <em>AC</em> Live team, in 
    between digging out of the snowstorms, has been extremely busy this past 
    month. March will bring some long overdue changes to the denizens of Dereth. 
    Although there's lots of upcoming content, there's really only one major 
    change we'd like to tell you about before the patch, and that is Monster 
    Rebalancing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the past few months, we've been looking 
    at every single creature in the game in terms of their relative difficulty 
    vs. reward (in both XP and loot) and found that many were unbalanced for the 
    game as it is today. To give you an understanding of what the issues were in 
    examining this problem, we've written a brief Q&amp;A.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong><u>Monster Rebalancing</u></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>1) What does &quot;rebalance&quot; mean?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rebalance means adjusting the skills of the 
    creatures to be more indicative of their level of difficulty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>2) Why rebalance monsters?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While it may not have appeared that monster 
    difficulty was broken, through the years of Asheron's Call development we 
    realized that, at any given time, one class of character would be more 
    pronounced and able than the others. This has been due to an imbalance in 
    creature defenses. We are adjusting this to bring a more acceptable level of 
    difficulty for creatures.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>3) Is it true that you are adjusting 
    creature levels to mirror player levels more closely?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, in a sense, but not in a restrictive 
    manner. We are not looking to create cookie cutter levels. We are trying to 
    give a more adequate representation of the creature level. For example, in 
    some instances levels will be geared only toward an archer of that level; in 
    others, a mage or melee character. The level is now just a more useful tool 
    for you, the player, to gauge what you can or cannot fight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>4) I've heard that you are &quot;nerfing&quot; 
    missile characters. Is this true?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No. We are doing nothing to missile 
    characters directly. What we've stated is that the skill being adjusted for 
    most creatures is their missile defense. This will alter, in some cases, the 
    creatures that missile characters were hunting; however, the most relevant 
    cases are those characters that were hunting creature far above their level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>5) I like/hate the new monster 
    spawns. Why did you do this?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the Virindi story arc, the monster 
    redistribution was a result of Virindi influence over the world. Now that 
    the Virindi are no longer influencing the land, some creatures have begun a 
    natural migration while others make their way across the lands for their own 
    dire purposes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>6) Are the new creatures (Drudge 
    Bloodletters, Banderling Scalpers and Predators, Sclavus Lords, and Olthoi 
    Warriors) balanced?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi Warriors are right where we want them. 
    The Bloodletters, Scalpers, Predators and Lords are very close, though not 
    perfect.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>7) If you are adjusting creature 
    levels, how am I going to earn experience with the XP reduction code?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Every effort is being made to ensure that 
    leveling does not become a tedious measure of diminishing returns. To that 
    end, we are giving creatures designed for a certain level of player a 
    generous buffer in which the creature is still worthwhile to hunt. This does 
    not mean that players will feel it necessary to hunt one grouping of 
    creature until they level. (For example, Gardok has hunted Olthoi Soldiers 
    as his main source of leveling creature from levels 40 to 50. He now finds 
    that the Soldiers [Level 61]&nbsp; have become simple, yet still yield good 
    experience. He had attempted to hunt Nobles before, but often found that he 
    could hit them reliably enough to earn the same amount of experience as he 
    could off of Soldiers. With the new rebalancing complete, he decides to test 
    Nobles out again and finds that he is earning more experience on them now 
    than he was on the Soldiers.)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>8) Are you adjusting creature 
    experience?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes. Creatures will reward you based on their 
    level of difficulty. For most creatures, you will see an increase in the 
    amount of experience that they yield, but for some you'll see a reduction. 
    The goal is to stop the feeling of a leveling treadmill after level 80.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>9) How is experience calculated?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While we cannot give you the exact model for 
    this, we can give you some insight into how we are calculating creature 
    experience. We first determine the level of character for which the creature 
    is designed, then determine whether the creature is designed with deadlier 
    skills than others (e.g., does it have War Magic?, is it Hollow? does it 
    have a breath weapon?). If the creature does have deadlier skills, an 
    enhancement modifier is added to the creature. We then determine how many 
    characters would ideally be suited to face this creature. That number 
    influences the experience yield as well. The final determinant is the 
    creature's skills. The higher these are, the better the experience.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>10) Are you taking away solo 
    advancement?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Certainly not. We are well aware that one of 
    the draws of <em>Asheron's Call</em> is the fact that a player can advance 
    through levels alone. Creatures may be better suited for combat by multiple 
    players, but they are still very defeatable solo. Of course, a group may 
    increase significantly the amount of experience that you can earn over time, 
    but this has been the case for a while.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>11) What about the offensive skills 
    of creatures?</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are being adjusted as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>12) If you are adjusting creature 
    skills, is there hope that player skills like Melee Defense, Missile 
    Defense, and Magic Defense will have more use?</strong></font></p>

    Rebalancing FAQ &nbsp;-

    <font face="Arial" size="2">From 
    the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.accmty.com/idealbb/view.asp?topicID=33265">
    AC Community Boards</a></font><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">1) Why rebalance monsters?<br>
    <br>
    A. While it may appear that monster difficulty was not broken, it has become 
    apparent through the several years of Asheron's Call development that at any 
    given time one &quot;class&quot; of character is more pronounced and able than the 
    others. This has been due to an imbalance in creature defenses. We are 
    adjusting this to bring a more acceptable level of difficulty for creatures.<br>
    <br>
    2) What does &quot;rebalance&quot; mean?<br>
    <br>
    A. Rebalance means adjusting the skills of the creatures to be more 
    indicative of their level of difficulty.<br>
    <br>
    3) Is it true that you are adjusting creature levels to more closely mirror 
    player levels?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes; in a sense. But not in a restrictive manner. We are not looking to 
    create cookie cutter levels. We are trying to give a more adequate 
    representation of the creature level. In some instances those levels will 
    only be geared toward an archer of that level, in others a mage or melee 
    character. The level is now just a more useful tool for you, the player to 
    gauge what you can or cannot fight.<br>
    <br>
    4) I've heard that you are &quot;nerfing&quot; missile characters; is this true?<br>
    <br>
    A. No. Missile characters are having nothing done to them directly. What has 
    been stated is that the skill that most creatures are having adjusted is 
    their missile defense. This will alter, in some cases, the creatures that 
    missile characters were hunting. The most relevant cases however are those 
    characters that were hunting creature far above their level.<br>
    <br>
    5) I like/hate the new monster spawns; why did you do this?<br>
    <br>
    A. During the Virindi story arc the monster redistribution was a result of 
    virindi influence over the world. Now that the virindi are no longer 
    influencing the land some creatures have begun a natural migration, while 
    others make their way across the lands for their own dire purposes.<br>
    <br>
    6) Are the new creatures (Drudge Bloodletters, Banderling Scalpers and 
    Predators, Sclavus Lords and Olthoi Warriors) balanced?<br>
    <br>
    A. Olthoi Warriors are almost right where we want them. The Bloodletters, 
    Scalpers, Predators and Lords are very close, though not perfect.<br>
    <br>
    7) If you are adjusting creature levels how am I going to earn experience 
    with the xp reduction code?<br>
    <br>
    A. Every effort is being made to ensure that leveling does not become a 
    tedious measure of diminishing returns. To that end creatures are being 
    designed for a certain level of player but being given a generous buffer in 
    which the creature is still worthwhile to hunt. This does not mean that 
    players will feel it necessary to hunt one grouping of creature until they 
    level. <br>
    (ex. Gardok has hunted Olthoi Soldiers as his main source of leveling 
    creature from level 40-50. He now finds that the soldiers &nbsp; have become 
    simple yet still yield good experience. He has attempted to hunt Nobles 
    before, but often found that he cannot hit them reliably enough to earn the 
    same amount of experience as he can off of soldiers. With the new 
    rebalancing complete he decides to test them out again and finds that he is 
    earning more experience on the Nobles now than he was on the soldiers.)<br>
    <br>
    8) Are you adjusting creature experience?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes. Creatures will reward you based on their difficulty. Most creatures 
    will see an increase in the amount of experience that they yield, but there 
    will be some that see a reduction. The goal is to stop the feeling of a 
    leveling treadmill after level 80.<br>
    <br>
    9) How is experience calculated?<br>
    <br>
    A. While we cannot give you the exact model for this, we can give you some 
    insight as to how we are calculating the creatures experience. We first 
    determine the level of character that the creature is designed for then 
    determine whether the creature is designed with more deadly skills than 
    others, (Does it have War Magic, is it Hollow does it have a breath weapon?) 
    if the creature does an enhancement modifier is added to the creature. We 
    then determine how many characters would ideally be suited to face this 
    creature. That number influences the experience yield as well. The final 
    determinant is the creatures skills. The higher these are the better the 
    experience.<br>
    <br>
    10) Are you taking away solo advancement?<br>
    <br>
    A. Certainly not. We are well aware that one of the draws of Asheron's Call 
    is the fact that a player can advance through levels alone. Creatures may be 
    better suited for being faced off by multiple players but they are still 
    very soloable. Again though a group may increase the amount of experience 
    that you can earn over time significantly, but this has been the case for a 
    while.<br>
    <br>
    11) What about the offensive skills of creatures?<br>
    <br>
    A. These are being adjusted as well.<br>
    <br>
    12) If you are adjusting creature skills is there hope that player skills 
    like melee defense, missile defense and magic defense will have more use?<br>
    <br>
    A. Yes. Part of this rebalance is to give credence to skills that players 
    have chosen to pay attention to.<br>
    <br>
    13) Are any other aspects of creatures rebalanced or just the skills?<br>
    <br>
    A. In some instances there will be adjustments made to creature damage, 
    armor, abilities such as shield hollow, etc..<br>
    <br>
    14) Is Monster loot going to change?<br>
    <br>
    A. If time permits for some of the loot to change for the March update, then 
    yes some loot profiles will change.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Orion<br>
    &quot;I wonder what that price will be.&quot;<br>

    Turbine's AC Site</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Going 
    Home. Finally, after months (and in some cases, years) of being in foreign 
    territory, the creatures of Dereth are returning home. Tired of roaming 
    alien lands or enduring harsh conditions, the call to return to their native 
    climates has inspired them to migrate back to familiar and welcome terrain. 
    As players traverse the Dereth frontiers, they no longer encounter Mattekars 
    panting in the desert. Nor Sclavus or Mosswarts. Lugians are no longer found 
    in the northern regions. (The truth is, they never really did like it 
    there.) All creatures, with the exception of those that carry with them 
    special treasure chests, have made their way back to the home climate. 
    Additionally, all creatures are set to a more level-centric style of hunting 
    ground.<br>
    <br>
    This was and will continue to be a large and complicated process. Nearly 
    everyone participated. During the planning stages, the entire team discussed 
    and decided on the level categorizations (Newbie = 1-20, High = 60+, <i>etc</i>.) 
    and where these level breaks would appear on the countryside (<i>e.g.</i>, 
    Dires are High and Extreme, NW Osteth is High). This high-level broad 
    implementation has been incorporated in this month's event. While a lot of 
    time has been and continues to be spent on strategy for the rebalancing of 
    monsters, the nitty-gritty details involved in rebalancing all monsters will 
    be worked in over time.<br>
    <br>
    Orion built the generators (for more information on generators, see the 
    article about
    <a target="_blank" href="http://acdm.turbinegames.com/featuredarticles/?action=view&amp;article_id=137">
    generators in the Quest Implementation series</a>). Percentage tables are 
    used to raise and lower the probability for creatures to be brought into the 
    world by a generator. Orion assigned percentages and later, tweaked them to 
    add flavor in specific areas. Zontar dealt with placing the spawn generators 
    in the world. Srand provided level-based input and was (and continues to be) 
    involved in strategy discussions on monster balancing implementations. Speed 
    did integration and the Wumpus did the testing and verification. As usual, 
    there were many meetings on all the different aspects of this process.<br>
    <br>
    To begin with, all existing generators were removed from the landscape. This 
    means hundreds of lines of now useless data have been removed. In this 
    aspect, Speed's time and dedication was invaluable. Once the old generators 
    were removed, Orion could create new generators across the world. He also 
    had to catalogue all the creatures in the game, verify their levels and do 
    some prep work on them for future balancing. Equally important, he 
    catalogued important non-player character (NPC) portals that are necessary 
    parts to old quests, to be sure that they were not missing when this process 
    was completed. Then he drew out hard copies of the spawns. <br>
    <br>
    At which point Zontar stepped in. His responsibility was to place the spawn 
    generators by drawing out the spawns in the game map. All the remaining 
    tasks hinged on this. Without it, the project would have come to a 
    screeching halt. How was this accomplished? Essentially, the spawn 
    generators are painted onto the landscape and associated to a region within 
    Dereth. <br>
    <br>
    Now for the technically gritty details.<br>
    <br>
    Two grayscale graphic files were used. The first is the &quot;Block Encounter&quot; 
    map, which has large blocks of color (shades of gray) that designate 
    different regions (<i>e.g.</i>, Newbie Playgrounds) or areas (<i>e.g.</i>, 
    Tusker Island). The second is the &quot;AC Encounter&quot; map which covers Dereth and 
    has pixel-size dots of varying degrees of gray (very black to fairly white) 
    on it. Each dot represents a generator in the world. Now, the different 
    colors (shades of gray) in both files are assigned a numerical value; these 
    values are then assigned a generator type. Zontar modified these values in a 
    &quot;config&quot; file to add the new generators.<br>
    <br>
    First Zontar had to paint the new regions on the block encounter map. Orion 
    had mapped this, by hand, on a large Mylar map. Then Zontar painted the 
    generators onto the &quot;AC Encounter&quot; map. He used the placement of the 
    original generators, since if he'd painted them in a new random density, he 
    would've been tweaking them for months to come. So he used the original 
    locations and painted the appropriate colors for all the different monster 
    mixes in each geographical location. He used a separate file for each 
    region, about 14 in all. Had he used layers (think sheets of acetate which 
    you can paint on each one separately) in Photoshop, the file sizes would 
    have become unwieldy. Then for each region he utilized layering for each pf 
    the different generator mixes, such as &quot;Shoreline&quot; and &quot;Forests.&quot; The basic 
    process was relatively simple but Zontar did end up having to utilize a wide 
    range of Photoshop methods for selecting items, masking off areas, <i>etc</i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Par for the course with a project of this magnitude, a bug was discovered by 
    the Wumpus during testing. Those adorable and furry little critters we are 
    used to seeing just outside of town: Bunnies. They'd left out the bunnies. 
    In their place, the generators were spawning all manners of monsters that 
    were <b>not</b> content with simply nibbling on carrots - some of these 
    creatures were aggressive enough to follow and attack players in town. Not 
    good. <br>
    <br>
    What happened? Well, the arrangement in the old config file had distributed 
    bunnies in an entirely different manner. With the new encounter and 
    generator setups, it was not clear the bunnies were missing until testing. 
    Zontar placed the bunny generators in an open slot he located within the new 
    config file, looked up where the old bunny generators had been on the 
    Encounter map and painted them in. All on the day of Code Freeze!<br>
    <br>
    So a huge round of both &quot;thanks&quot; with the occasional &quot;whew!&quot; to both Orion 
    and Zontar for their extraordinary efforts this month! And on to new 
    horizons, the next phase, as they and the rest of the team move on to 
    fine-tuning the balancing of these monsters within their native 
    environments.</font><font face="Arial"><p><hr width="65%">
