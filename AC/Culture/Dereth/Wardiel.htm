    oracle has broken his lifelong silence, chanting a litany of baleful 
    portent: the world-devouring serpent uncoils from the cosmic abyss. 
    Bael'Zharon passes like a shadow before the sun, conjuring his altars of 
    strife within the very towns of Dereth, and those who patiently count the 
    stars mark a score fewer each night. Pass the next four days in the manner 
    that appears best to you. The world is in the making, and the agents of 
    chaos sanctioned to destroy.

    <span lang="en-us">From</span> <span lang="en-us">the &quot;Annals of Wardiel&quot;, 
    found on </span>the body of the chronicler Wulfdan<span lang="en-us">, <br>
    </span><br>
    &quot;Fools,&quot; muttered Wardiel as he inspected his battle-axe's edge for the 
    umpteenth time, noting the droplet of blood now oozing from his thumb with 
    grim satisfaction. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;They dare shun me from the lands of Dereth. Well, they'll pay for such 
    impudence with their lives.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    In one cat-like move he leapt to his feet, swinging the axe above his head 
    as he let loose a malevolent battle cry - his eyes growing wider and redder 
    as the crackling electricity emanating from the cold-steel blade slowly 
    sheathed his body. His fury momentarily spent, he again sat down, the air 
    now heavy with ozone and the sickly sweet smell of burning hair. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;They'll get no quarter from me. None! These dimwitted sots will find my axe 
    at their necks soon enough, and I'll send their souls to feed Bael'Zharon.&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    Wardiel's cruel features lightened for a moment on this last thought, as he 
    pondered the population of Dereth under his iron-shod heel. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Aye, Dereth is more filled with harlequins than heroes these days. It sits 
    as ripe as a melon on harvest day, waiting only for me to bring my blade to 
    its delicate skin and spill its treasures onto my plate.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Wardiel again looked out from his high prospect over the lands of Dereth. 
    &quot;Yes, it is time,&quot; he grimaced. &quot;And I am so very hungry.&quot; </font></p>

    Welcome everyone. We will begin the conversation with the designers and 
    program manager of Asheron's Call in 20 minutes!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Welcome everyone and thank you 
    for attending the Asheron's Call status update from Gen Con. We have three 
    very special guest with us today to give an update on the status of 
    Asheron's Call,<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> a Massive Multiplayer Online 
    Role-playing Game developed by Turbine Entertainment and produced by 
    Microsoft.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> We have Chris Pierson, 
    AC_GenCon, who is a game designer at Turbine, and working on Asheron's Call.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Also joining us is Toby 
    Ragaini, auberon@turbine, who is the design director at Turbine, and the 
    lead designer on Asheron's Call.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> And finally the Program 
    Manager for Asheron's Call, Matthew Ford, stucco@zone.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;<span lang="en-us"> </span></font>Each 
    will give a brief update on the status of Asheron's Call and talk about the 
    new and exciting features and updates in the recent Beta 2 release.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Following their presentation, 
    you will be able to ask questions of each. Not all questions may be able to 
    be answered as the game is still in development.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> If you have questions about 
    you potential status in the beta or access to the beta, these three will not 
    be able to help you there unfortunately. You will need to write to ashtest@microsoft.com.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> With that said, let me first 
    introduce Chris Pierson who is live at Gen Con right now.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Hi. We're on our second day now, and 
    the booth is pretty much packed with people. They seem pretty impressed with 
    the game.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> We were mentioned in the local 
    paper, which seems to have made people give us an extra-careful look.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks Chris! Next Toby 
    Ragaini. Toby, what is now on your front of Asheron's Call?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> hi everyone<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> we've been very busy here and 
    beta 2 seems to be shaping up nicely<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> we've already got allegiances 
    consisting of several hundred players, and many people are playing over 6 
    hours a day!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> overall i'm very excited about 
    the way the game is shaping up, and i hope i can answer your questions 
    tonight<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks Toby! Finally, Matthew 
    Ford, the program manager for Asheron's Call, tell us in your eyes about 
    Asheron's Call.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks... hi everyone!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We are now entering a major new 
    pahse of beta.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We have let all our existing beta 
    players in on the &quot;beta 2&quot; code and content<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> It's awesome. People are loving 
    it. The game looks and plays better than ever, which is saying a lot.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We now have about 300 online at 
    once, BUT...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> I'm pleased to make a big 
    announcement!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We have just sent out email to 
    thousands more of the beta testers who are on the waiting list<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> They will soon be getting all the 
    info they need to install and play the game.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We will be aggressively letting in 
    more people all the time... if you are on the official beta list (and you 
    know who you are) keep an eye on the inbox for the next couple weeks!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We are looking forward to seeing 
    the game flourish with new blood... so to speak.. heh heh.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thank you all three! Sounds 
    like Asheron's Call is really shaping up to be one of, if not the top, 
    Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> I would like to open the floor 
    up to questions now. Please keep a few things in mind when you are asking 
    questions. Please keep the questions appropriate to Asheron's Call and keep 
    in mind the zone Code of Conduct.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> If you have questions about 
    your potential status in the beta, those question will not be addressed 
    here, instead please write to ashtest@microsoft.com<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> To ask a question, go to the 
    CHAT menu and select &quot;Ask Question&quot;. You will be moved up to the Waiting 
    Queue. You will be advanced to the Asking Queue when your turn to ask a 
    question comes up.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> When you are done with your 
    question please type &quot;DONE&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Each person will be allowed 
    one question. Due to the constraints of Gen Con, we will have to stop the 
    questions promptly at 4:30 PDT.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Ok, lets get to our 
    question...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Our first question.. go ahead 
    Evaksrathi.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Evaksrathi&gt;</font> Q: What if any sort of new 
    innovations does AC have to offer to gamers over other games of the same 
    genre? And how do you plan to incorperate the advancement of technology, 
    will AC be up-to-speed when 300-600mhz cpus and 16-32meg 3d cards become 
    the...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Evaksrathi&gt;</font> &quot;norm&quot; in the coupleyears to come? 
    It seems that computer technology is getting better, faster, cheaper at 
    quite an astounding pace. (Done)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> I'll answer the technological 
    question<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> AC has an amazing detail on the 
    fly system...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> It detects your frame rate...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> And as your rate gets better it 
    pours more polys onto the screen<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> So if you have an older hardware 
    it's very playable...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> But if you have a screamer of a 
    machine it scales up nicely<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> thats true, also<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;<span lang="en-us"> </span></font>we 
    can update the artwork with newer higher polygon model to effectively keep 
    up with the improvements in tech<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> i'd also like to address the 
    feature comparison question<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> AC was designed to support 
    thousands of gamers in some interesting ways<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> one of these is the emphasis 
    on social systems<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> some of you might be familiar 
    with the allegiance, which allows character to recruit other players, and 
    gain experience and rank for doing this<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> in beta, we are seeing some 
    very cool player interaction which is derived from people roleplaying in 
    their allegiances<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Bob, Go Ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Bob_Bowrest&gt;</font> Q: I've been playing beta since 
    April, and so far I see three major roles emergin, Archer, Mage, and 
    Swordsman. While it is fun to go around killing things and becoming better 
    at killing things, I was wondering if some other roles would be opening 
    up...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Bob_Bowrest&gt;</font> Such as Craftsman or scouts. In 
    particular, I was hoping that one day I would be able to craft fine weapons 
    or armor one day?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Actually, yes, now that you mention 
    it ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> We're currently phasing in some 
    craft skills for the beta ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Cooking, Fletching and Alchemy. So 
    you'll be able to create some stuff, and make some items to help other 
    craftspeople do their jobs even better.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Oewyn000, you're next<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Oewyn000&gt;</font> Is there going to be houses that 
    players can buy, placed or not??? and, (i'm not in the beta) do spells 
    require components to cast?(don)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Second question first -- yes, spells 
    do require components ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> We have a fairly complex language of 
    components, each of which can have one or more meanings, and some of which 
    vary from one spellcaster to another ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Also, spells will consume components 
    (as will spell research).<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> as for houses...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> Right now Dereth is a frontier 
    world, everyone has just arrived.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> It's a bunch of small towns in a 
    wilderness...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> And the lifestyle is nomadic...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We have the capability of letting 
    people buy or quest for houses...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> But frankly we are planning for 
    the long term here...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> And we want to avoid 
    &quot;gentrification&quot; at the moment...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> don't worry, the world will 
    evolve...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> And you'll see Dereth grow into 
    cities...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> But for now we want to keep people 
    wandering the wilderness, finding their home.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> *** Do to the time 
    restrictions, we will need to keep the questions to one per person please. 
    You can re-enter the queue and as time allows, we will try to get to you 
    again.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> YAG, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">__YAG&gt;</font> Hello, i have been reading the AC page 
    and i have a question. What types of monsters will there be and how will hit 
    points be decided?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> well at the moment there are 
    over 40 different types of monsters<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> and each of those types can 
    have a lot of variety. You might find a tumerok warrior, or if you're really 
    unlucky, a tumerok high priest<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> These monsters of course vary 
    widely in their ability, so wise players will assess monsters before 
    attacking them<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Adory, your next!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Adory&gt;</font> As primarily a noncombatant - what 
    assurances would I have that I am welcome in this world. What social 
    structures will encourage trade/craft/socialization - what type of gold and 
    money sinks will regulate the world economics - or will this be called....<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Adory&gt;</font> a world - and merely be a very pretty 
    Quake - a la EQ?<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Adory&gt;</font> done<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> first of all, you don't have 
    to be a combatant in the game world...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> and as Mr. Pierson mentioned, 
    we will continue to introduce the tradeskills to that we will have a complex 
    array of different items to make<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> as for the money sink 
    question...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> to become a truly powerful 
    player in the game, you need to be a monarch with hundreds of players in 
    your allegiance...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> managing this allegiance 
    requires a steady stream of time, money, and equipment if you want to stay 
    on top.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Linus, go ahead.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">MDK_Linus_1&gt; </font>What inspirations from other games 
    are influencing Asheron's Call? what are your opinions on the character 
    selling going on between Everquest and Ultima Online, (people can buy 
    characters other people made on the net) are you guys for it or against 
    it...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">MDK_Linus_1&gt;</font> and who thought of the game? and 
    will there be a fee after buying it? done<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> We were inspired by a lot of 
    source actually<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> Of course pen and paper RPGs 
    are near and dear to the development team<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> and also the old text based 
    MUDs<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> SgtBernard ga... reminder, one 
    question per person please<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">TSC_SgtBernard&gt;</font> Hail Gen Con, I am currently in 
    the beta and have been since Beta 0, I want to know when they will implement 
    some sort of Banking System?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Effectively, that's what trade notes 
    are ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Give a shopkeeper money, and he'll 
    give you a note saying he owes you gold.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> With that in there, a bank would 
    really be redundant.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> DarkCouncil, next question?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">DarkCouncil&gt;</font> Q: Can we expect to see 
    player-focused quests, giving US roles in the game? Quest Items that give 
    the general populace incentive to either praise people, or oppose them? 
    Quests with enough potency that they influence happenings in Dereth?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> Yes, part of what AC has in 
    its arsenal is some technology that allows us to create new quests and 
    seemlessly integrate them into the game<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> what i want to do is create 
    quests that pit allegiances against one and other, and get some really 
    interesting competition going on.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks toby!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> dadown, your next!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">dadown&gt;</font> The latest beta introduced cooking, 
    fletching and alchemy skills, all of which I've tried and found interesting, 
    however, with current pricing they don't seem useful as it costs more to 
    make things that they can be sold for...did I miss something?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> well, we admit that we wont 
    get everything perfect the first time...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> fortunately, thats why we have 
    beta. Ideally, players should be able to profit from their hard work, but 
    not so much that the trade skills be come a 'press to get money' button<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Bob, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">ULTRABob&gt; </font>as linus asked, will there be a fee 
    after buying the game?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; </font>We have not officially released 
    the pricing plan...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; </font>&nbsp;However, you can get some 
    inkling when you see what the other online RPGs are doing...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; </font>&nbsp;And that the other Premium 
    games on the Zone charge a monthly fee...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; </font>&nbsp;Rest assured that we will be 
    competitive, and we will give you plenty for your money.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Spatan, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Spartan1&gt;</font> Will there be any new requirment base 
    for weapons and armor? Its a bit too easy to get good equipment now.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Now that we've done a fair bit of 
    testing on magic items ...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> We're going to be upping 
    restrictions, making them more skill-based. That sword of mondo strength 
    will require a lot of skill to wield.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> MacGyvar, you're up!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">TSC_MacGyvar&gt;</font> Hey, Just a comment... Thanks, I 
    think AC is GREAT, Ive been in since beta 0 and I love it. I hope it will be 
    around a long time in the running and ya'll keep up the awesome work =)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks Mac!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt; </font>hey, thanks a lot<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> Thanks!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">AC_GenCon&gt;</font> Thanks.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> AzBoy, Go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Xx_AzBoy_xX&gt;</font> I am an avid game enthusiast and 
    professional programmer. With the apparent success of AC, are you 
    hiring/recruiting Game Developers/Programmers or Game Administrators? If so, 
    what is the process to apply?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> yes, we are hiring for a lot 
    of different positions....<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> please visist turbines website 
    for info...www.turbinegames.com if dont see a position that describes what 
    you do, send your resume anyway<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">kalgen&gt; </font>As the final release of Asheron's Call 
    approaches, what kind of on-going support and maintenance will the game have 
    to keep it entertaining for the next 2+ (?) years? Can you share any 
    information on the design of any sequels or spinoffs?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> we will have a full time team 
    at turbine dedicated to supporting the game post release...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt; </font>while i cant speak about 
    spin-offs, my hope is that AC will be around in some form for many years.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Ruzie, go ahead!<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">RUZie&gt;</font> How are events going to be handled? Are 
    you just going to do things like having big scale wars or are you going to 
    have &quot;major&quot; things like the new race war servers for everquest. Or both?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> we want to introduce many 
    categories of events from small player run, to huge events that radically 
    change the shape and story of the game...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> and because we can easily, and 
    seemlessly add new content to the game, we plan to deliver<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; </font>Mystic, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">LL_Mystic&gt;</font> Q: Has any thought been giving to 
    players who wish to have their own guilds similar and yet different than the 
    allegiance system? IE - will there be guild affiliations or a main town 
    structure that could allow you to teleport to a guild room/house?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; </font>One thing coming on the Zone is a 
    system where players can form their own teams and associations...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> With their own &quot;dossier&quot; with info 
    such as web page contacts, a leader who can permit/reject applicants, and 
    such...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> This system can dovetail into AC 
    nicely...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> For now we will let the allegiance 
    system do its magic, but having AC pick up the Zone's system of player 
    groups or clans will not be difficult.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Go ahead Xinua<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Xinua&gt; </font>Sorry to bring up this again.. But i'll 
    like to have a strightforward answer, please. Will there be some sort of 
    player owned houses by the time of release? (If not will you have paying 
    custumors paying for the testing when it is introduced?)<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> I can clarify...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We will not have an automatic 
    system for players to buy houses on the day we release...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> As for paying customers to do 
    testing...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> This kind of game is always adding 
    features...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We will NOT release to the paying 
    public something that is buggy. When we roll it out, it will be of high 
    quality....<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt;</font> We plan to keep a running 
    background beta of volunteers even after ship, testing more advanced 
    features.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> *** Just a reminder, Gen Con 
    floor closes in 10 minutes, so it looks like we may not be able to get 
    through all your questions. We will schedule another one of these chats 
    though as we get later into Beta 2.<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Grummash<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Grummash&gt;</font> How well suited is the game to 
    players who wish to interract with others without becoming bonded to them 
    through recruitment or guilds? I am wondering how well a &quot;Loner&quot; will fair 
    in-game.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt; </font>while its true that i think 
    ACs emphasis is on the social potential of online gaming, as a solo player 
    myself, i think its perfectly possible to make a great character without be 
    alligned to any person or group. I know this because ive been doing just 
    that<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> just that, i mean<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> *** OK THIS WILL BE OUR LAST 
    QUESTION GANG!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Goku, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Goku_Vegeta&gt; </font>alrighty, i signed up for the beta 
    like 2 yrs ago, got the confirm message, but arent on beta as a fast 
    tracker, will i get on? And will the game hold true to AD&amp;D standards exp 
    points hps and such?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; </font>Goku, please write to ashtest@microsoft.com<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> ok, we will squeeze one more 
    in<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Khaele, go ahead<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Khaele&gt; </font>What kind of support can player-run 
    quest organizations expect from the developers and staff? I have plans to 
    run such an organization (Call to Adventure) when AC goes commercial. { free 
    plug 8) }<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> well, the zone will support 
    player run events using a special calendar utility that lets certain players 
    pencil in their event...<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">auberon@Turbine&gt;</font> if, say, a certain player 
    event became popular enough, the dev team would be happy to create content 
    appropriate to supporting that event.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> Thank you everyone for coming 
    out and asking so really good questions about Asheron's Call. We look 
    forward to talking to you again in the near future!<br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt;</font> A special thanks to Matthew, 
    Toby and Chris for taking time to be with us tonight! Have a great evening 
    everyone!<br>
