	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As Antius entered the room he 
	removed his helm and shook his head in disbelief.<br>
	<br>
	“Our fears are confirmed. Something new has arrived here on Dereth.” He 
	placed the helm on the table across from Elysa and Fadsahil. “Any news from 
	Shoyanen and Celdiseth?”<br>
	<br>
	“None,” Elysa answered. “I expect that they’ll be contacting us soon. 
	They’ve found nothing that would indicate that there is a barrier around the 
	islands, though.” Elysa rapped her knuckles on the table and kicked her 
	chair back onto two legs. “Are they violent?”<br>
	<br>
	Antius dragged a chair away from the table and sat down hard. “I would say 
	yes, but we don’t speak their language. The mosswart that found his way into 
	Sawato was certainly scared of them though. Yet, I cannot find any 
	indication that it was these new creatures that massacred his people. In 
	fact, I think that something else is responsible for the deaths of the 
	mosswarts.”<br>
	<br>
	Elysa arched a brow and looked at Fadsahil. “Fadsahil, tell Antius your 
	news.” Antius looked to the man and waited expectantly.<br>
	<br>
	“You’ll recall that I’ve been complaining of a strange sound that has been 
	coming from beneath the floor of my shop?” Antius nodded and leaned closer. 
	“It hasn’t ceased, in fact it has increased in persistence. Further, I have 
	noticed that the sclavus in the desert have begun moving closer to my shop. 
	I’ve chased most of them away but they seem drawn there.” Antius didn’t look 
	surprised in the least. “Now, at night I hear scratching. Like something is 
	trying to burrow through the stone.” Fadsahil took up a small goblet and 
	drank deeply.<br>
	<br>
	“Move,” Antius stated and lifted his hands from the table. Elysa smirked 
	across from him. “Don’t take the chance. Whatever overwhelmed the mosswarts 
	in the Blackmire worked swiftly and let the blood from their bodies without 
	leaving any physical marks. Best you don’t rely on magic to save you. Don’t 
	take the chance.”<br>
	<br>
	Fadsahil nodded as Antius concluded. Elysa lowered her chair to the floor. “Antius,” 
	she began, “if we try to make contact with them what do you think will 
	happen?”<br>
	<br>
	“They’ll be violent, I am sure of that.” He shook his head. “So far the 
	beings that we’ve encountered have been diminutive and ineffective but 
	possessed of great speed and tenacity.” He paused. “They are not of this 
	world…”<br>
	<br>
	“Portals?” asked Fadsahil.<br>
	<br>
	“We believe so,” Elysa said as Antius nodded his head in agreement. “Without 
	Asheron here we cannot be sure if he’s ever seen them before, but Shoyanen 
	was in Linvak Tukal assisting Lord Kresovus with a lifestone crystal when 
	the magic was released across Dereth. She was certain that it was tied to 
	portal space in some respect. What were her exact words, Antius?”<br>
	<br>
	“It felt like a ward to keep something out, a place to store bad memories, a 
	spell to seal them away,” Antius said and poured a glass of water for 
	himself.<br>
	<br>
	Elysa nodded then continued. “If it was a spell that had been a ward to seal 
	something away, it is simple to deduce that the arrival of these new 
	creatures was triggered by the very wave that washed over Dereth.” She 
	paused and knocked on the table. “We’ll need to keep watch over the area. 
	Something tells me that this is not done.” She stood and looked at Fadsahil. 
	“Move your shop, requisition a tent and I’ll see about getting builders for 
	you when time allows.” Fadsahil bowed his head. “Antius, we need to go talk 
	with Aun Hareltah. He offered the services of one of his Drumspeakers to act 
	as an intermediary with the anima of Dereth. Perhaps this Drumspeaker can 
	decipher the language of these new arrivals. Let’s meet these new creatures 
	and find out if they are friend or foe.”<br>
	<br>
	She turned and started for the door, Antius stood and followed.</font></p>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">“I’d never have believed 
    it if I hadn’t done it myself.” Celdiseth folded his arms across his chest. 
    “It’s like the ley lines changed, shifted, flooded magic up through the 
    world and into our beings. Who knows where the possibilities will end.” He 
    looked to Ciandra, “It might also explain why Shoyanen was able to start 
    working with lifestones.”<br>
    <br>
    Ciandra chuckled and continued studying the rings on the strange object 
    recovered from the Blackmire Swamp.<br>
    <br>
    “Whatever the cause of this shift in the ley lines, and I’ve got my theories 
    mind you, it isn’t as new as we all think.” He shook his head. “I seem to 
    remember a certain person mentioning something to you not all that long ago 
    about changes and using things that we didn’t wholly understand.” <br>
    <br>
    Ciandra clearly understood the barb, but showed no signs of letting it 
    affect her.<br>
    <br>
    “I think that whatever was done to the ley lines may have facilitated that 
    wave of magic. That’s my take on things.” Celdiseth walked up behind Ciandra. 
    “All these spells casting so fast… it’s just not right.”<br>
    <br>
    Ciandra turned, “Celdiseth, while I appreciate your position I cannot help 
    but wonder why you’re here. If you mean to help me, then please help. Do not 
    yammer to me in thinly veiled nuances that this might all be my fault.” She 
    stared him down.<br>
    <br>
    Celdiseth unfolded his hands and held them palms open. “All right, what can 
    I do?”<br>
    <br>
    Ciandra motioned to a stack of papers. “Review the findings I have written 
    out so far.” Celdiseth nodded and walked toward the stack. As Ciandra turned 
    back to the device a wide smile spread across her face. She had stood up to 
    him and it felt good.<br>

    </font><b><font face="Arial">The Ongoing Saga<br>
    </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The investigations of Antius Blackmoor and the archmagi of the Council have 
    yet to conclusively determine exactly <i>what </i>happened deep within the 
    Blackmire temple last month. One thing is certain – the Burun have arrived, 
    and they don’t appear to be friendly. <br>
    <br>
    The fluctuations in the ley lines have had even more far-reaching effects – 
    the Arcanum has discovered how to cast many enchantments more quickly, 
    allowing the heroes of Dereth to prepare for combat faster. They have also 
    made improvements to dispel spells and potions, allowing for greater ease in 
    ridding oneself of negative spells.<br>
    <br>
    But will these increased powers be enough to face this new threat?<br>
    <br>
    Many of this month’s changes have been already described in detail in </font>
    </span><font face="Arial"><font size="2">the </font><font size="2">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=223">
    Letter to the Players</a></font></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">. 
    There are two additional changes that we’d like to mention in detail.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Arial"><b>Scattershot Fix<br>
    </b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    For some time it’s been possible, at very low levels of Bow, Crossbow and 
    Thrown Weapons skill, to have a “critical failure”. In these cases, your 
    shot would go “wild” and veer far off target. These days it’s only seen 
    frequently on low-level Drudges that use Thrown Weapons.<br>
    <br>
    This code only impacted very low-level characters and creatures, but it was 
    checked on each and every missile attack. This was a small but 
    non-negligible impact on server performance, so we’ve removed it. This 
    should not impact the vast majority of ranged weapons players.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Arial"><b>Skill Gems and Experience</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    It has been possible for some time to get into a difficult state with 
    regards to your unspent experience pool and a skill sellback gem. If the 
    experience that you would gain from untraining or unspecializing a skill 
    would put you above the maximum amount of unspent experience, the game would 
    not allow you to use the sellback gem. For very high-level characters, this 
    could result in situations in which they needed to spend a small amount of 
    XP to get under the cap, but had no skills in which they could spend that 
    amount of XP.<br>
    <br>
    Starting this month, if the experience that you would gain from untraining 
    or unspecializing a skill would put you above the cap, you will be informed 
    of this in the warning dialog box that you receive when using the gem. At 
    that point, you can choose not to use the gem. If you choose to proceed, <b>
    you will lose any experience beyond the maximum unspent of 4,294,967,295</b>.
    <br>
    <br>
    The benefit to this change is that if an untrain or unspecialization would 
    put you only 10 experience points over the cap, you can choose to lose those 
    10 points and continue with the action. In the past, those 10 points would 
    prevent you from using the gem.<br>
    <br>
    One other note about this change – to fit all the necessary text on the 
    screen for this situation, we have reduced the font size used in the gem 
    confirmation dialogs.</font></span></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the April Letter to the Players! 
	Don’t worry, we know it’s technically still March. We’re still working out 
	our communication timetable to take into account changes to our schedule.<br>
	<br>
	Last month in Dereth, a strange temple was discovered deep in the Blackmire 
	Swamp. Those adventurers who dared explore its depths found relics and 
	artifacts from the Falatacot witches... and something more. An ancient 
	ritual was completed. A portal was opened. Something came through.<br>
	<br>
	Burun.<br>
	<br>
	How will these new creatures impact the balance of power in Dereth? Will 
	more come through? Are there more temples like this scattered throughout the 
	landscape?<br>
	<br>
	And where the heck is Ulgrim?<br>
	<br>
	Now let’s take a look at some of the changes coming in April and beyond.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><b>Coming Soon</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	<i>(These are items that we plan to implement in the April event. Many of 
	these items were mentioned in last month’s <b>In Development</b> section.)</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>Darktide Recompense</b><br>
	The Darktide Recompense will end as of the April event. The Town Criers will 
	not give you a token after the April event and, more importantly, will not 
	reward you if you give them your token. They’ll just keep it, as Town Criers 
	normally do.</font><p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>New Armor</b><br>
	In April, we will be introducing three new types of loot armor – Aluvian 
	Lorica armor, Gharu’n Nariyid armor, and Sho Chiran armor. You’ll see the 
	first glimpses of these new armor suites in the April Teaser, and you can 
	find more information on their appearance in loot in our
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=217#aprilarmor">
	in-depth Treasure article</a>.</font><p>
    <b><font face="Arial" size="2">Treasure Changes, Phase 3</font></b><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">The treasure changes are described in great 
	detail in <a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=217#april">
	our in-depth Treasure article</a>. Here’s a quick summary of the changes 
	that are coming in April:</font></p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Creatures that were within 5 levels of a 
		higher difficulty band will have the wealth level of their loot 
		increased. Some creatures have had the “quality” property added to their 
		loot, and some group-oriented creatures will drop more loot.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the three new types of 
		armor, the spread of all armor in loot will be adjusted. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The wield requirements on Covenant armor 
		will be in bands similar to the wield requirements on weapons, and 
		Covenant armor with magic defense requirements may be found.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Attack and Defense modifiers will appear 
		more frequently on weapons. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mana Conversion modifiers will also 
		appear more frequently on casters, and the average Mana Conversion 
		modifier will be adjusted upwards. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You will be able to find Melee Defense 
		modifiers on casting items, and Missile Defense and Magic Defense 
		modifiers on all weapons and casting items. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Casting items will have the ability to 
		generate with Defender due to the above change, and will also have the 
		ability to generate with the Hermetic Link spell or cantrips for any of 
		the spells that can be found on them.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>“Second-class” Weapon Upgrades<br>
	</b><br>
	In the past, some weapons within a weapon class were just plain undesirable. 
	For example, if you were a Mace user and you wanted maximum damage, there 
	was no reason to look at anything other than a Morningstar. You turned up 
	your nose at a Kasrullah.<br>
	<br>
	In April, we’ll be making changes to bring the low-end damage weapons closer 
	to par with the maximum damage weapons in each class. This is similar to the 
	changes we made to bows and crossbows last year; however we are not 
	necessarily giving all weapons within a class the same maximum damage. In 
	many weapon classes there will still be weapons that have a lower maximum 
	than others, but the difference will be much smaller. <br>
	<br>
	No weapon class is having its maximum damage increased, and some classes are 
	being changed more than others. For example, all three types of Unarmed 
	Combat weapons had the same maximum damage, so they will not be touched. 
	Weapons that are considered to be a “secondary damage type” – Rapiers, 
	Spiked Clubs, Naginatas, and Warhammers – are not being changed, and we are 
	taking into account the differences between hiltable and non-hiltable Swords 
	and Daggers.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Buffing Improvements</b></font><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">The Buffing Changes article provides information 
	on all of our planned buffing improvements and how they fit together. The 
	first of these, faster self-buffs, is planned for April.<br>
	<br>
	In April, all Creature and Life Self buffs will cast at the same speed as a 
	level I spell, no matter what their level. This should cut down on the 
	amount of time spent preparing for battle for players who cast their own 
	buffs. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Fellowship Spells</b></font><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">As we have hinted in the past, we are 
	introducing spells that can be cast on all members of a fellowship 
	simultaneously. The first of these spells that can be cast by players are 
	planned for April. We are taking it slow with these – they are only 
	attribute buffs, and no more powerful than existing spells. </font>
	<p>
    <b><font face="Arial" size="2">Vendor Buy-Sell Rates</font></b><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Ever since the creature spawn changes, there 
	have been some disparities between the difficulty of hunting around certain 
	towns and the buy-sell rates of the vendors inside those towns. In April, we 
	will be adjusting the vendor buy-sell rates in several towns.<br>
	<br>
	The new buy-sell rates will be based on the difficulty of the surrounding 
	content. You can see the difficulty breakdown in our
	<a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/files/47/18/69/01/92.jpg">Creature 
	Distribution Map</a>. The three capital cities – Cragstone, Hebian-To, and 
	Zaikhal – were given special consideration.<br>
	<br>
	In addition, to give each town some unique flavor, each town will have at 
	least one vendor who has better buy/sell rates than the rest of the town.
	<br>
	<br>
	These tables show each town’s new values along with its old values.</font><p align="center">

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Applesauce and Potion Changes<br>
	</b><br>
	In response to player issues regarding money macros, we will be adjusting 
	the value of some items to decrease the effectiveness of these macros. These 
	changes will also make it cheaper for players to purchase Mana Draughts, 
	Mana Potions, Health Draughts, and Health Potions.</font></p>
	<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Dispel Spells</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For information on the Dispel changes in 
	April, please see the full-length Dispel Spells article. <br>
	<br>
	The feedback on the suggested dispel timer for PK/L was very mixed. There 
	was no clear majority either for or against. With that in mind, we’ve gone 
	ahead with the changes that we feel best improve majority of PK/L combat: 
	we’ve decided to implement the PK/L timer on dispels. If you have been in a 
	PK/L action within the last 20 seconds, you will not be able to:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Use a dispel gem.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Use a dispel potion.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Use the Awakener or Attenuated Awakener 
		on someone else.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Cast any dispel spell on yourself.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Cast any dispel spell on someone else.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once these changes are in place we will be 
	monitoring them and their impact on PvP play.</font></p>
	<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">House Purchase Timer</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An issue that has resulted in a great deal of 
	feedback is that of players camping houses solely for the purpose of resale 
	and a profit. We’ve discussed two possible solutions in feedback threads 
	within the last few weeks, and chosen to implement this one.<br>
	<br>
	In April we will be introducing a one month timer on purchasing cottages, 
	villas, and mansions. Residential Quarters will be exempt from this timer. 
	This timer is per account, not per character. The timer does not extend 
	across worlds. After reading through your feedback and discussing the 
	engineering and social aspects of all of your suggestions, we’ve decided 
	that this is the best solution currently available to us.<br>
	<br>
	What does this mean? Once you purchase a house, you must wait 30 days before 
	you can purchase a new one. If you own a house, your housing panel will tell 
	you when you purchased it and when you can purchase a new one. If you do not 
	own a house, your housing panel will tell you when you can purchase a new 
	one. <br>
	<br>
	It is important to note that this has nothing to do with when you lose a 
	house, either through @house abandon or failure to pay maintenance. If you 
	have owned a house for several months and abandon it, you will be able to 
	purchase another house immediately. What you cannot do is purchase a house, 
	abandon it less than 30 days later, and then purchase another house 
	immediately.<br>
	<br>
	Apartments in the Residential Quarters are completely unaffected by this 
	timer. Buying an apartment neither checks the timer nor sets it. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Live Lore Events<br>
	</b>
	<br>
	Recently Morningthaw saw a live lore event, in which Antius sought out 
	several players who had completed the Blackmire Temple quest. This was the 
	first of a new type of live event. While we will rotate through the worlds 
	for these events, each individual event will take place on only one world. 
	These events will be described in lore articles on our website.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Content Revisions</b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are revising two towns and two quests in 
	April. Holtburg will be revised in the same way that Shoushi and Yaraq were 
	previously. The portal drops and Lifestone locations will be made more 
	convenient, and the surrounding content will be adjusted for balance.<br>
	<br>
	The second town that we are revising is the Lugian fortress of Linvak Tukal. 
	It will be getting a Lifestone and direct portal access, without the need to 
	fight through the entryway.<br>
	<br>
	Along with Linvak Tukal, we are revising the Arm, Heart, Mind quest. 
	Confusing aspects of the quest timing will be fixed, and the quest rewards 
	will be adjusted.<br>
	<br>
	The second quest to be revised is the Little Green Seeds quest. Terese’s 
	interactions and the Swamp Garden will be revised, and new types of seeds 
	for higher-level creatures will be introduced. This doesn’t mean new colors 
	of dye, however.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Envoy Policy Changes</b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Inscription and Name Change policy 
	changes will go into effect immediately. The Marketplace policy change will 
	go into effect as of the April event.</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Inscriptions. </b>The Envoys will 
		continue to remove inscriptions which violate the Code of Conduct. 
		Please use the Urgent Assistance button in your options panel to report 
		these inscriptions. These requests will be low priority, so please be 
		patient. Urgent Assistance should not be used to report inscriptions 
		that do not violate Code of Conduct – requests reported in this way will 
		be refused.<br>
		<br>
		Removal of other inscriptions will be done by Envoys when they are 
		visiting a world. You will know that an Envoy is “visiting” if the Envoy 
		is not wearing a helm and has a particle effect around him or her. If 
		you see an Envoy visiting, feel free to ask him or her to uninscribe any 
		of your items. In addition, the Envoys may schedule “Uninscription 
		Parties” to be held in town Meeting Halls. These parties will be 
		announced in advance on the Asheron’s Call forums.<br>
		<br>
		At these times, any inscription will be erased on request – the 
		inscriptions will not be reviewed for content. We have read your 
		concerns regarding this process but in the end have decided that the 
		good outweighs the potential harm.<br>
		<br>
		In all cases, uninscribing items will be a lower priority than other 
		Envoy tasks.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Name Changes.</b> Players of any 
		level who feel that their name is in violation of the Code of Conduct 
		can request a one-time name change at ou<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fuzeqna.com/asheronscall/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=454">r 
		Customer Service site</a>. <i>Only</i> 
		names that violate Code of Conduct will be changed. This program will 
		last until June 1, 2004.<br>
		<br>
		After June 1, characters with offensive names will be investigated. 
		Characters that are level 20 or greater will be referred to the Customer 
		Service link above. Characters that are level 19 or below may be 
		required to be deleted.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Marketplace.</b> Starting with the 
		April event, we ask that all players move to a vendor stall in one of 
		the outlying rooms. Players offering buffs or tinkers should move to a 
		vendor stall or to the second floor of one of the outlying rooms. This 
		is intended to improve Marketplace visual performance for all players. 
		Envoys will have the authority to move players that do not follow these 
		guidelines. This can include moving them out of the Marketplace into 
		special rooms where they cannot interact with others.<br>
		<br>
		It is important to remember that the speech of all characters must abide 
		by the Code of Conduct. This includes any text messages displayed by any 
		unattended characters – Tradebots, Buffbots, and the like.</font></li>

	the Players</a>, the <b>In Development</b>&nbsp; section listed a number of 
	changes that we are working on for May. We’d like to take this time to 
	provide further details as well as describe some additional changes that 
	we’re working on. We know you haven’t even had a chance to see the April 
	event yet, but we’d like to start getting feedback on these topics while 
	we’re still early in the May development cycle.<br>
	<br>
	It’s important to remember that these topics are currently in development 
	and not guaranteed for the May event. It’s quite possible that, based on 
	your feedback or other factors, some or all of these topics could be delayed 
	or removed altogether.</font><p><font face="Arial"><b>Allegiance Tools<br>
	</b><font size="2"><br>
	We’re planning to give allegiances a number of new tools in May. Most of 
	these are intended to make managing an allegiance easier. Here’s what we’re 
	working on:</font></font><ul>
		<li><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Allegiance account boot:</b> A 
		command to boot all characters on the same account from an allegiance. 
		The player running this command would most likely be informed of the 
		number of characters booted, but not their names. <br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Allegiance account ban:</b> A 
		command to ban all characters on the same account from swearing into 
		your allegiance. Note that this would only ban them from swearing in, 
		not automatically boot them. To permanently remove all characters on an 
		account from your allegiance, you would need to do an account boot and 
		an account ban.<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Allegiance chat kick:</b> A 
		command to temporarily remove a character from the allegiance chat room. 
		This wouldn’t be a permanent removal – the character could get back in 
		simply by toggling allegiance chat back on – but it would get across the 
		point that the player’s behavior isn’t appropriate for your allegiance.<br>
		<br>
		We are currently working on general improvements to the chat system 
		which, when implemented, will allow for better controls on the 
		allegiance chat system. This is intended to provide some of that 
		functionality until the larger changes go in.<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Allegiance officers:</b> 
		Allegiance officers would be initially designated by the monarch, and 
		would have the power to run any existing monarch command: all of the 
		broadcast and message of the day commands, <i>@allegiance info</i>, the 
		ability to designate or remove other officers, and all of the boot, ban, 
		and kick commands. They would not have the ability to change allegiance 
		mansion or villa guest or storage lists. Allegiance officers also will 
		not be able to boot the monarch.<br>
		<br>
		Allegiances would be able to have two allegiance officers. The 
		allegiance officer position would replace the existing allegiance 
		speaker position. For the sake of security, existing allegiance speakers 
		would have their position removed during the May event.<br>
&nbsp;</font></font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Allegiance house storage:</b> 
		All allegiance members would be able to open the storage in their 
		personal homes to the members of their allegiance in one command, 
		similar to the ability to add their entire allegiance to the house guest 
		list.</font></font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><b><font face="Arial">Allegiance Bindstones<br>
		</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
		This is part of the Allegiance improvements, but deserves its own topic. 
		There’s also a feedback thread focused specifically on this idea.<br>
		<br>
		The idea is very straightforward: Allegiance monarchs would have the 
		ability to tie to a stone in town in the same way that players tie to a 
		Lifestone. Once the monarch has tied to the Bindstone, all members of 
		that monarch’s allegiance could recall to the town through a chat 
		command. We currently plan to place these Bindstones in or near town 
		Meeting Halls, and we are going to move several Meeting Halls closer to 
		the center of town. We don’t expect that all towns would initially have 
		these Bindstones – most likely we will start with a small number of 
		towns and increase them over time.<br>
		<br>
		There are two goals driving this idea. We want to encourage players to 
		gather in towns, and we want to provide monarchies that do not have a 
		mansion or villa with a central meeting spot.<br>
		<br>
		There’s one aspect of this plan on which your feedback would be 
		particularly valuable. We would like to gauge whether monarchies that 
		currently gather at their mansions or villas would start spending more 
		time in towns if they had an additional gathering spot. If this is not a 
		feature that would encourage housing-owning allegiances to congregate in 
		towns, then we are more inclined to limit this functionality to those 
		allegiances that do not own mansions or villas.<br>
		<br>
		To help us resolve this issue, we’ve opened up a feedback thread
		<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6366">
		here</a>. It would be most helpful if you could answer the following 
		questions:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">How do you decide where to socialize 
			with your fellow allegiance members? </font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you could choose between 
			gathering at your mansion and gathering in town, and both were an 
			equally easy recall, where would you gather? </font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">In your opinion, how valuable is the 
			central recall location feature of allegiance housing, in comparison 
			to the other features of allegiance housing? </font></li>
			</ul>
			<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of this writing, it is quite 
			possible that this feature will not be ready for May. <br>
			</font><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><br>
			</font><b>Treasure Revisions, Part IV<br>
			</b><font size="2"><br>
			In the April Letter to the Players, we stated that the Treasure work 
			for May would be back-end and not visible to players. This is no 
			longer true – we’ve found ourselves with the opportunity to improve 
			treasure selection in several places.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Art Items, Casters, and Coins</b><br>
			We’re moving “art items” (mugs, plates, and the like) and casters 
			into several loot tables where they previously did not exist. This 
			will result in both being found in places where you could not find 
			them before – for example, in May you’ll be able to find casters in 
			the casino golden chests. This will make casting items – as well as 
			certain types of salvage – easier to find.<br>
			<br>
			In addition, we are removing pyreal coins from several loot tables, 
			and replacing them with other items from the tables.<br>
			<br>
			<b>“Mundane” Items</b><br>
			This category covers all the “other” things found in loot – spell 
			components, mana stones, healing kits, lockpicks, and potions. These 
			categories of items have not changed much since the early days of 
			Asheron’s Call, and the treasure revisions have only highlighted 
			this. <br>
			<br>
			To improve the situation, we will be adding new types of mana stones 
			and potions, and low-level healing kits are being improved and 
			renamed. Then we’ll be redistributing all mundane items across 
			different levels of treasure. <br>
			<br>
			Just as an example, here’s how the changes would affect the types of 
			items you could find in wealth rating 5 treasure, intended for level 
			80+ characters.</font></font></p>

			<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">In general, we’ve made existing 
			items show up sooner and created new items to fill the gaps at the 
			high end. You’ll note that there are no new lockpicks yet – don’t 
			worry, we’re working on some ideas for interesting high-end 
			lockpicks.</font><br>
			<br>
			<b>Ranged Attack Changes<br>
			</b><font size="2"><br>
			We have two proposed changes for ranged attack users. One of these 
			was previously mentioned as </font><b><font size="2">In Concept</font></b><font size="2"> 
			in the </font><font size="2">
			<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=211">
			March Letter to the Players Follow-Up</a></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial">, 
			the second is an idea that has been discussed but never officially 
			added to the development schedule.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Speed / Accuracy Slider<br>
			</b><br>
			Currently, the Speed / Accuracy slider for Bow, Crossbow, and Thrown 
			Weapons allows the player to decide whether to attack more quickly 
			at the expense of accuracy, or more accurately at the expense of 
			speed. At the far left of the slider, the attack is fastest but 
			incurs a 50% penalty to the player’s attack skill. At the far right, 
			the attack is slowest but gives a 50% bonus to skill.<br>
			<br>
			We would like to improve ranged attacks, particularly in PvP combat, 
			by decreasing the penalty at the far left side of the slider. Our 
			current plans are to lower the 50% penalty to only 40%. The entire 
			slider would then scale evenly from -40% to +50%. Player feedback 
			and further playtesting may cause this to change, watch for further 
			details.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Projectile Physics<br>
			<br>
			</b>Another issue that we’ve seen for ranged weapon users is that 
			their projectiles are quite narrow. For example, the size of the 
			physics object on an arrow is currently about the circumference of 
			the shaft. It is fairly easy for monsters or other players to dodge 
			incoming attacks by moving a very small distance. <br>
			<br>
			We are investigating increasing the size of projectile physics 
			objects to make these attacks hit more frequently. We do not expect 
			this change to be very large, but it should improve the ability of 
			Bow, Crossbow, and Thrown Weapons users to physically hit their 
			target. For example, we are considering increasing the size of the 
			physics object on an arrow to be about the circumference of the base 
			of the arrowhead. This would approximately double the width of the 
			physics object. The calculations of evading due to Missile Defense 
			will not be changed.</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Arial">Negative Spell Timers<br>
			</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Currently there is a disparity in the length of negative spells 
			across different levels. Level VI negative spells last for 8 
			minutes, while level VII negative spells only last for 4 minutes. 
			We’d like to change all negative spells to the following times:</font></p>

    <font size="2">We’d like to take this time to make a number of announcements regarding the 
	expansion pack, some personnel changes on the Live Team, the new game world 
	and a few surprises!</font><br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="3">The Expansion Pack</font></b><br>
	<br>
	<font size="2">We’re thrilled to be able to
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=229">
	formally announce</a> production of the next Asheron’s Call expansion pack. 
	We’re also excited to announce that Srand will be leaving her position as 
	Live Team Producer and Lead Engineer to take the role of Lead Engineer on 
	the expansion pack. While we on the Live Team will miss her, we know that 
	her expertise – both in engineering and game design – will be extremely 
	valuable to the expansion pack team.</font><br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="3">The Live Team</font></b><br>
	<br>
	<font size="2">We’re also excited to announce that Mirin, currently Lead Designer for the 
	AC1 Live Team, will be taking over as Live Team Producer. Mirin has a long 
	history with AC1, having started as a Designer on Asheron’s Call: Dark 
	Majesty. <br>
	<br>
	Later today, Warcry’s Crossroads of Dereth will be publishing an interview 
	with Mirin in which she describes her past experience with Asheron’s Call 
	and her goals as the new Producer of the AC1 Live Team. While you may not 
	recognize her current handle, we’re sure you’ll recognize the content that 
	she’s added to the game.<br>
	<br>
	The spot of Lead Designer is being filled by Orion, who has been a Designer 
	on the AC1 Live Team for the past two and a half years. Many of you are 
	familiar with Orion from his presence in the Asheron’s Call community as 
	well as from his epic content such as the Gaerlan Quest. Orion is also 
	currently the writer at the helm of AC1’s lore and backstory.<br>
	</font>
	<br>
	<b><font size="3">A New World</font></b><br>
	<br>
	<font size="2">As we announced in
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=156">
	January</a>, we plan to bring a new Asheron’s Call world online later this 
	Spring. We’re now ready to announce both the name of this new world and the 
	date it will be available.<br>
	<br>
	The next Asheron’s Call world will be named <i><b>Verdantine</b></i> and 
	will be brought online on the same day as the May event, currently scheduled 
	for May 12.</font><br>
	<br>
	<b><font size="3">Gifts for our Players</font><br>
	</b><br>
	<font size="2">As further thanks to our loyal players for staying with us during this 
	transition, we’ll be giving you two free gifts in the April and June events.<br>
	<br>
	After the April event, existing characters will be able to obtain a new 
	Raiment from an NPC in Al-Arqas.<br>
	<br>
	With the June event comes an even bigger gift: All existing Asheron’s Call 
	accounts will be given <b>a sixth character slot on all worlds</b>. This 
	gift is only for existing accounts – new accounts after the June event will 
	still have only five character slots. <br>
	<br>
	Thank you again for being our customers! We’re very excited about the future 
	of Asheron’s Call and we hope you are too!<br>

	Turbine Site</a>, April 20, 2004</span></font><p>We have some good news and 
    some bad news on these topics.</p>
    <p>First, the bad news: Due to unforeseen complications, it will not be 
    possible to bring Verdantine online for the May event as we had previously 
    announced. We’re very sorry about this – we try hard to make sure that our 
    dates are accurate before we announce them. Unfortunately in this case, 
    there is a lot more NetOps work that needs to be done to get the world in 
    shape than we anticipated. Our current plans are for Verdantine to be 
    brought up in the June event, tentatively scheduled for June 9.</p>
    <p>The second item of less-than-wonderful news: As part of our preparation 
    for the sixth character slot in June, we added code this month to allow the 
    display of more than five characters at the character select screen. 
    Unfortunately, this exposed a bug that had been hidden in the code for many 
    years. &nbsp;In the past, it was possible to get into a strange state in which 
    you had more than five characters on your account, but the game would only 
    show five at the character select screen. Sometimes it would be a 
    recently-restored character that “disappeared;” sometimes it would be a 
    newly-created character. </p>
    <p>When we added the new display in the April event, players who had 
    experienced this bug in the past suddenly found all six characters visible 
    and playable. Some players even figured out how to exploit this bug to 
    intentionally create six playable characters.</p>
    <p>On Monday, April 26, we will be patching the game to fix this bug. The 
    servers will be brought down at 6:00 AM PDT / 9:00 AM EDT / 1:00 PM GMT, and 
    we expect them to be down for approximately four hours. During this 
    downtime, we will be fixing the bug noted above, as well as fixing a bug 
    that was causing some players to be ignored by monsters after having been 
    banned for UCM.</p>
    <p>Now for the good news: During this same patch, we will be unlocking the 
    sixth character slot for all accounts on all worlds. We’re also making the 
    extra character slot active for <i>all</i> accounts – both existing and 
    newly created – as well as opening it on all worlds, whether or not you 
    currently have characters on the world. All accounts will have six character 
    slots on Verdantine when it opens.</p>
    <p>One question you may ask is, <i>If we’re giving everyone the sixth 
    character slot anyways, why fix the bug?</i> Interestingly, if we opened the 
    sixth character slot without resolving the bug, players would then be able 
    to use the bug to create a <i>seventh</i> character.&nbsp; We’d rather get out of 
    that loop, :D.</p>
    <p>Again, we apologize for the unexpected downtime and for the delay in the 
    opening of the new server. At the same time, we’re very excited to be able 
    to give our players a new character slot on all worlds two months earlier 
    than anticipated.</td>
