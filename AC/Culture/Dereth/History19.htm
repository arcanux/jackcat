    <span class="Head"><b>Frostfell PY 12 / Earth: January 2002 </b></span><br>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Shaken by the attacks of the previous month, 
    High Queen Elysa Strathelar's Guard was alert for more of Martine's attacks. 
    Believing their defense of the Nexus arrival towns of Holtburg, Shoushi, and 
    Yaraq to have been successful, the Guard was on the watch around these towns 
    for more subtle attacks. In the town of Holtburg, Sir Rylanan was 
    apprehensive of a supposedly reformed bandit living on the outskirts of 
    town. Around Yaraq, Dame Tsaya was alerted to the presence of a newcomer who 
    had moved into a previously abandoned villa. Sir Tenshin, the 
    recently-appointed head of the garrison in Shoushi, was informed of a town 
    resident who had begun to act strangely. Adventurers who answered the call 
    of the Queen's guards to investigate these matters followed a trail that 
    slowly uncovered a horrible plot to assassinate the Queen's son, Borelean. 
    Forewarned of this attack, Borelean was saved, but with the life of her son 
    threatened, Queen Elysa began to wonder how safe she and her son really 
    were. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">The attacks of the month of Frostfell also 
    prompted Nuhmudira to move farther along in her plans. She delved deeper 
    into dark magics, crossing a line from which she knew she could not return. 
    Through the sacrifice of human life, Nuhmudira opened up new pathways of 
    magic, infusing Isparian weapons with spells unknown before. These spells 
    work in conjunction with known magics, increasing the abilities of Isparians. 
    Nuhmudira hoped these spells would give the Isparians a better chance 
    against the Empyreans she was sure were returning. To salve her conscience, 
    Nuhmudira only sacrificed those whose crimes on Ispar and in Dereth are 
    brutal, but in the darkness a malevolent force smiled. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">There were some bright spots in the month of 
    Snowreap though, as the falling snows saw the return of the Giant Snowmen 
    not seen since the unnatural winter created by the Gelidites of Frore. Some 
    people wondered where these creatures had been hiding the last few years, 
    but the Snowman near Qalaba'r was little help in clearing up the mystery. In 
    the end, most decided that not everything in Dereth was part of a plot to 
    kill them and just enjoyed the atmosphere the Snowmen added to an otherwise 
    forlorn festival season. </font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the uncertain times, craftsmen continued 
    to build as quickly as they could to satisfy the demand of Isparians for 
    homes to call their own. Perhaps insecurity and doubt instilled in people a 
    need for a place of refuge and safety in a world that seemed increasingly 
    unsure. Even with these additional homes, demand was high and craftsmen knew 
    they would get little rest in the coming months.<br>
