    &quot;You can hear the murmurs in every tavern and around every lifestone. 
    Tension is building all across the land.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;As old age claims the last heroes who were enslaved to the Olthoi, we grow 
    complacent. We've relaxed our vigilance against threats from afar. And as 
    more people are called to Dereth, our settlements encroach on the 
    territories of other races. How can we not expect the dark denizens to 
    strike back?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Rumors from the frontiers suggest that more and more creatures are 
    threatening human habitations. How long will it be before they strike here? 
    How long before we must defend our homes?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And are we prepared?&quot;</font><p align="right"><font face="Arial" size="2">--Scribe ibn Tur</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    All over Osteth, mages have read the signs, and found the following 
    ill-starred towns under imminent threat:<br>
    Holtburg<br>
    Rithwic<br>
    Samsur<br>
    Shoushi<br>
    Yanshi<br>
    Yaraq<br>
    <br>
    We implore adventurers to begin gathering within distant sight of buildings 
    on the evening of Wednesday, July 7th, and guard the countryside and 
    inroads. Do not gather in the towns themselves -- we wish to intercept the 
    foe before they get so far! For political advantage and a mention in the 
    Annals, monarchs are advised to turn out with their allegiances. The hour of 
    trial is at hand; organize now!</font></p>

    Screenshots of the Call to Arms</a></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">By Auberon</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The advance scouts of the encroaching force appeared 
    around 5:30 P.M. Pacific Time, comprising lesser monougas and banderlings, 
    mixed with the occasional drudge pack. Holtburg was the first to encounter 
    banderlings, who made their initial assault near the menhir just outside of 
    town. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Soon other towns were under assault. Shoushi and Yanshi 
    witnessed several hard-fought early battles. Later in the day, Yaraq was 
    attacked by a huge swarm of monougas, who nearly decimated the population. A 
    nearby tumerok raiding band took the opportunity to attack, hoping to 
    pillage and plunder amid the general confusion. Between them and the 
    rampaging monougas, it looked as though monsters might overrun the town. 
    Fortunately, the stalwart citizens managed to regroup and form a defensive 
    line near the beach, thwarting the blitzkrieg invasion. The town of Rithwic 
    seemed at first to have escaped the onslaught, but soon ravenous hordes of 
    monsters descended on their homes as well. Holtburg and Samsur were also 
    struck by the host of invaders. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Citizen defenders gathered their allegiances to defend the 
    towns. Pockets of resistance formed and encountered the enemy on all fronts. 
    Mages and archers used the surrounding terrain, rampart walls, and building 
    terraces to good effect, while stalwart warriors engaged the enemy 
    hand-to-hand. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Rithwic, a Sho warrior, tired and wounded, spotted a 
    slim figure cutting her way through the ranks of enemies. There was a 
    familiar look to her fighting style. Elegant and precise, she reminded him 
    of the hero of the sacred rock. Could it be? By the gods, it was Ben Ten! 
    Once again, Ben Ten had appeared in Dereth's time of crisis to defend a 
    town, just like she did in Yanshi so many years before. Ben Ten's arrival 
    seemed to lift the spirits of the defenders, and the tide of battle turned 
    in favor of the Derethians. Soon Ben Ten was spotted in other areas of the 
    island. Through some mystical means, she seemed to gust in with the wind, 
    and where her blade shone, it laid waste to her opponents. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just as the people of Dereth felt they could breathe a 
    sigh of relief, a new and terrifying threat loomed. The tremendous monougas! 
    Towering over 40 feet tall, these colossal behemoths left a swathe of death 
    behind them. At first they appeared unstoppable, but the Derethians would 
    not be easily defeated. As the battle for Dereth raged, some spotted the 
    true source of the attack, the Virindi, who observed the battle with cold 
    calculation. Shadow Lieutenants were also sighted. Could the presence of 
    these minions of Bael'Zharon signify an unholy alliance between Virindi and 
    Dark Lord? The possible ramifications of such a union are horrifying to say 
    the least. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The battle ended around 8:30 P.M. Pacific Time, with 
    exhausted defenders counting the dead and healing the wounded. Although the 
    toll was terrible, the day had been won, and Dereth was safe for the moment. 
    As the citizenry return to their daily lives, they discuss the Call to Arms 
    as a grim reminder of the dangers of complacency. May we heed this lesson 
    well, for surely this will not be the last time we face the enemy.<br>

    <span class="Title2"><font face="Arial" size="2">Scavenger Hunt - June 1999</font></span></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By +Larn Margot<br>
	<br>
	It had been rumored that there would be a mysterious contest of skill and 
	bravery across the land of Dereth, and I, being a scribe, was naturally 
	interested. Bands of 10 to 20 brave men and women were meeting and forming 
	teams at towns all over the continent. I caught up with &quot;Team Three&quot; in the 
	swamps of Sawato. <br>
	<br>
	As the adventurers easily overwhelmed a red phyntos wasp, the rumbling of 
	thunder could be heard across the swamp. Ichi jin-rai searched the corpse 
	and found a pair of intact wings. &quot;I got a wasp wing. That's worth another 
	point . . .&quot; Ichi jin-rai said, when a mud golem crashed through the bushes, 
	running surprisingly fast for such a large monster. Two more of the 
	creatures soon followed. The rest of Team Three -- Elorian, Aslan the 
	Lionheart, and Jane the Brave -- easily slaughtered the golems, their bodies 
	crumbling to a thousand pieces. Following the battle, the relatively green 
	Aslan jumped with excitement, exclaiming, &quot;I've never seen a golem before!&quot; 
	However, after inspecting the remains of the creatures, the adventurers 
	seemed crestfallen. What were they hoping to find? <br>
	<br>
	During a brief respite from the fighting, I asked the nature of this 
	contest. It happened that Team Three was one of the eight registered bands 
	participating in a six-hour scavenger hunt. The objective was simple, if a 
	bit odd: collect monster body parts, medallions, and armor specified on a 
	public list and turn them over to an advocate for points before time ran 
	out. Of course, different items had different point values, ranging from the 
	one-point Auroch Horn to the thousand-point (not a misprint!) Olthoi 
	Cuirass. Perhaps the advocates needed these ingredients for a special spell. 
	Or perhaps this strange hunt was intended to encourage adventurers to 
	eliminate the evil creatures of Dereth. I do not know. Team Three was trying 
	hard not to get ambushed by golems in the process of collecting one-point 
	wasp wings. <br>
	<br>
	After the event, I discovered from an advocate that Team Four, consisting of 
	Vidorian (the leader), Jon, Draco, Blackthorn, Doremon, Kewlbreeze, and 
	Tobias, had achieved victory with a staggering 171 points. I sought them out 
	and discussed strategy with them. Kewlbreeze originally set his sights high. 
	&quot;I wanted to go for the Olthoi Cuirass at first =)&quot; he told me. However, Jon 
	convinced the team to &quot;stay with the easy stuff.&quot; Obviously the strategy 
	worked for Team Four, whose most valuable item was a swamp stone, worth a 
	lowly three points. Slow and steady seemed to be the key to the scavenger 
	hunt. No team brought in an item worth more than four points. <br>
	<br>
	Team Three, the team I was following, finished second. Perhaps their choice 
	of hunting ground had cost them victory. Soon after being attacked by the 
	golems, Ichi jin-rai was ambushed by two swamp gromnies. Jane the Brave 
	summed up the situation best when she exclaimed, &quot;RUN!&quot; This scribe was glad 
	he was not noticed by the gromnies (I bravely hid in the bushes). <br>
	<br>
	Congratulations to Team Four for their astounding success! <br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The world was about to end. Dereth was set to

	meticulously built up through weeks of blood (his blood), sweat (my sweat), 
	and tears (don't ask), was going to disappear forever. There were to be no 
	statues of Shreck in Arwic's town square, no mention of him in the history 
	books -- just “poof,” and he would be gone. <br>

	I had to bid farewell and get one last screenshot of the powerful warrior

	care for this video-game character? After all, I figured I was done with 
	Asheron's Call after this initial beta period. I'd spent too much time 
	building Shreck into a man who could stand on his own, and his death seemed 
	like a good excuse to avoid spending even more. <br>
	<br>
	I found Shreck standing in Arwic where I'd left him. There was no one else 
	around, and it was strangely silent. I set up and snapped the screenshot 
	beside the levitating blue gem that had delivered him so often to this 
	peaceful town, then, like any good warrior, turned to the blacksmith shop 
	for one last inspection to see if anyone had left some cool weapons behind.
	<br>
	<br>
	As I bellied up to the window, someone suddenly called to me. A character by 
	the name of Epsilon was asking if I knew where to find an Olthoi. He had 
	never seen one before and wanted to take one on before his character was 
	wiped. I told him there was one in the Arwic mines just a few steps away 
	through the portal. He asked if I could show him. I couldn't pass up one 
	last adventure, so off we went. <br>
	<br>
	His character was the same level as mine, and we had no problem dispatching 
	the pathetic drudges and zombies we found along the way through the 
	labyrinth. In no time at all, we'd come to the mist-filled hallways that had 
	earlier made me pause for fear of what was beyond. But Shreck was a 
	well-traveled warrior by now, and the Arwic mines were familiar, even 
	comfortable. Epsilon and I first took on a granite golem. In no time it was 
	pile of rocks -- we were invincible! Around the next turn we found the 
	Olthoi. Epsilon said he was impressed -- who wouldn't be? An Olthoi cuts an 
	imposing figure. Fortunately the Olthoi in the Arwic mines is a wounded one, 
	and with a few deft strokes from our swords we quickly put it out of its 
	misery. <br>
	<br>
	Apparently somewhat deflated by the ease with which we had put down this 
	otherwise impressive creature, Epsilon offered up another adventure. He knew 
	of a place on the coast where rumor had it an entire troop of Olthoi hung 
	out. The only Olthoi I had ever seen was the one we'd just carved up (and 
	its previous incarnations); I was eager to take on a fully charged soldier.
	<br>
	<br>
	We sailed across the countryside, passing all sorts of targets that, on a 
	normal day, I would've fought for experience points and treasures. But 
	accumulating experience was not our goal on this day. Epsilon and I were out 
	for pure, reckless fun. As we were dashing over hills and valleys on our way 
	to certain death, I was struck by how fun this game really is. I'd been a 
	solo adventurer for most of Shreck's development. Later I'd joined up with 
	friends and we traveled all over and fought hundreds of creatures. But this 
	was the first time I'd hooked up with a complete stranger. The spontaneity 
	of the adventure was the best part, and I realized then that Shreck had to 
	return to Asheron's Call, and this time he'd be much more sociable. <br>
	<br>
	Epsilon and I reached the Olthoi pack. They were a nasty bunch, none under 
	level 21. I drew off one officer and led him into our kill zone away from 
	the other baddies. It turned out to be the Olthoi's kill zone, however, 
	because in seven strikes of its claws I was rewarded with a free trip back 
	to Arwic. Epsilon was sent back to his lifestone soon after. We'd both died 
	in a matter of seconds, but we put some hurt on the officer. That was good 
	enough for both of us. <br>
	<br>
	We met up again and ventured on, but time was running out. The server wipe 
	was just 15 minutes away. I thought we'd end up saying good-bye to each 
	other, the servers would be shut down, and that'd be it. But we got a 
	message from the administrator telling us there was some sort of a meeting 
	in Glenden Wood. Epsilon and I decided to check it out. We contacted the 
	administrator asking for a shortcut to the gathering and in the blink of an 
	eye, he transported us both to the Glenden Wood common, where we were met by 
	a strange sight. There had to have been 50 or more characters standing about 
	one little area. Many of them were stripped practically naked. Weapons, 
	armor, and objects of all sorts were strewn about on the ground. At first I 
	thought everyone was gathered to ready themselves for a massive 
	player-killer battle. To my surprise and amusement, it turned out people had 
	stripped off their armor and possessions not to gear up with better 
	accoutrements for the big battle, but as an offering to the Asheron's Call 
	gods. This was a death party. I noticed there was a character in the center 
	of it all, a first-level priest created for this moment to give us all our 
	“last rites.” <br>
	<br>
	There was a tremendous amount of chatter. Keeping track of it all was almost 
	too much. Epsilon and I had to communicate with the “@tell” code just to be 
	able to pick each other out from the din. Everyone was taking screenshots of 
	this moment and asking all of us to pose -- straightforward shots of 
	characters in attack mode, and sillier staging with the emote codes like 
	“YMCA.” There was a lot of good humor in the group. I noticed one character 
	had stripped off all of his armor, then had set down all of his mana stones 
	and parchment in a perfect circle. He sat in the center of this shrine till 
	the end. <br>
	<br>
	In the last minutes, we were all watching our clocks and there were a lot of 
	good-byes as well as a lot of wisecracks. One guy yelled out “Hey, who stole 
	my wallet!” while some Stanley Kubrick fan called out “My God, it's full of 
	stars!” The priest had us all gather around and he gave us our last rites, 
	mixing passages from the Bible with lines from Star Trek. <br>
	<br>
	It was great to see all of these people in one place. I know it's just a 
	video game, but there was something very human in this final gathering in 
	which we were all about to watch our characters pass into oblivion. As the 
	final seconds ticked away, people were jumping, running, casting spells, 
	waving good-bye -- and the chatter reached a fever pitch. There were dozens 
	of farewell wishes and promises to meet again in the next life. Epsilon and 
	I will certainly meet up again and fight on in the new Dereth. <br>
	<br>
	I glanced up from the chat window for one final look around. No one was 
	moving. Everyone must have been busy typing in their messages, or so I 
	thought. I looked back down at the chat window -- nothing. The once-frantic 
	scrolling of messages had completely stopped. Yet all of the characters were 
	still gathered around the priest. Magical swords still sparkled, and I had 
	complete freedom of movement. It must have been server lag, I thought. I 
	walked around surveying the scene and suddenly felt like I was in an episode 
	of the Twilight Zone. Every character was frozen in place. It was eerie. I 
	called out, hoping someone could answer my question, “Why is everyone so 
	quiet?” The message registered in the chat window. Surely someone would 
	answer. No one did. It seemed Shreck had somehow been missed in the wipe and 
	was going to live on forever. I decided to turn away from this spooky scene. 
	I picked up a powerful sword someone had left behind, set Shreck on 
	auto-run, and headed off for another adventure. Ten paces out, the gods of 
	Asheron's Call caught up to me and sent me a final message: “Server 
	Connection Lost.” Dereth had disappeared and, “poof,” Shreck was gone. <br>
