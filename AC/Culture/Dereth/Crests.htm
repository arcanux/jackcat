      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ardry lurked in the bushes, closely observing
      his quarry, a high-ranking Tumerok. Up ahead, the Tumerok and its
      companions seemed to be conferring with a cloaked, sickle-wielding Virindi.
      Ardry noted with interest that one Tumerok carried a banner but he was
      unable to discern what device it displayed. After a few moments, the
      Virindi turned and created a portal, through which the Tumerok war party
      passed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Curiosity overcame his good judgment. When
      the Virindi turned away, Ardry leaped out of his concealment and ran for
      the portal. Trying to ignore his terror as the Virindi spun to look at
      him, Ardry leaped through the shimmering gateway, a fraction of a second
      before a fire bolt sizzled through the air.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a disorienting ride through the
      portal, Ardry opened his eyes in an unfamiliar Virindi installation, its
      twisted walls glowing red. “Don't recognize this place,” he muttered
      to himself. “Must be new? Uncle Aliester would be interested to know how
      far the Virindi have moved.” He made a note about the portal's location
      and began to explore the tunnels.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He wasn't able to explore for long. A group
      of Tumeroks noticed him and charged to attack. Unprepared to fight, he
      ran. Going purely on instinct, he sprinted through the twisting corridors,
      with more and more creatures picking up the pursuit. After a harrowing
      run, Ardry spotted the familiar pattern of a surface portal, the promise
      of escape.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ardry grinned, gritted his teeth and bolted
      through, sidestepping one last swinging sickle blade. He closed his eyes
      as he felt the familiar wrenching pull of portal energy, taking him back
      to the wide-open spaces of Dereth. But something was wrong. Instead of the
      sound of the wind in the forest, his ears were filled with an ominous,
      thrumming hum. He opened his eyes and found himself facing the blank stare
      of a Virindi. There was a flash, a burst of searing pain, and Ardry felt
      himself falling.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Please Note: </b>In this month's
      update, we have taken steps to reduce the perching that is currently
      happening in the Incunabula Vault. If you have a character on an obsidian
      pillar in the vault, it is advised that you move him/her before logging
      out prior to the update. You will no longer be able to stand on those
      pillars after the update. Those who are using them in the acid pit portion
      of the dungeon will fall down into the acid pit after the update. <b>Admins

      <img src="Chains/side_virindi.jpg" width="80" height="104" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With the passing of the summer Solstice,
      summer begins to fade into fall and the residents of Dereth find
      themselves locked in a struggle for survival. The Virindi continue to push
      further into Osteth, spreading the war to previously untouched
      locations--and this time, they are bringing new allies with them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Travelers from across Dereth report
      sightings of army encampments and pennants streaming out across the fields
      above fearsome bands. Fleeing before the advancing formations, some have
      also reported seeing strange floating citadels towering over the
      landscape.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the encroaching forces of the Virindi
      advance into the previously sheltered areas of Osteth, the lightning raids
      continue all across Dereth. Travelers seeking safety from the carnage find
      themselves traveling in large groups for defense. Yet even this tactic is
      no guarantee of survival, as the Virindi seem to hold no fear.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many months have passed with many perils
      overshadowing the people of Dereth. Yet they struggle on as their ranks
      are bolstered by stronger and wiser new arrivals. Old timers look on the
      bright-eyed newcomers and remember the trials and tribulations of their
      own arrivals so long ago. It's a good thing the new generations seem to be
      better equipped to handle life in this unforgiving realm.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not
      everything has been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      all manner of things added or changed! As usual, though, the town criers,
      barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of
      crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and features
      are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>
      <p><span class="Head"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Highlights include:</font></b></span>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Updated starting character templates
          equipment and spells are here. Newbie love abounds.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Increased weapon drop rates on low-level
          monsters.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Virindi continue their assault on
          the residents of Dereth, in spite of murderous losses inflicted by the
          defenders.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New weapon quests have arrived for the
          defenders of Dereth. Let the celebrations begin.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Summer has begun to fade but the cooler
      temperatures have not heralded a lessening of the Virindi assault. In
