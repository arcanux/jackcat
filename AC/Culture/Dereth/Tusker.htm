    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The shrill sound of metal scraping on metal 
    alerted the slumbering beast that its captor had returned. On the slab the 
    tusker squirmed, railing against the ribbons of energy that held its arms 
    and legs pinned to its sides. Aerbax floated toward his subject and bent his 
    head to inspect the area that would be the focus of his work this day.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Aerbax inspected his subject, a puppet 
    floated into view at the end of a dark corridor that oozed a heavy red film. 
    These new facilities were the latest of the Virindi's attempts to understand 
    the psyche of the Isparians. And while the rooms had been constructed to 
    mimic the interior of Isparian homes, Aerbax felt there was a flaw in the 
    process. Even though the weak minds of the Isparians often colored their 
    thoughts in hazy red mires, experimentation had shown that they were capable 
    of observing visible light in ways far beyond the dulling red that enveloped 
    their thoughts. When he had brought these observations to the attention of 
    the Quiddity, it had thought these ideas far too irrational and turned them 
    aside, and Aerbax accepted their will in this matter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even though his peers had spared Aerbax, 
    thinking that he could be reformed, they remained ever watchful for signs of 
    contamination, signs of individuality. He was familiar with what those 
    deemed mentally flawed had become, rendered into mindless puppets. Yet, 
    although almost infinitely powerful, the Quiddity still couldn't comprehend 
    the simplest concepts Aerbax had learned from the physical world—concepts 
    such as deception. The simple acceptance of the Quiddity's will in this 
    matter had been all that was required to return him to its trust, and he now 
    found himself back in Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Upon his return to Dereth, he had seen that 
    some of his former comrades, such as Levistras, were still clinging to their 
    concept of a new Singularity. At one time he had aided them in their quest, 
    but now he gave no thought to their plight. He was no fool; long before 
    Levistras had even achieved his supposed understanding of &quot;self,&quot; Aerbax had 
    been self-aware, and he could now see that resisting the will of the 
    Quiddity in this way was doomed to failure. No, for now he would use this 
    art of subterfuge he had mastered. He would not be dragged down with those 
    rebels when their attempt failed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He thought all this in the moment it took him 
    to form the scalpel he would need for the experiment. He looked down at the 
    tusker, and the large orange beast trembled in fear as much as rage. Aerbax 
    examined the edge of the scalpel to ensure it was sharp enough, then 
    examined the sloped brow of the creature. He focused his attention on the 
    area where the hair had been stripped clear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He looked into the creature's eyes and forced 
    the mouth on his mask to curl upwards at the ends. He had seen the Isparians 
    change the skin on their faces like this, and it seemed appropriate now. He 
    sensed the emotion the Isparians called fear in the creature, so he tried to 
    soothe it with the words he had heard the Isparians use on their offspring.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Worry not my son, the pain will last only as 
    long as the process takes.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the scalpel, he cut effortlessly through 
    the scalp and skull of the tusker, fusing tissue closed and leaving dollops 
    of purple congealed blood along the incision. The tusker wailed and pulled 
    against the restraints, but Aerbax continued. Finally a section of the 
    tusker's skull fell onto the slab with an audible thump. The puppet watched 
    as Aerbax shook his head and mumbled, &quot;This will take more effort than 
    expected.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Oolutanga grunted and stirred, the rough assemblage of bamboo he called a 
    throne creaking under his weight. His dream had come again, but stronger and 
    in more detail than he had yet experienced. As he sat pondering it, a guard, 
    awakened by the creaking of the throne, made its way over to him,. The guard 
    grunted inquisitively, asking if everything was all right. Oolutanga began 
    grunting a reassurance to the guard that everything was fine, then cut 
    himself short. He suddenly realized what the dreams meant—the Masked God had 
    returned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Summon the hero,&quot; he grunted to the tusker, 
    &quot;I, who am Oolutanga, will not see us slaves of the Masked God again.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">December</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">, 
      2002</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is a time of reconstruction and 
      rebuilding for the people of Dereth. Few can forget the scene of Arwic's 
      destruction, when one of Bael'Zharon's Spires reduced it to a smoking 
      crater. Yet even after the defeat of Bael'Zharon and the disappearance of 
      the Spire beneath the ground, the people had refused to rebuild.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, after spending months surveying and 
    erasing the craters created by the devastation, the Arcanum builders, under 
    the direction of High Queen Elysa, have finally rebuilt the town of Arwic. 
    Soon after the last nail is hammered in, many of the former residents of 
    Arwic move back in, happy to move out of their makeshift &quot;New'ic.&quot; Adding to 
    their joy are rumors that the Arcanum has more in store for Arwic. Yet a few 
    dissenting voices can be heard, those who question the wisdom of rebuilding 
    the town in the same location where such a heinous attack once occurred.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, students of Nuhmudira have been 
    appearing in the various towns, requesting the aid of the townspeople in 
    their studies. Although no longer associated with the Arcanum, Nuhmudira has 
    taken on students from the various races, including the Aun Tumeroks and 
    Lugians of Linvak Tukal. These students say that she has been bringing their 
    unique disciplines and abilities to bear on the objects that are currently 
    consuming her studies: the Lifestones. Although these objects preserve the 
    lives of all the people of Dereth, they remain a mystery to those whose 
    lives depend on them. In light of the past year's events, her students say 
    Nuhmudira is convinced that they must unravel the Lifestones' secret and 
    perhaps even find means to create Lifestones themselves. Then they can be 
    truly confident that Dereth is their land.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elsewhere, on the island of Aphus Lassel, new 
    mysteries have also been uncovered, as the leader of the &quot;free&quot; Tuskers has 
    been reportedly found. Supposedly he will grant magnificent boons to those 
    who approach him, but only after they prove themselves in combat. The 
    stories tell that this challenge is not easy, so only the most skilled 
    warriors have even a hope of facing the Tusker King's challenge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gifts and dangers abound…</font></p>

    Changes</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mansion owners can no longer swear their 
      allegiance to anyone else. If they do want to swear allegiance to someone 
      else, they must first abandon their mansion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The treasure system has been enhanced in a 
      number of small ways to make treasure more useful and &quot;fun.&quot; Please see 
      the <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/Letter_12-02.htm">Letter 
      to the Players</a> for more details.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New Maces with 325 wield requirements can 
      now be generated with a maximum damage of 34.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dirks (higher base damage daggers) can now 
      be found in the game. These dirks can be found with and without wield 
      requirements, similar to those found on many other weapons. They can also 
      be tinkered and imbued, but cannot be hilted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Multi-strike weapons have received a few 
      slight changes. For more information, please see the
      <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/Letter_12-02.htm">Letter to 
      the Players</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer imbue hilted weapons. Any 
      hilted weapons that were imbued will revert to their previous status and 
      will no longer be imbued.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When introducing the skill sellback quests, 
      we applied a limit of 50 skill credits to the number of skill credits that 
      could be spent on specializing skills. This limit included both the cost 
      to train and specialize skills. Unfortunately, the full skill credit cost 
      of racial skills was being applied against that limit, so many players 
      could not specialize skills that they theoretically should have been able 
      to. This has been corrected.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously if the game tried to create a 
      corpse in an especially tight place, the physics of the corpse might 
      prevent it from being created. This would result in all the items on the 
      corpse falling to the ground. We've changed this behavior so that a corpse 
      is always created for players and monsters (with the exception of monsters 
      that do not leave a corpse behind).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The level restrictions on the dungeons 
      where Tusker tusks can be found have been modified so that more characters 
      have access to the tusks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Impious Staff quest is now repeatable 
      every 30 days. The broken Impious Staff is now spawning ever 5 minutes, as 
      opposed to the 30-minute rate at which it was spawning previously.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The fires are out in Yanshi, but with the 
      Harbinger's spirit rumbling below, the townspeople are too scared to 
      rebuild!</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Minor Details</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The percentage chance of finding more than 
      one enchantment on jewelry and clothing has been increased.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hooked singularity weapons should be 
      hanging correctly now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Rithwic Grocer buys lock picks and 
      books once again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer play chess against 
      yourself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Tusker tusk used in the &quot;The Horn of 
      Vigilance&quot; quest has been renamed to remove any confusion between it and 
      the tusks found on Tuskers in the various Aphus Lassel dungeons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the past, if a newly created character 
      started with a burden over 300%, they would fail to receive their default 
      spells. These heavily burdened characters will now receive their spells.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the December edition of the <em>
      Asheron's Call</em> Letter to the Players. The AC Live team hopes that you 
      are enjoying the winter season, both in-game and out. We are changing the 
      date when we release the Letter to the Players. While the Dev Notes and 
      Teasers pertain to content in the monthly release, we want to use the 
      Letter of the Players to tell you about issues relating to the game as a 
      whole. It'll be our way of providing more regular communication, instead 
      of sending out a whole lot of info just once a month. We've got quite a 
      bit to discuss this month, so let's get started.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Client Download:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many of our astute players will notice a 
    change with this month's update—you won't be downloading a new client. 
    Normally with an update, you first download an updated client via the Zone, 
    and then use the client to download the updated data files (such as the 
    portal.dat). However, because of holiday scheduling difficulties, we decided 
    to skip the client download this month. Don't worry—this doesn't impact the 
    new content for the month in any way, and your old client will still 
    download the updated data files as usual. Client downloads will resume in 
    January.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Server Issues:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the past two months, the worlds of 
    Asheron's Call have experienced intermittent server issues. These issues 
    affect players in a variety of ways, but often result in failures to 
    teleport or extreme lag followed by a disconnect. Often, when the player 
    attempts to log back in, she receives the message that her character is 
    still in the world. She may be able to log in other characters, but cannot 
    log in the one that is &quot;stuck&quot; until the incident is resolved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The AC Live team takes this issue quite 
    seriously, and we have been working around the clock to try and solve this 
    problem. We have introduced several server optimizations that have succeeded 
    in reducing the severity, if not the frequency, of these incidents, and we 
    continue to do everything in our power to ensure a speedy—and 
    permanent—resolution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We appreciate your patience with us while we 
    work on this. We also understand that it's frustrating to not be able to log 
    into the game with your favorite character. This is a frustrating issue for 
    us as well. When you begin to experience problems, we encourage you to use 
    Urgent Assistance to let the Admins know, but please understand that there 
    are likely many other players who are also experiencing the same problems, 
    so you may not receive a personal answer. Be assured, however, that the 
    Admins are working to get you and the other players fixed up and able to 
    play again as quickly as possible, and to get us as much information as 
    possible to help us fix this issue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Allegiance Housing:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It came to our attention last month that some 
    players were using the mechanics of mansions in order to maintain a mansion 
    even when they were not the monarch of an allegiance. This is not intended 
    behavior—buying a mansion is quite specifically limited to monarchs—and 
    because mansions are a fairly limited resource, we want to make sure 
    mansions are not being held by non-monarchs. So this month we are 
    introducing a small change to the process of swearing allegiance: If you own 
    a mansion, you will be unable to swear allegiance to another character until 
    you abandon your mansion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Multi-Strike Weapons:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">December has several bits of news involving 
    multi-strike weapons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, we discovered a bug last month that 
    allowed players to imbue bandit-hilted weapons with the magic item tinkering 
    effects Critical Strike, Crippling Blow, and Armor Rending. This wasn't 
    intended behavior, and we have fixed this problem with the December update. 
    In December, it is once again true that hilted weapons can't be tinkered or 
    imbued, and that imbued or tinkered weapons can't be hilted. Any hilted 
    weapons that have been imbued as a result of the bug will revert to an 
    unimbued status with the December update. For example, if you have a 
    Critical Strike Bandit Yaoji in November, then after the December update you 
    will have a plain Bandit Yaoji.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second bit of news in December for 
    multi-strike weapons involves the skill levels you need to multi-strike. In 
    order to bring multi-strike weapons more in line with the wield requirement 
    system, the requirements for double- and triple-strike are changing 
    slightly, as outlined in the following table. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And finally, the quest timer for obtaining a 
    bandit weapon has been reduced. After the December update, you will be able 
    to obtain a bandit hilt once per month, instead of once every four months.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Dirks:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The December update contains the addition of 
    a new type of dagger: the dirk. Dirks have a higher base damage than 
    previous types of daggers, and the highest levels of damage come paired with 
    wield requirements. The variance of dirks found in treasure may also vary. 
    Dirks can be tinkered and imbued as normal, but they cannot be bandit 
    hilted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Treasure Tweaks:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In last month's Letter to the Players, we 
    mentioned that we would soon be evaluating the treasure tables in order to 
    reduce the amount of, well, useless junk is all we can call it, that is 
    created by the system. The December update includes the first of these 
    changes. The only item that was completely removed from the treasure tables 
    was parchment (yes, you scribes are going to have to buy your parchment from 
    shops now), but we did shape up the treasure tables in several other ways:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Parchment no longer drops as loot. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Creatures no longer drop their pitiful 
      unmutated weapons. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Missile weapon ammunition (i.e., arrows, 
      crossbow bolts, and atlatl darts) no longer drops as loot. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Foods now only drop at low treasure 
      levels. At higher levels, food has been replaced with potions. This does 
      not affect special food drops, like fire auroch meat or spices. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More types of scarabs (e.g., lead, iron, 
      copper) drop at lower levels of loot. At higher levels of loot, scarabs 
      have been replaced with scarab peas. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Weapon damage, variance, offense and 
      defense modifiers, and speed now mutate more often. In addition, weapon 
      burden can now mutate as well. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The armor level and burden on armor 
      mutates more often. In addition, the elemental protection of shields can 
      mutate. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Jewelry now has a chance to be generated 
      with heritage requirements.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Future:</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many players have written to tell us that 
    they really enjoyed the update to the Lethe quest, and to ask if we have any 
    other quest updates in mind for the future. As it happens, we do, and you'll 
    see the first of them in the December update. (Here's a hint: if you have 
    low level characters near Holtburg, you may want to be careful where you log 
    them out before the update.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also get many questions about additional 
    tinkering effects, including more items that can be used with ivory. 
    Although the December update does not include these things, rest assured 
    that we have plans for the future for more tinkering effects, more imbued 
    effects, and more ivory targets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You'll notice that this Letter does not 
    include details about the upcoming tweaks to Life Magic. We haven't given up 
    on Life Magic! But we feel that this is one area in which being 
    conservative, and play-testing our changes extensively, is especially 
    important. So we are taking our time and making sure that we understand the 
    implications of our changes for all types of characters. And that means that 
    these tweaks are not yet ready for the live worlds. We will give you more 
    information on the planned changes as it becomes available. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, that's not all that we have in 
    store for you in the future, but for the any updates on content, you'll just 
    have to wait and see… As always, enjoy the game, and thank you for playing
