    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>600 Years Before<br>
    </em>Winds laden with rancid spores assaulted the skyship, causing it to 
    lurch to the right. Asheron gripped the gunwale and marveled at the sight of 
    rats, desperate to find shelter, scurrying between his legs into holes in 
    the deck no wider than the length of his finger. The winds abated in 
    intensity for a moment, and Asheron made his way on unsteady legs to the 
    door of Emperor Kellin's cabin. As he pushed the door open, the winds grew 
    in strength again and the door swung open wildly, striking the wall of the 
    cabin and startling the Emperor and his three advisors. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What do you want, plague-bringer?&quot; Kellin 
    barked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Plague-bringer? Is that what you call me 
    now?&quot; Asheron spat back. &quot;I am no more a bringer of plague than you are the 
    cultivator of the disease, Kellin.&quot; His tone sarcastic, he continued, &quot;Look 
    about you! The ancient and glorious seaborne empire of Yalain has been 
    shattered. There is no one here to impress save your attendants who still 
    wag their sly tongues, reaffirming your value to the Yalain.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron could see the rage building in Kellin, 
    but too much had happened to waste time on pretense in their discussion. The 
    threat of one of Nali Valind inquistions no longer had any power over 
    Asheron; even had she not escaped to Ireth Lassel, Kellin simply couldn't 
    afford to expose the secret of Asheron's long life. Asheron was the most 
    learned among them and the only one who had any hope of stemming this tide 
    of Darkness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron allowed a moment to pass in silence, 
    then spoke firmly as he saw the Emperor about to say something. &quot;I have come 
    with a directive.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You are in no position to make demands of 
    the Throne, Asheron.&quot; Kellin retorted, attempting to save face. The advisors 
    remained silent, seemingly in awe of the aged and wizened Asheron.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; Asheron snapped back. 
    &quot;This ship must be taken to Knorr.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Are you mad? Knorr? The place where the 
    Olthoi first made their mark upon the world?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Seat of Knorr houses my father's 
    research,&quot; Asheron responded quickly. His barbed tone had not changed since 
    entering these chambers. &quot;That research is vital if I am to find a cure for 
    the Olthoi plague. We must collect that information, and soon, else this 
    world crumble and your Throne with it.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A long, tense moment passed. Finally, Kellin 
    relented. &quot;See it done, old one.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>The Present</em><br>
    Once an example of the greatest works of the Empyrean, Arikas, the Warden of 
    Knorr, was now but an abject reminder of a lost age. Once a glorious work of 
    magical art with smoothly jointed arms and legs, hands with cleverly 
    articulated fingers, and a finely carved face, Arikas was now only a 
    misshapen, barely functional form. But though the long years had worn away 
    the majesty of the golem, Asheron could tell that its mind was still very 
    much whole.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Arikas, are the conveyances intact?&quot; Asheron 
    asked, as he pulled the point of an Olthoi pincer free from the golem.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Conveyances are functional, Lord Master 
    Asheron, though the number of life forms categorized 'Olthoi' are great. 
    Twenty-two conveyances from the seat of Knorr are functional, only four have 
    been destroyed, Colleg—&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron broke into Arikas' speech. &quot;Thank you 
    Arikas. You have done well here.&quot; He pulled another bit of pincer free from 
    the Warden. &quot;I am here to collect more of my writings. Perhaps, in another 
    hundred years or so, we shall open the halls of Knorr again.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;That would be most welcome, Lord Master 
    Asheron.&quot;</font></p>

    edition of the Asheron's Call Letter to the Players. Our weather here in 
    Boston has warmed up nicely; we hope that yours has, as well. Spring has 
    sprung in Dereth–flowers are blooming, the bunnies are hopping (and still 
    breeding like crazy, the little devils), and the future is looking bright. 
    But there are hints that something is badly amiss, and dark signs behind the 
    splendid flowering…</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But before we get into that, let's discuss 
    the major changes in store for May.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>The Jump-Spin Maneuver</strong><br>
    <br>
    The jump-spin maneuver is one that most player killers are familiar with; 
    it's a very simple maneuver with considerable impact on player vs. player 
    gameplay. When a PK is being pursued by a melee PK and the pursuing melee is 
    in &quot;sticky&quot; combat mode–that is, being dragged along behind the fleeing 
    player and striking them in the back–the fleeing player can jump and spin in 
    midair. If the fleeing player executes the maneuver correctly, the pursuing 
    player's client will become confused, breaking sticky mode and often 
    freezing up for a short time, thus allowing the fleeing player time to 
    escape. Although there is an element of player skill to using this maneuver, 
    we've found that the use of jump-spin negates too many of the other elements 
    of PK gameplay in Asheron's Call. So we decided to do something about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first thing we did was investigate why 
    jumping and spinning in midair has this effect on the pursuing player's 
    client. If we could prevent this effect, our problem was solved. 
    Unfortunately, we found that the 'confused client' effect is a deeply 
    embedded side effect of the way our client interpolates movement. In short, 
    the server controls where your character actually is, but in order to reduce 
    the effects of Internet latency the client makes a guess about where it 
    expects you will be in the near future. During the jump-spin maneuver, the 
    client becomes excessively confused about where your target is and thus 
    about where you are trying to go, and locks up until it gets correct 
    information back from the server. The code for this system is extremely 
    complicated and not amenable to tweaking, so we realized that we would have 
    to look elsewhere for a 'fix' for jump-spin. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next approach we tried was to change the 
    behavior of &quot;charging.&quot; (There are more details about what charging means 
    below, under &quot;Optional Charge Attacks.&quot;) During testing, we noticed that 
    when jump-spin was used, the pursuing character would usually see the &quot;You 
    have charged too far!&quot; message just as their client became confused and 
    froze up. Perhaps, we thought, if we could change the charging behavior we 
    could avoid the client confusion. Unfortunately, playtesting showed that 
    although modifying the charge behavior sometimes works, it more often causes 
    even more client confusion, sometimes locking up the client for minutes at a 
    time. On the other hand, the modified charge behavior was pretty handy for 
    player vs. monster play, and so we retained the change as an option as 
    outlined below in &quot;Optional Charge Attacks.&quot; Please note, however, that we 
    do not recommend turning off charge attacks during PK gameplay because of 
    the increased risk of jump-spin client confusion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, if changing charge attack behavior didn't 
    solve our problem, what would? We next examined a suggestion that had been 
    prominent in player feedback on this issue–increase the stamina penalty for 
    jumping during a PK battle. Initially we felt that this type of solution was 
    no more than a band-aid that did not properly address the underlying 
    problem, but the more we thought about it–and the more feedback we read from 
    PK fans–the more we felt that this could be a viable counter-measure to 
    jump-spin. Through extensive play testing, we determined that this extra 
    penalty should range from 100 stamina for a little hop to 200 stamina for a 
    full-power leap. In addition, this increased penalty only applies to PK 
    players who have given or received a successful PK attack within the past 20 
    seconds. Notice that this is not a &quot;fix&quot; for the jump-spin maneuver; rather, 
    it is a counter-measure that we believe will moderate the use of jump-spin 
    and other jumping maneuvers in PK combat, and indeed increase the amount of 
    strategy involved. We will be monitoring the effects of this change very 
    closely and we will tweak it or remove it altogether if that seems 
    appropriate.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Optional Charge Attacks<br>
    </strong><br>
    What is a charge attack? When a player executes a melee attack, they first 
    move towards their target until they are within range to attack. This 
    movement is a charge–it is much faster than the character's normal movement 
    rate, but because of that speed it can only be sustained for a very short 
    distance. If, at the end of the charge, the player is still too far away 
    from their target to attack, they will stop the attack and see the message, 
    &quot;You have charged too far!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As mentioned above, we were fiddling with the 
    behavior of charge attacks while looking for a solution to the jump-spin 
    issue. During this process we added an option that allows players to turn 
    off charge attacks. When charge attacks are turned off and the player 
    executes a melee attack, they move toward their target at their normal 
    movement speed and they don't stop until they get there. (Actually, they 
    will stop eventually, but the movement allows enough distance to reach 
    anything within range of the radar.) This turned out to be so handy for PvM 
    gameplay that we retained the option for all players. To toggle this option, 
    look in your Character Options panel for Use Charge Attacks. This option is 
    on (checked) by default and provides the old &quot;charge&quot; behavior. Unchecking 
    the option provides the new &quot;run until you get there&quot; behavior. Note that 
    neither of these behaviors affect ranged attacks.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>The Weapons of Palenqual (a.k.a. the Rubble Quest)</strong><br>
    <br>
    With the May update, we are streamlining the mechanics of the rubble 
    quest–the ACDM quest that rewards players with the Stave, Hoeroa, or 
    Kalindan of Palenqual. The rubble quest is intimately tied into the Olthoi 
    Queen's quest; originally, these two quests together were meant to provide 
    an avenue for players to dynamically control a portion of the world. Players 
    who were working with the Hea Tumeroks could break the menhir rings, 
    strengthening the Olthoi, while players who were working with the Aun 
    Tumeroks could gather rubble to repair the menhir rings. If the Hea-allied 
    players succeeded in breaking all the menhirs, the Aun-allied players would 
    then need to go and defeat the Olthoi Queen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That, at least, was the theory. In reality, 
    because there are interesting rewards associated with each quest, players 
    rarely role-play the opposing factions. Instead, they work together to 
    schedule both quests so that everyone can get the rewards. This sort of 
    cooperation is always heartening to see in an online community. 
    Unfortunately, even working together there are many obstacles and annoyances 
    in the path of anyone attempting to complete the rubble quest and so until 
    now that quest remained fairly unpopular. We hope, however, that the May 
    modifications will renew interest in this quest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The existing mechanics of the Queen's quest 
    and the rubble quest are not changing in any way, so players who do wish to 
    dynamically control a portion of the world through role-playing may continue 
    to do so. If, however, you merely wish to get your weapon of Palenqual 
    without torturous quest scheduling, you can now give the various tokens and 
    bits of rubble to new student Tumeroks in Timaru without affecting the 
    progress of the Queen's quest. In addition, the quest becomes repeatable in 
    May, and the rewards have been upgraded slightly.<br>

    <strong>The Story: May and Beyond</strong><br>
    <br>
    May also marks the beginning of our next major story arc: A Time of Chaos. 
    Although the ongoing story that sets Asheron's Call apart has continued 
    since the end of the Gaerlan arc last September, it has perhaps not been as 
    clear and obvious as players had come to expect. However, with the beginning 
    of this new arc, the truth can no longer be hidden, and the machinations of 
    a number of major actors–villains and heroes alike–are about to come to 
    light. But more ominous than any threat in Dereth are the rumblings beneath 
    the surface, the rousing of a menace we thought we had defeated…</font><br>
