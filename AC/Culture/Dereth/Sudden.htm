    <i>Atop a hill overlooking Zaikhal, Asaina al-Arqis placed a crystal apparatus 
    on the ground, aligning it to the setting sun. The light caught within its 
    facets, held, and the delicate mechanism began to gently spin. She frowned 
    and tapped the base of the device. Over the past three days, the portents 
    had been clear. Portal runners from Hebian-To and Cragstone confirmed it: 
    the temperature was slowly, steadily falling, and showed no signs of 
    stopping . . . </i> </font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first major event in the 
	world of Asheron's Call will take place in early December. Players marvelled 
	at the widespread changes in the world during the &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; event at 
	the end of beta -- meteors ravaged the continent, weird new creatures 
	appeared, and a fragmented prophesy puzzled thousands. Though not as 
	apocalyptic in nature, this event will continue our commitment to having a 
	major event every month, advancing and developing the story of Dereth, and 
	giving players new challenges. Some of these developments follow a plotline 
	covering many months. Great things are yet to come! We look forward to 
	experiencing them with you.<br>

    <i>Atop the dune, under the feeble sunset light, Asaina al-Arqis hugged her 
    thick cloak around her, blew into her hands, and bent and replaced the gem 
    at the apex of her sensing apparatus. Sunlight glinted from the facets, sank 
    within, then struck a violent spark at the center. With a crack the light 
    winked out, the supporting wires loosed their hold, and the suddenly gray 
    stone fell beside the last two she'd tested. She could not calibrate the 
    equipment any finer, but she knew enough. A week, perhaps, probably less, 
    and even the desert would freeze. It was time to give a final report to the 
    Council. </i></font></p>
	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Expect impressive developments 
	by the end of next week, including a world-spanning quest and a range of 
	holiday festivals. To get some idea of the scope of a major Asheron's Call 
	event, we invite you to check out coverage of the &quot;Fire in the Sky &quot; from 
	the end of beta. Next week will be just the first of the large-scale events 
	we'll roll out every month. We look forward to sharing all the excitement 
	with you in this next great adventure!<i><br>

    <i>Murmurs and coughs faded from the Council chamber as the four-foot column of 
    enchanted ice drained candlelight from the room. &quot;Here is yet another 
    image,&quot; said Asaina al-Arqis to the assembly. &quot;This is what the shard 
    foresees for Qalaba'r.&quot; The stolen light resolved into a view of the 
    familiar desert town, but it could hardly be recognized: snow was in the air 
    and lay thick on the ground. &quot;It is time to prepare. Mark me -- tomorrow, 
    the view outside your own windows will be very much the same.&quot; </i>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a name="update"></a>Details of 
		the 11/23/1999 Update - From the 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEnewsupdate1.asp">Zone</a></small></font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">On the morning of November 23rd, Asheron's Call 
	will undergo its first major update since its public debut. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This update makes some changes to game 
	balance -- the relative strengths of particular skills, monsters, and items. 
	We realize that changes can be painful, and we have no intention of 
	continually shifting the game balance. We are especially reluctant to make 
	changes that weaken characters. However, we badly needed to curtail the 
	effectiveness of a few skills for this update to put them on equal footing 
	with most of the game's other skills. We do not change the character powers 
	lightly, and we do not intend to make this a common practice. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Below are details on the changes, from Chris 
	Foster, lead game designer for Asheron's Call at Turbine Entertainment 
	Software. </font>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">CHANGES TO MONSTERS</font></b><font size="2">
	</font></font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Monsters now have more pronounced &quot;soft 
		spots&quot; in their armor. Choosing the height of your missile and melee 
		attacks will have a more pronounced effect on the damage you do. </font>
		</li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Monsters now also have clearer &quot;soft 
		spots&quot; in their magical resistances. Mages must choose spells more 
		carefully; using a spell to which a monster has natural resistance can 
		reduce its effectiveness by half or more! Mages who choose proper 
		spellcasting tactics will do as much damage as they ever did. </font>
		</li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Lugians, Armordilloes, and Gromnies are 
		somewhat faster and better defended. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Lugians and some Monougas fit better 
		through doorways. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The locations of many monsters have been 
		tweaked to improve game balance. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Vats and braziers are now ethereal, so 
		they cannot be used as safe &quot;perches&quot; for picking off monsters. </font>
		</li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">On the landscape, monsters will now be 
		able to open doors. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Gromnies will no longer defend their 
		brethren. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Shadow creatures and Olthoi have better 
		defenses. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Many Monougas will navigate better 
		around pits. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Banderling Captains and Tumerok Warriors 
		were not casting spells; this now works as intended. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Ice golems no longer take double damage 
		from fire. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">CHANGES TO MAGIC</font></b><font size="2">
	</font></font>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Portal spells are now harder to learn, 
		and the spread in difficulty across portal spreads is also greater. 
		(This restores portal magic as a goal to which mages aspire.) </font>
		</li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The ranges of Harm and Drain spells have 
		been reduced, as the ranges made these attack spells more powerful than 
		anything a War Mage could cast. Beneficial Heal, Regenerate and 
		Enchantment spells retain their high range. The duration of enchantment 
		now increases substantially with the level of its spell. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Vendors no longer hold on to the magic 
		scrolls they buy, and will only sell their standard supplies of them.
		</font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Minor tweaks: Health-to-Stamina Self II 
		had the wrong scarab, and the Range for Exhaustion Other I was too 
		short. Both will be fixed. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Health-to-Stamina Other spells did not 
		display their range when examined. They will now. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">QUEST ITEMS</font></b><font size="2">
	</font></font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Changes have been made to the requirements 
	for using the following items: </font></p>

	</ul>
	<font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">MISCELLANEOUS</font></b><font size="2">
	</font></font>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Miscellaneous portals now have 
		appropriate level restrictions. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A small number of traps, locks, and 
		quest-related items have been tweaked. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Mattekar hides are now less commonplace.
		</font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The values of jewelry created by the 
		treasure system have been made more consistent. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of locations where players can 
		get stuck in or behind objects are fixed. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of minor tweaks have been made 
		to spell effects and other graphics. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of rumors have been clarified 
		and/or corrected. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of quest-related and 
		collector-related behaviors have minor fixes. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Ale and green tea now work as intended.
		</font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Healing cheese&quot; is now labeled 
		everywhere it appears. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Minor tweaks have been made to improve

    Season&quot; Has Arrived! - </span>December 16, 1999</b><br>
    <br>
    The forecasts have proven true! Yesterday, like all the days before, the 
    snow gleamed only on Dereth's far-off peaks, stark, clean, and unattainable, 
    a symbol of impossible quests. But this morning, Derethians from Holtburg to 
    the sub-tropical reaches of the southernmost Sho and Gharu'ndim lands awoke 
    to find snow falling outside their windows. During the intermittent breaks, 
    the sun beat feebly in the frosty sky. The first adventurers to explore this 
    strange wonderland were startled by crude snowmen that materialized in a 
    swirl of ice -- only to cast beneficial enchantments on them. Taking these 
    kindly creatures as a good omen, citizens declared a holiday vigil for the 
    sun to regain its strength, and have put aside their usual activities to 
    invent food recipes and create festive robes, candles, and paper lanterns.<br>
    <br>
    However, many sages are studying the situation under grave doubt, fearing 
    some baleful magic is at work. In every town, criers announce that the team 
    of Sir Joffre Tremblant, who sought a fabled mountain city, is overdue to 
    return. Scouts ranging far afield have brought back reports of new snowmen 
    of nasty disposition and even a few of gigantic size. Meanwhile, the world 
    grows colder still ...<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Other News<br>
    </b><br>
    Balancing out their disturbing news, town criers have been happily 
    announcing the start of traditional holidays for each heritage group (the 
    Aluvian Solstice, the Gharu'ndim Night Feast, and the Sho Festival of Lights 
    -- details can be gleaned from Asheron's Lore). They also declared a cooking 
    contest!<br>

    From Turbine - </span>December 16, 1999</b></font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Highlights of the Update on December 16, 1999 </b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    On December 16, Asheron's Call had its second major update. In addition to 
    heralding our first event and the beginning of our ongoing storyline, this 
    update includes a number of changes that affect game balance. None of these 
    will affect any one profession to the degree of our previous alterations to 
    magic. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Listed here are those items that we think are 
    of most interest to players. If you want to read about every single tiny 
    change we've made, look in the News section of the Zone AC Web pages on the 
    Zone for an article titled &quot;Build Notes, December 16.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Event Changes: </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Half the fun of the &quot;Sudden Season&quot; event is discovering for yourself what 
    has been added or changed, so no details are listed here. There's much more 
    than just some snow on the ground! Ask around, read the news, and explore.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Monster AI Changes: </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    We've made a number of changes to how monster AI works, in the interests of 
    making them behave a bit more intelligently. While there are limits to what 
    we can do to improve AI in the short term, we will be watching the results 
    of these changes carefully, to see how they fare. </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters will react more sensibly to 
      occasional &quot;issued attacks,&quot; and will not break off their attacks as 
      quickly. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters who fail to hit you with 
      projectile attacks will continue attacking with non-projectile &quot;harm&quot; 
      spells, if they have them. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters will tend to &quot;stick&quot; to their 
      targets more consistently, and &quot;waffle&quot; less frequently between targets.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters now are less fixated on getting 
      extra-close to their target before making a melee attack. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters were failing to cast spells on 
      themselves, due to a bug. Argh! Monsters are less dumb now. (Our own 
      mental faculties, on the other hand, remain unchanged.) </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Monster Balance: </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Banderlings and Black Drudges now cast 
      more slowly. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Golems in general had Magic Defense that 
      was too low for their level -- making them easy sources of XP. This has 
      been changed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Skeletons have higher levels, to reflect 
      their challenge. (We'll probably do the same soon for Mountain Rats, but 
      they kill us every time we mention the idea . . .) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lugians can now throw boulders faster and 
      farther than before. Duck! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There were small glitches in the data for 
      some types of Gromnies, Drudges, Armoredillos, Golems, Olthoi, Mu-miyah 
      and Virindi, which gave each of them inordinately low or high protection 
      against a specific damage type. These have been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Magma Golems have been learning from the 
      mages that attack them . . . </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Vendor Changes: </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Vendors can now buy back all expensive 
      trade notes that they sell; this was a glitch. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aqua Incanta and Neutral Balm are now 
      available with many more vendors. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of bowyers should have sold 
      fletching items, but didn't. They do now. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now sell cooking items to grocers. 
      Stop abandoning all those sides of beef, kids! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Vendors (particularly Kuro of Kara) were 
      buying some inappropriate items. This has been fixed. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Magic Balance: </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Imperil Other can now be defended using 
      the Magic Defense skill. This was a glitch. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players were using portal magic to provide 
      &quot;short-cuts&quot; through quests. Now, critical portals within quests are set 
      so that they cannot be &quot;tied&quot; using portal spells. This does not affect 
      any other portals. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scroll for Acid Bane 6 no longer 
      teaches Acid Bane 5. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Changes: </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In some rare cases, the client could 
      freeze or crash when you were wielding items or otherwise manipulating 
      your inventory. This should be fixed now. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Corpses now decay much more quickly when 
      they are empty. This minimizes clutter on the landscape, which in extreme 
      cases can cause slowdowns. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A glitch in the treasure system was found 
      which caused nearly all treasure to have overly high requirements; in all 
      future treasure, you should find that most treasure items have lower 
      requirements for use than in the past. This change is slight for average 
      treasure, but more significant for powerful treasure. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An additional character option lets you 
      turn off most weather effects, to speed up your frame rate. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A handful of tweaks were made to rumors, 
      quests, portals, object placement, and graphics. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some chests or other places in the game 
      would stop respawning their items under certain conditions. At least one 
      of those conditions is now caught, and the spawn will now fail less often, 
      if at all. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug in throwing weapons code 
      that made them less likely to hit their targets. This is now fixed, so you 
      may want to give thrown weapons another chance. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When you attacked monsters that were 
      resistant to a basic type of damage (bludgeoning, slashing, etc), the chat 
      log reported full damage, even though you were doing reduced damage. This 
      is fixed. You are not doing any less damage due to this update; it is just 
      reporting the damage accurately. </font></li>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">For several weeks an unnatural 
    winter gripped the world of Asheron's Call. In the first of our monthly 
    world-impacting events, all players couldn't help but notice the ice and 
    snow, the enchanted snowmen, and the holiday robes, but only a few of the 
    most powerful and adventurous experienced the full scope of the designers' 
    work, which also involved fantastic new castles, a large ice-cave network, a 
    vast underground city, and recipes for foods with useful new properties. 
    Here are some screenshots from the event (click each thumbnail to view the

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    From the Bandit Fortress of MacDugal to Lady Tallial's Neydisa Castle and 
    the desert town of Zaikhal, many brave adventuring parties followed rumors 
    of the hidden city of Frore. Deep beneath the earth they arrived at their 
    goal and also at a confrontation with the ghastly Gelidites, necromancers 
    who had converted the poor Sir Joffre Tremblant to their undead state. 
    Battling to the very heart of Frore, the heroes faced a huge, sentient 
    gemstone that blasted all who tried to approach. The artifact claimed many 
    lives, but ultimately lay in fragments, bleeding out the heat it had stolen 
    from the core of the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The heroes returned to well-deserved 
    accolades to enjoy the seasonal festivities underway before their departure, 
    confident that Dereth would soon become warm and verdant once more. However, 
    all was not settled. On the corpses of a Gelidite Lord and Sir Joffre were 
    found old books that hinted the defeated artifact had contained some dark 
    new terror. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Congratulations to Abrim of Morningthaw, who 
    won our story contest with the following account of his adventure to Frore:
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>I knew the end was near. For good or bad, 
    I had come to the end of my journey. I grieved the loss of my friend Kyoujin, 
    his body broken by the denizens of this cold, dark place. I knew he would be 
    all right, the magic of the lifestone had captured his spirit, protecting 
    him against true death, but it was small consolation to me as I stood there 
    over his body, wondering how I could go on alone. This was my not my first 
    attempt to unravel the mysteries of this Lost City of Frore. During the 
    last, I had come alone, and had been thwarted by the locks of the City. The 
    Gelidites took great pains in preserving their privacy, in designing and 
    constructing this place. I wandered, cold and lost, for a long time before 
    finally using my magic to escape the darkness, planning to return again.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Return I did, this time accompanied by 
    Kyoujin, an aspiring mage who also had some skill with locks. Together, we 
    sought to bring an end to the bitter winter that blankets Dereth, not fully 
    understanding the danger of this place, and the power of the forces within. 
    Together we fought against the undying guardians, and won our way into the 
    City. Deeper and deeper we ran, finally coming face-to-face with Tremblant 
    himself, now transformed into a hideous monster, his dead body reanimated by 
    some evil magic. Kyoujin was no match for him; Tremblant had broken him, and 
    had almost destroyed me as well, before I finally managed to bring him down.</i>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Now, as I stood before this doorway, the 
    blistering heat from within was almost welcome in this otherwise frigid 
    place. I feared in my heart that I might suffer the same fate as Tremblant, 
    doomed forever to guard this dark place. I relived in my mind the long 
    journey that had brought me here: the quest for Tremblant's party, seeking 
    out the pieces of the mystic rune transcription, the warnings of the 
    translators, the long run to the Plateau. A sound from within roused me from 
    my thoughts. The Great Work, perhaps sensing my presence, had begun to stir. 
    The time had come for me to face this final challenge. As I opened the door, 
    the heat from within washing over me in waves, I sent a silent prayer to the 
    Poet, that my death might have meaning.</i> </font></p>

      Scotth@Turbine&gt; With me this evening are Dave Namerow, our community

      Scotth@Turbine&gt; He works in sync with the designers to give them feedback

      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; Hi All <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; And Chris Foster (aka Slapp), is the lead designer of the 
      projec <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; probably the guy most of you are wanting to strangle… <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... project. <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; Until you hear what he has to say :) <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Don't hurt me! I'm fragile! <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; Remember, violating the CoC will get you booted from 
      here…. So please, be gentle…. <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; he's really a nice guy... give him a chance. <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hi all. <br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; He squeezes nice ;) </font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Eek! <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Let's to the heart of it... <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... we know that some people have been concerned our 
      first update. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We've gotten a number of complaints about some changes... 
      particularly to life mages. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; It seems worth taking a minute and explaining how those 
      changes came about. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; When we approached the end of beta, we realized that some 
      of the goals of our design weren't being met. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; In particular, life mages were meant to be best at GIVING 
      life, not taking it. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; With the incredible range on drain spells, they had 
      turned out to be better warriors than our war mages. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We thought for a long time about how to address this. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Our first thought was: why address it at all? Just 
      because things don't go as planned, doesn't mean a change is necessary.
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; But then we realized we were facing a potential worse 
      case scenario... <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... where non-life-mages were frustrated that they'd 
      chosen the wrong skills, and life mages were bored at how easy the game 
      had become. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Then we considered simply boosting all of the other 
      professions to match life mages. </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; However, that would have meant 
      changing just about EVERY stat in the game, otherwise EVERYONE would have 
      found themselves rushing through the game and getting bored. That wasn't 
      practical. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; That left us with the one option that we'd wanted to 
      avoid at all costs: removing some of life mages' power. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We're sorry that we had to do it, but it was necessary to 
      making the game more balanced and fun for everyone. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; *deep breath* okay, that's my spiel. I'm sure I'll come 
      up with more stuff to say when people start asking questions. Anything to 
      add, Scott? <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; I think we’re ready for questions now. And yes, extending 
      a question to sub questions counts as multiple questions. We’re trying to 
      get through as many questions as possible, and want to give each person
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; a chance to ask theirs <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Except Scott. :) <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; so, let's get rolling with those questions <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; erm.... <br>
      </font><br>

      Scotth@Turbine&gt; Jeff from Des Moins, you're on line one... <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Ta da! <br>
      </font><br>
      jeffhartsell&gt; Ready...First off...addictive game...great job!! Now...my 
      comments and my ONE question (sort of) :-) ... <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Scotth@Turbine&gt; what's on yer mind? </font><br>
      <br>
      jeffhartsell&gt; Comment: At one point it was mentioned that players could 
      learn any spell that creatures cast. I assumed then that Water Golems 
      would gurgle, &quot;Zojak Quafeth&quot; when they cast acid stream, which is not the 
      case... <br>
      jeffhartsell&gt; I have read that some creatures do use the power words. 
      Plus, some creatures cast spells that appear to be unlearn-able, such as 
      missiles, and they don't follow player casting conventions. Now, my 
      question... <br>
      jeffhartsell&gt; Q: Do you have plans for all creatures to use power words 
      and a focus when appropriate or do you intend to introduce new spells 
      mainly via scrolls, research, or other nefarious methods? Please 
      elaborate. Thanks! END <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hi, Jeff. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We plan on using a mix of ways to introduce new spells. 
      Some will show up first on monsters, some in scrolls, some as new 
      components to explore. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; In some cases, we may do all of those at once, as each 
      player is likely to find only one of those occurrences. (done) <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; candy, GA <br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Scotth@Turbine&gt; hello candyman, you're on Larry King 
      Live. What's your question </font><br>
      <br>
      candyman107&gt; okay ;) I was wondering if you plan on making any changes to 
      melee fighters in the near future. <br>
      candyman107&gt; Its seems like the game is more geared towards mages in the 
      higher levels. Everything casts high level war spells that does big damage 
      that a melee has little to no chance on resisting. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Scotth@Turbine&gt; such as? <br>
      </font><br>
      candyman107&gt; Being a level 42 blade with 255 sword as a specilized skill I 
      rely on life magic to survive and rarely use sword, espically since the 
      changes to the sword of lost light making it nearly unusable without 
      creature magic or rare magic items to increase stats <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Candyman, we're looking in general 
      at balance across professions and skills as players go up in level. <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; The sounds of Chris typing madly echo through the office
      <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; In general, it looks like for many players, professions 
      stay in sync as they rise in level. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; One thing we plan on looking at is the treasure system, 
      to make sure that high-level players have access to weapons that make them 
      even more powerful. Those may be too hard to find now. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Thanks for the question. (done) </font><br>
      <br>
      DA_hOsTiLe_DtH&gt; Hi....I was wondering if mabey you guys could create some 
      kind of NPK ring so all the NPK's can fight in like a match. This would 
      make the game alot more interesting..and there could be prizes and I was 
      also thinking of a ranking system. Thanks =) <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; I can take that <br>

      Voiden&gt; Evening all,.last week my charactor went missing, and have had no 
      assistance with this problem,is this normal not to get responses to emails 
      to comments and complaints and have other people had this problem with 
      character loss as well? thanks end . <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; I'll answer that one... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; We apologize but we cannot answer email personally... there

      Stucco@Zone&gt; As for that bug, we are looking into it. Make sure you are

      kdavid1&gt; I have two good questions, 1) On the Harvestgain World, I and 
      many others experience &quot;lag&quot; problems. This sudden drop in response time 
      to our computers during a fight has led the the loss of many good lives in 
      Dereth. Killed by a drudge(shakes head)... <br>

      have a run of 130 and can barely outrun the Grommies. <br>

      Lord_Xorus&gt; [My Question:] How about 'Random Events'? - Like portals 
      appearing throughout the land for a limited time to a temporarily

      weapons, enchanted armor, or even a secret town!? =)) <br>

      RoBz26&gt; Hey Turbine Guys and MrQ. First off, I would like to congratulate 
      you guys on the current success of the game. I'm not playing retail YET, 
      but I will soon, and loved beta :) ... <br>
      RoBz26&gt; Anyhow, on to my question. Is it possible to get Magic Defense so 
      high as to be immune to magic attacks, like with Melee defense..... <br>
      RoBz26&gt; In other words, if i keep pumping and pumping XP into it, would I 
      be able to resist all spells up to a certain point (Like how a level 20 
      warrior cannot be hit by a skulker :)? Or would it go by luck also? Thanks 
      in advance. <br>
      RoBz26&gt; Oh, and 'hey' to you too Stucco :) <br>
      RoBz26&gt; Done <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; Hey! </font><br>

      RoBz26&gt; And merry christmas <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hiya RoB... <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; There's probably the ability to block low-level spells 
      totally, but since Magic Defense gets less boost from Magic Defense than 
      the Spellcasting skills, it's unlikely to completely block high-level 
      spells. <br>

      Drobb2&gt; Any changes in the works to how player corpses are going to be 
      handled? Between Items vanishing from them, and rumors of loot bugs, 
      unrecoverable corpses due to lag, is the corpse time going to be increased 
      (and can they please disapear once emptied? <br>

      SaberLayne&gt; Great game, Visual (A+), Audio (A+), Interface (A+), Story 
      (A+). I would like to see a more permanent type residence in Dereth, say 
      after a succesful quest some place to stash your loot and call home. Has 
      this been considered for future updates? <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; I'll answer that, since it's about 
      future features... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; We really want to develop the world and part of that is a 
      &quot;home&quot;.... <br>

      peterwie&gt; i'm wondering if the monster behavior will become more complex 
      in the future. creature behaviors like territoriality, hunting, flight &amp; 
      migration seem basic and not impossible to approximate and would really 
      increase the &quot;reality&quot; of the environment ... <br>

      gettting fought back. banderling guards going off post to hunt for

      S_t_r_i_k_e_r&gt; Hi!, in any time soon will some of the weapons follow their 
      reqs as in lets say a sword has no spells but requires 200 sword skill to 
      use will you not let the swords be equipable or maybe if that is too harsh 
      maybe to lower the potential... <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hmm... </font><br>
      <br>
      S_t_r_i_k_e_r&gt; of the sword like say the sword needs 200 sword skill but 
      you have 100 so maybe the damage or speed would be decreased by 50% or so?
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; The restrictions are intended 
      solely for enchantments. If an item has no spells associated with it, I 
      don't think it should have a restriction at all. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; If you have such a treasure item, it should be looked at.

      ShAdOw9d9&gt; Hey, I am an archer, and I number 1...want to make sure the 
      incanta will be sold as much as mage ingredients are in stores...will this 
      be the case? or at least like 5 incanta per respawn? I want to make sure 
      my 200 fletching and 150 alchemy wont be wasted <br>
      ShAdOw9d9&gt; Q-Why doesnt coordination affect bow damage as much as strength 
      to melee..and why doesnt quickness or even swift killer affect bow reload 
      speed or bar speed? <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Scotth@Turbine&gt; Sorry, one question per customer <br>
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; I'll take the latter, since the first one was answered 
      already (they'll be enough). <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Coordination SHOULD do as much to affect missile damage 
      as it does for strength, I believe. As for the animations, we hooked the 
      speed only into the attack itself, for technical reasons. (done) <br>

      DesignLord&gt; Has there been any thought of adding some sort of coordinate 
      logging system to AC? It seems to be quite a break in the suspension of 
      reality provided in AC to suddenly stop and drop your mouse and keyboard 
      to grab a pen and paper to log coordinates. <br>
      DesignLord&gt; Something simple such as logging the coordinates and allowing 
      the user to add a description would work, seeing as coordinates play such 
      a large role in navigation of Dereth. (insert customary kissup closing 
      statement here) =) <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; That's a cool idea for enhancing 
      our maps. It's on our list of ways to expand AC in the future. We're 
      forming plans to keep the game expanding in lots of neat ways! <br>
      <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; Please remember we read everything sent to comments@asheronscall.com, 
      so if you have a suggestion, send it in! <br>
      <br>

      online atlases. They make navigating easier. (done) <br>
      </font><br>
      oPerrin&gt; Observation: The best ways to level are finding spots where<b>
      </b>you can hit monsters and they can't hit you prefferably with monsters 
      a good deal higher level than you. However you have already nerfed some of 
      these spots. <br>
      oPerrin&gt; Q: If you are planning on trying to eliminate camp spots, why 
      since many players find quick leveling and easy kills to be really fun?
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; That's a good question. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Leveling-up quickly CAN be a lot of fun. (I'm playing 
      Ultima: Ascension at home right now, and I'm enjoying the hell out of its 
      AI exploits.) <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; The problem with these exploits is that they let players 
      tear through the game much more quickly than we'd intended. While it's fun 
      now, it risks making the game boring in the long run. We want to keep the 
      game interesting for the long haul. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We also want to use these changes to make the game more 
      interesting overall. For example, expect certain monsters to learn from

      IronWolf92&gt; First of all great game, the emphasis on magic may make me 
      leave though <br>
      IronWolf92&gt; My question <br>
      IronWolf92&gt; Why were Dual wielding (which is in your advertising and 
      material pictured) and two handed weapons left out? Theyve been staples of 
      RPGs for years now... <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Dual weapons weren't done, mainly 
      because there was so much more to do. It's something we'd like to consider 
      adding in the future. <br>

      oyouno&gt; Are there any plans to improve enemy creature animation skating 
      problems and rubberbanding during chase scenes in exterior combat? 
      Currently creatures often travel great distances without animating when

      Stucco@Zone&gt; Yes, I've seen that too and it does bug me. Dealing with 
      latency, while keeping the world accurate, is a big challenge... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; All ORPGs can do better with it and I want us to be the best. 
      We won't ignore it, thanks! Rest assured at least that though it looks 
      sketchy, the code underneath is quite accurate. (done) </font><br>

      Buffy_Becca&gt; Will turbine create any gender specific armor, clothes, 
      quests, etc: i mean even UO has female armor. I know about the polygon 
      problem with flowing clothes but something to distingush gender choices.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Scotth@Turbine&gt; Yup, there will be some gender 
      specific stuff coming up shortly. Armor though, is actually gender

      Bytenator&gt; BTW great game! I haven't slept since I got on beta phase 2... 
      anyway is there plans for &quot;trade skills&quot; like black smitihng (ability to 
      craft weapons/armor from supplies found), or allowing (high level) players 
      to make items that cast spells? (END) <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; Future plans.... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; ...are vast! We really like the craft skills, and as Dereth 
      moves out of its frontier days, it makes sense for more skills to become 
      popular... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; ...the nice thing is that we have a great infrastructure to 
      work with, so expect good things on the way. The hard part will be 
      choosing what to do! (done) <br>

      <br>
      war_zealot&gt; during last sundays &quot;freak accident&quot; I was traveling up to the 
      crater to meet my patron, in the middle of my trip... I froze. (lag) and 
      watched in horror as a male tusker bounded up and devoured poor gyran, (I 
      lost a GMC and a sweet sword)... <br>
      war_zealot&gt; so, I'm thinking retribution lol, lets say.... hmmmm, well a 
      new GMC would be nice... but a matt coat would be better, lol. (done) (and 
      don't be saying you can't do that, because you said you can only do that 
      once it's in retail, and it is in retail.) <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; Please have your question ready to 
      paste in if you can, thanks! <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; I'll take that.... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; Well, we never released anything official about doing 
      reimbursements in retail. If you heard that, it was not from an official 
      representative... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; ...we decided a long time ago that we would not reimburse due 
      to bugs. There is no way to do it equitably and not create a lot of hurt 
      feelings, and a lot of work for our staff. No game I have played has done 
      it well... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; ...we need our staff to be helping in other ways. We truly 
      regret any loss from bugs or lag, and we are doing all we can to prevent 
      them, but we will not be reimbursing players. Loss must be bourne as best 
      you can. (done) </font><br>

      cfoster@Turbine&gt; We're not saying much about the main quest yet, but it IS 
      similar in some ways to our epic quests, like Sword of Lost Light. That's 
      not for novices. Draw conclusions as you will. (And expect more info in 
      the future.) <br>

      Xforn&gt; Wow.. my turn finally. Well, first off, I think AC is a great, 
      addicting game. I really like the trade skills, but I think there could be 
      more. I can think of a major one being setting gems into weapons and 
      armor... (more typing) <br>
      Xforn&gt; It could make them worth more, or if a magic gem was set it, it 
      would give the item magical properties. There has been talk before of 
      players being merchants (maybe they could own their own buildings for 
      players to shop in). <br>
      Xforn&gt; What new trade skills do you guys KNOW are going to be in the game 
      eventually(which ones are going show up in the next update)? <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; We have no specific trade skills in 
      mind for the future, but a lot of cool ideas to make trade skills more 
      interesting. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; For this event, expect to see some of your current trade 
      skills used in new ways. <br>

      Scorsha&gt; I rescearch everything befor I buy it or have anything to do with 
      it. I was recomended Ac from a very good fried. The last week and a half I 
      have read up on your wonderfull program. You almost have me, but I'm a 
      little ify on the start up coast of 45 d <br>
      Scorsha&gt; dollors. I located a demo to see if it was worth it, but 
      apprently beta3 is not useable for the ten days any longer? Is this true. 
      If so, why? By the way, you guys are funny ;) Oh and can Mr.Q get rid of 
      the enter and exit bits. They bug me. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">+MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Sure can Scorsha... go to OPTIONS, 
      its an selectable option there for you. <br>
      <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; Yes, the demo is no longer active. We may do a demo later, 
      but we did not want to risk the server load from a demo. I advise you play 
      with your friend's account a bit and decide.... </font><br>

      _7_Cha0s&gt; Please read my short build to my question for many that are 
      waiting have the same issue and it is a real bad problem in the game code 
      that needs to be addressed.... <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; Im a level 28 blademaster specialized in sword skill of 205. I 
      use an Olthio sword with Blood drinker III and Swift killer III making it 
      6-23 damage speed 6. <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; I hit a level 11 zombie with the attack bar half way and can 
      only hit it for 5-15 damage but yet a level 25 archer can kill it with 1 
      shot. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; I've seen your email! ;) </font><br>
      <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; You have taken away the SoLL from every blademan that is trained 
      in item enchantment. By the time anyone can use it they will be able to 
      cast those same spells on a sword that hits harder than 5-11. <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; yes tyou have =) <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; There is no sword anywhere that hits as hard as a force bolt III 
      which is 18-35, they are all 5-12 3-10 4-14 Ive worked my butt of on my 
      blademan to get that SoLL but now that i have it, it is useless to me. <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; Me and my 2 vassals are all level 28 with the same exact build. 
      We sat in the hall of the helms for 2 hours trying to get 1 helm but we 
      never did there were 2 archers in there lvl 25 and 26 killing the guardian 
      in 2 shots. <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; We all used a 6-23 speed 6 sword and did barely any damage. I 
      have screenshots of my super sword that i have in action on a lvl 11 
      zombie 12,13,23. A goldenback tusker 4,4,5,2,3 same sword mind you except 
      for 1 difference <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; Hail, 7. <br>
      </font><br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; This time i have buffed up my sword skill to 227. My question 
      is.... <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; Why are not all characters created equal? A skill in a certain 
      class lets say bow 0-100 hits for 20 max sword 0-100 hits 20 max mage 
      0-100 20 max? that will make it more fair to everyone and give you total 
      balance. Since the blademen cannot camp on a r <br>
      _7_Cha0s&gt; ridge and shoot at mobs that are 50 levels higher than they are.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; We've been looking at balance 
      between professions. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; And the data is VERY interesting. In many ways, it looks 
      like on average, characters are all leveling up at about the same speed.
      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; That makes it MUCH harder to address balance issues like 
      this. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; One thing we are going to look at is the treasure that is 
      generated, to make sure that everyone is getting what they need to support 
      their high-level skills. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Beyond that, we're going to keep surveying players, and 
      see what we can do to balance the game for the majority of players. 
      Changes are possible, but we want to make them CAREFULLY. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; The last thing we want to do is create and endless series 
      of shifts in game-balance. That's upsetting to everyone. <br>

      Lowgrey&gt; Thank you for taking the time to do this. As a webmaster of 
      www.pcpunks.com a fairly large AC website I am a little dissapointed in 
      how this patch was done. Not what was done so much as that people were 
      never consulted about what was about to be done... <br>
      Lowgrey&gt; to their game. They are also very frustrated with the product 
      support. The Senitels are given about no authority or power. This is how a 
      lot of people ended up on AC from EQ. Is this what we can expect in the 
      future? (done) <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      BoaBoa&gt; First off this game tops 'EQ' hands down I.M.H.O, and I see more 
      potential here, keep it up! Now for my Question... <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; We also explained some of the 
      rationale behind the changes, but in retrospect I think we could have 
      given more explanation. We've drafted another &quot;Spin from Turbine&quot; article 
      that gets into more detail. </font><br>
      <br>
      BoaBoa&gt; Will it be made so that all levels can participate in all dynamic 
      quests in some way and not geared to the high level characters? This was a 
      major problem in EQ where you needed to be close to level 40+ to stand a 
      chance! <br>
      BoaBoa&gt; And add some true dragons to the game! It just doesn't seem right 
      without having huge dragons crashing down on a party in an adventure game

      JamesWeb&gt; Thanks for the great game! I'm totally addicted (ask my wife). 
      One observation - Dillos are now faster than Matts! ;-) Now my 
      question.... <br>
      JamesWeb&gt; There have been rumors that Turbine has found the politics in 
      Darktide interesting at best. Are there any plans specific to PvP or the 
      DT server? I know about the much needed Jump/heal and Jump/Log bug that 
      will be fixed in the next patch... <br>
      JamesWeb&gt; i.e. monarch radar colors, more defenable fort towns, etc.... 
      (done) <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">cfoster@Turbine&gt; We DO find the PvP situation on 
      Darktide cool, and a good source of inspiration when planning future 
      features. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Our challenge is not just to make the PK world cooler, 
      but to find ways to take its elements of social risk and player-conflict 
      and bring them to ALL players... <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; ... without making the game an exercise in frustration 
      for devoted NPK's. <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Suffice to say there are cool ideas on the table... 
      (done) </font><br>
      <br>
      wirthit&gt; I am concerned that this is going the way of EQ and UO with 
      constant changes. When people get a strategy it is gone and they are 
      weakened or forced to group. This game was advertised exactly the 
      opposite. Is this what we are to expect? <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Stucco@Zone&gt; I'll give Chris a break here... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; ... we do NOT want or plan to shift the balance a lot. We 
      know &quot;other games&quot; have done that a great deal. It's very hard to have 
      perfect balance from the very start.... <br>
      Stucco@Zone&gt; The tweak we did was necessary to the long-term health of the 
      game, an extreme case. We did all we can to make the big shifts in the 
      first update only. We take this seriously, and hope you have faith in us 
      for the future. <br>

      instead of under it. There are many different types of clothing in the

      <br>
      cfoster@Turbine&gt; Wyvern, there are technical limits right now to how armor

	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Welcome to the Annals of Dereth, the 
	newsletter for the Asheron's Call role-playing game! We will be bringing you 
	this bulletin every month to give you a wide view on Dereth's evolving 
	community, events, and features.</p>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>
	</font> 
    <span style="font-family: Arial">
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">1 -- OUR SAGA THUS FAR... The Sudden 
	Season has fallen, and adventurers all across the isle have been following 
	rumors of its source to the lost city of Frore, home of the necromantic 
	Gelidites. News has come in of adventuring parties making successful forays 
	into Frore, but it remains to be seen what they have accomplished. <br>
	<br>
	With the snow still relentlessly falling throughout Dereth, it may be a bit 
	premature to discuss future upheavals, but we want to prepare you. We've 
	consulted with Asaina al-Arqis and her scholarly cabal, and while they 
	believe that Dereth's heroes will rescue the island from its magical winter, 
	they suspect that these events are a mere prelude to a greater threat. They 
	say that by thwarting the denizens of Frore, the heroes may have released 
	some shadowy evil from confinement. We will keep you updated. <br>
	<br>
	Meanwhile, the Asheron's Call team is really excited about the progress of 
	the community. The monarchies keep growing and becoming more sophisticated, 
	and Dereth has inspired our diligent fan sites to develop excellent stories, 
	articles, and even freeware reference tools. We're especially intrigued by 
	this concept of &quot;pyrealware&quot; advanced by Circeus, and are busting our brains 
	to figure some way of taxing him.... Read on to find out more. <br>
