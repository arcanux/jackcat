	</font><font face="Arial" size="1">(parts 1 &amp; 2 can be found
	<a href="../Texts/Coil.htm">here</a>)</font></span></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Large webbed hands and feet slapped at the 
	torpid water not far behind Ugluur. The little Ruuk's breathing was labored 
	and his muscles burned with a fire from days without food or rest. The Moar 
	had discovered him crossing the Kualuun Swamp three days prior and had 
	relentlessly pursued him across the swamplands. Uglurr had left Tkoruk 
	Guruul when the brothers Torgluuk and Morgluuk had disappeared into the 
	violet tunnel of smoke. Morgluuk and Torgluuk were attempting to claim the 
	destiny that was meant for the Kukuur – the Burun Elders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ugluur, loyal to the Kukuur, knew his duty 
	and had run through the dangerous swamps. He lived on what bomutur he could 
	find and evaded Moar hunting parties during his trek. His luck had held for 
	nearly three cycles of the moon and he was fast approaching the haven of 
	King Browerk – first amongst the Kukuur, eldest of their race and the 
	greatest of all Burun. Ugluur had evaded the four hunters that Morgluuk had 
	sent after him; they were killed some ten days past when the great eye 
	stared down and exposed them to the Moar. This had given him hope that the 
	Sleeping One was guiding his actions and ushering him closer to his ultimate 
	destiny. But then he had stumbled into his pursuers' trap. The Moar had 
	hounded his steps from that moment until now. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After springing the trap he had fled to the 
	tree tops, leaping from the wide brim canopy of one feelun tree to another. 
	He swung from the vines that hung down from the tkoruk and tried to keep his 
	scent away from the swamp. It was to no avail; the Moar were ruthless 
	hunters capable of scenting him on the pungent wind. He prayed to the 
	Sleeping One that he be granted the ability to deliver his message and warn 
	the Kukuur of what Morgluuk and Torgluuk planned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fate had its own design on Ugluur's life.
	</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the brush, the hulking form of a Burun 
	Guruk stirred and let out a deep growl. Ugluur didn't hear the sound over 
	the gnashing of jaws and spattering of water behind him. He chanced a look 
	back and caught his foot on the root of a tree. Faltering, he tried to catch 
	himself with his left hand and felt the bones in his arm snap. He sprawled 
	forward into the swamp and rank water stung his eyes and filled his mouth. 
	He rolled hard to his right, propping himself on the spongy swamp floor, and 
	let out a screech of defiance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Moar closed around him. Their jaws were 
	open wide, dripping cold ichor, and they bore a feral fury in their eyes. 
	Overwhelmed by fear, Ugluur whimpered and scurried back a few feet. The Moar 
	skittered about him, toying with their meal. Ugluur tried to stand, but the 
	sounds from the Moar drove him into to a helpless position while he tried to 
	think of a way to escape. Nothing came into his mind. Fate it seemed would 
	claim him before he could warn his masters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first Moar leapt at his throat as a 
	hulking form emerged from the shadow of the brush. A flash of dark violet 
	crashed into the swamp and the hulking Guruk caught the Moar and crushed its 
	head with one hand. As the second Moar closed on Ugluur, the Guruk spun and 
	met the beast with a powerful swat of its other hand. The Moar crashed into 
	the side of a tree and slid beneath the fetid water. Then the Guruk turned 
	toward the remaining four Moar and issued a guttural challenge that shook 
	the boughs of the nearby trees. Overpowered, the Moar retreated behind 
	leaves and sunk into the swamp, swimming away through the mire.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Guruk watched as the Moar retreated from 
	him and then turned his attention back to the Ruuk that lay whimpering in 
	the muck. Ugluur lay in the water staring up at his savior with a feeling of 
	joy that quickly gave way to dread. Without warning, the Guruk wrapped his 
	hand around Ugluur's face and snapped the Ruuk's neck hard to the right. It 
	didn't kill him, but Ugluur fell immediately unconscious.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Guruk hoisted the Ruuk over his shoulder 
	and walked toward master Reeshan's temple. There the other Elders were 
	gathered. Another tunnel had opened, and all those that had been sent 
	through had not returned. Mgrauleshk – the Guruk – was sweeping the area 
	around Reeshan's temple to ensure that the Moar would not have the 
	opportunity to attack the Kings as they met on this auspicious occasion. A 
	meeting of this gravity occurred only when there was an absolute necessity. 
	The last occasion was more cycles ago than Mgrauleshk could fathom. This 
	meeting was of great importance and his liege wanted the area cleared of all 
	danger. Finding a member of Tkoruk Guruul Clutch was a windfall he had not 
	expected.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">T'Kuruul Reeshan stood five hundred steps 
	above the floor of the swamp and was comprised of Burun and Fiazhat 
	architecture. The temple had been built in a time when his caste, the Guruk, 
	and the Kukuur as well were forced beneath the surface of Bur. There were 
	thirteen like it scattered across the world. They had been built by the 
	Fiazhat to honor their false gods and were constructed of dark green stone 
	that Mgrauleshk had never seen within the bounds of the great swamps.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">During his life Mgrauleshk had visited six of 
	the thirteen temples and it was unlikely that he would visit many more. As 
	Mgrauleshk pushed his way through the ferns and trees that covered the 
	T'Kuruul Reeshan temple, he was gripped by the enormity of the situation 
	that they faced. Around the base of the temple, thousands of camps of Ruuk 
	and Guruk were busy preparing food, carving weaponry and preaching the 
	stories of the Sleeping One and the vengeance that was close at hand. Each 
	step of the temple was one hundred feet deep and thirty feet high, with a 
	ramp that allowed access to the next step placed at the center on each of 
	the faces. This progression continued until the top fifty steps, where the 
	dimensions dropped in half, then at five steps dropped in half again. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently, the lower hundred steps were 
	cluttered with troops preparing for the coming battle. The next hundred 
	steps were littered with Elite Guards, all of them Guruk, bearing the 
	symbols of the twelve Elders. Beyond that level the voices of hundreds of 
	individuals, some slaves, some warriors and some elders amongst the outer 
	fringes of the Clutches milled and conversed in hushed tones. Flags sewn 
	from the hides of hundreds of creatures including the Fiazhat and Moar, 
	twelve in all, flew from the temple's ramparts. Above these flags flew the 
	largest and grandest, King Browerk's flag.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Browerk was the most ancient of their race. 
	Rumors persisted that he had been present for the first wars against the 
	Fiazhat, that he was the mind that first linked the other Kukuur and it was 
	he who had lead the Burun from the darkness of the under realm. It was his 
	birthright to revisit upon the Fiazhat's false gods the full force of the 
	Burun. He was unquestionably the leader of the Burun and he was a fair and 
	just ruler. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mgrauleshk had never seen Browerk, but he 
	knew of the king's life. Browerk had been betrayed by his offspring Tkrowerk. 
	Tkrowerk had given great secrets to the Ruuk of Tkoruk Guruul and for that 
	Browerk had killed his offspring, ending the line of his throne. It was 
	unlikely that he would gestate another egg after so many thousands of years 
	of life. Mgrauleshk was unclear as to why the King had permitted the Ruuk to 
	live, but he had never broached the subject with his liege Reeshan. It was a 
	matter for the elders, not the small minds of the Guruk. Mgrauleshk had been 
	granted a small boon; he was greater than his Guruk brothers in that he knew 
	a smattering of magic, a gift for a lifetime of service. This boon was given 
	only to those who would one day become Jurrugar, the most elite of the Guruk 
	Gorefiends, it mark him as honor bound and trusted above all others. As was 
	his duty, Mgrauleshk knew that his king would want to see the prisoner that 
	he carried over his shoulder, so he began to walk toward the pyramid.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The air around the temple was foul, thick 
	with the scent of bomotur roasted on spits turned over fires lit by burning 
	koruu. Ruuk were filthy creatures that would often cover their hides in a 
	thick coating of the mire. They reeked of the more vile part of the swamp 
	and were at best savage without strength. Mgrauleshk reviled his smaller 
	cousins. The existence of the Ruuk caste was a blight on the Burun and he 
	longed to slaughter them and sup on their flesh. But after the last civil 
	war the kings had pronounced that cannibalism was wrong. Now, as he walked 
	through the teeming mass of Ruuk, he wanted nothing more than to strike out 
	and devour the heart of one of the little things raw.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he walked through the throng the Ruuk 
	parted and allowed him through. He was well known amongst the Ruuk and the 
	Guruk of this area. They knew his cruel intentions and they also knew that 
	he would violate the edicts of the kings if he were given leave. Some, 
	outlanders, were more defiant, wondering why he carried what appeared to be 
	a Ruuk corpse over his shoulder. They approached and prodded at the 
	unconscious form until Mgrauleshk uttered a growl that sent chills through 
	their spines. He approached the base of the temple and began the long climb.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Halfway up the temple he was met by the voice 
	of Kiree and Kreekun, two Ruuk that served as speakers for their kings in 
	all matters. They inquired as to the being that he carried and barred his 
	progress. Without a thought he pushed through them, listening to their cries 
	as they tumbled down to the landing below. They sputtered curses and 
	threatened the wrath of their kings. Mgrauleshk didn't care -- this was 
	Reeshan's land and he was Reeshan's chief enforcer. This day he would also 
	deliver unto the highest king a great gift; he knew this in the core of his 
	being.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he reached the landing where the flags 
	flapped in a brisk wind he knelt before the Elite guards. These were the 
	strongest of the Guruk, champions whose lives were given to the service of 
	Browerk. They barred the way to the council of Elders.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jurukka, Mgrauleshk,&quot; one of the guards said 
	as he approached. &quot;You carry a load on your shoulder that looks most 
	interesting. His markings are those of the Tkoruk Guruul, are they not?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jurukka, Jerrugar.&quot; Mgrauleshk responded 
	with the same greeting of honor and took a knee before the guard, Ugluur 
	still slumped over his shoulder. &quot;Yes, this Ruuk is from Tkoruk Guruul, or 
	so his markings show. I happened upon him in the swamp south of the temple, 
	pursued by a host of feeble Moar-- ice breathers that were not of this area. 
	I bring him to the great chamber as an offering. A gift to the Elders and to 
	King Browerk.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Jerrguar nodded and acknowledged the 
	effort of the gorefiend by placing a hand on his shoulder. Mgrauleshk rose 
	when he was given leave to.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We shall inquire whether King Browerk 
	desires to see this gift,&quot; the guard said as he looked into Mgrauleshk's 
	eyes. The guard's eyes became glassy and distant for a brief moment. 
	Mgrauleshk knew what was happening. He had seen it before. Reeshan's Voice 
	would often get that look when King Reeshan would speak with him from afar. 
	Within ten seconds the guard's visage returned to normal and he stepped 
	aside. The guard beside him did the same. &quot;Enter the conclave, Mgraulesk.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jukuur grau, Elite One.&quot; Mgrauleshk stepped 
	between the guards and moved toward the conclave.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Power. Power flowed through the altar room of 
	the temple. Twelve elders stood at focal points in the circular room. In the 
	center of the room on a raised dais behind a long stone altar sat King 
	Browerk. His girth was the same as the others, odd given his age. Most 
	Kukuur that grew old became more engorged on the magic that flowed through 
	their veins. In time, this magic tore them apart and they exploded in 
	violent manner. Browerk showed no signs of reaching this size. Reeshan 
	looked at his servant as he walked into the room and laid his gift upon the 
	floor. Then Mgrauleshk knelt and offer up his palms to show that he meant no 
	ill.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jurukka, Mgrauleshk.&quot; Browerk's commanding 
	voice boomed through the chamber and echoed off the walls. When he spoke 
	tendrils of blue smoke poured from the corners of his lips, magic leaking 
	back into the air. &quot;You bring a great gift to this conclave.&quot; Mgrauleshk 
	felt a hand press onto his shoulder and felt something akin to a thought 
	enter his head. He rose instinctively, having been given the right to by the 
	presence of the hand. The voices began speaking directly into his mind.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All were present and all were able to see and 
	hear his thoughts. Mgrauleshk cleared his mind of everything and allowed the 
	Elders to probe through his head to find what had happened in the swamp. The 
	sensation was oddly terrifying and exhilarating. It lasted very briefly and 
	then he was able to see them all once again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">King Browerk hoisted his massive staff from 
	the floor and uttered a potent string of incantations that reverberated 
	throughout the room. Ugluur's body floated from the floor and drifted slowly 
	toward the altar. As it passed over a seal of a great eye on the floor the 
	little Ruuk awoke. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ugluur stared up at the Eye, bearing down 
	upon him from high in the sky above. His neck hurt; it had been broken by 
	the gorefiend that had saved him from death at the hands of the Moar. He 
	felt tiny tendrils of something wrapping about his legs and arms and felt 
	cold stone on his back. Something akin to a thought entered his head and he 
	rebelled.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The power of the mucor in his veins would not 
	allow the intrusion. His mind was his and would not be controlled by 
	another. The Sleeping One's Eye disappeared from his view and he saw the 
	forms of thirteen Kukuur around him. All of them stared upon him with 
	slavering tongues hanging out of mouths lined with thousands of sharp teeth. 
	The battle turned inward to his mind's eye and they fought. In the end, 
	Ugluur relented to the will of the thirteen elders and he returned to 
	consciousness long enough to see the Sleeping One's Eye one last time before 
	he died.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Eye was framed by four pillars&amp; no, 
	statues, statues of the Fiazhat's gods. They stood with outstretched hands, 
	holding the Eye high in the sky. But they reached into the sun and it turned 
	dark and terrible. At once the eye turned blood red and wept a single tear 
	onto the little Ruuk's forehead. Then there was nothing.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">King Browerk let loose a chortle and a puff 
	of blue smoke as the Ruuk perished. It had fought valiantly against the 
	psychic assault, but the power of the thirteen Elders was too great. Browerk 
	looked to the sky and saw that the spires framed the Eye perfectly and he 
	communicated to the Elders what must be done. He then turned his attention 
	to Mgrauleshk.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We will flay this one's soul, as it has 
	forsaken the Burun and allowed the transgression at Tkoruk Guruul to occur. 
	You have brought this gift to us, Mgrauleshk. Name your reward and you shall 
	have it.&quot; Browerk nodded sagely and another trail of blue energy wafted from 
	his mouth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Jukuur Grau, Elders and King Browerk. I 
	require no reward for my service to the Sleeping One and to the Elders and 
	your majesty.&quot; He paused briefly and watched as the Elders nodded sagely. 
	&quot;But if it please you that I take something for this gift, I will ask for 
	two small tokens.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Browerk admired the Guruk's candor and 
	courage. &quot;Speak.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I desire to sup on this Ruuk's flesh. If it 
	is to be soul rent then it shall not return and there is no edict that 
	states that a shell with no hope of return needs to be burned.&quot; Mgrauleshk 
	stood tall and resolute.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Granted,&quot; Browerk was quick to answer. There 
	was no point in disputing this as it was a fair reward. He waited to hear 
	what the second demand would be.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;My second request.&quot; Mgrauleshk did not 
	falter, he did not stumble over himself to speak, he was speaking without 
	his own voice, he was speaking as a hero to his people, he was asking for a 
	great boon. He wanted a gift that would only be given to an Elite One, but 
	he was certain that this would be his day. He felt empowered in the light of 
	the Sleeping One's Eye. He knew that this request would be answered and so 
	he continued. &quot;Long have we waited for the tears of the Sleeping One to end. 
	Long have we waited for our revenge upon the Fiazhat's false gods who gave 
	rise to the Moar and nearly destroyed we Burun. We know that the pathways 
	beyond the vast divide have begun to open. I know that you mean to rend this 
	one's soul.&quot; He motioned to Ugluur's lifeless body. &quot;I wish to bear witness 
	to what this soul rending looses.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Granted.&quot; Browerk did not hesitate. At once 
	inside his head he heard the protests of the other Elders. They did not want 
	a Guruk present to see the greatest rite they possessed, but Browerk belched 
	once and the voices fell silent. &quot;You shall bear witness, and then&amp; be 
	tasked. Do you accept this task?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;With honor, King Browerk,&quot; Mgrauleshk 
	replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You have yet to hear what this task will 
	be,&quot; Browerk returned.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It will serve the Sleeping One and serve the 
	Elders. This is my duty. All tasks commanded by this council are from the 
	Sleeping One and I perform those deeds without hesitation,&quot; Mgrauleshk 
	replied coolly and honestly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Very good.&quot; Browerk nodded once and called 
	the others to order. &quot;We begin.&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The eye was at its peak in the sky. The 
	chanting had begun in unison as Browerk finished his sentence, and for five 
	minutes the room was a cacophony of deep croaks and other sounds. Power 
	welled around him and forced the walls outward in a visible distortion that 
	made Mgrauleshk uneasy. On the altar, the still form of Ugluur twitched and 
	became bathed in an unholy light. At once a silver shape appeared about the 
	body and tore free with a blood-curdling scream. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The silver form, a perfect ghostly image of 
	Ugluur, floated above the body and looked down. An expression of panic 
	spread across the ghostly face and it tried to flee but was held in check by 
	the same grim light that had ripped it from its body. Within seconds it 
	ceased struggling and looked at Browerk. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Tell us of what transpired at Tkoruk Guruul,&quot; 
	Browerk commanded.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the soul began a tale that lasted until 
	the eye closed that evening.</font></p>

    <font face="Arial">From 
    the<span lang="en-us"> 
	</span></font></small><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">
	Turbine Site 
	(Oct. 13, 2004)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius considered the maps again. With the 
	death of one Burun leader and the disappearance of another, the creatures 
	had become more violent but less organized. The situation had improved... 
	but only marginally.<br>
	<br>
	Some of the Burun had turned on their Lugian and Tumerok allies. This meant 
	that there was no longer a unified front. K’rank’s spies had confirmed that 
	fewer than half of the Burun that had entered the pact with the renegades 
	remained; this was a blessing. However, the main Burun forces continued to 
	roam across Dereth and many of the land’s other inhabitants had been stirred 
	up by their passing. Reports of large packs or warbands approaching 
	dangerously close to towns were filtering in from guards posted in towns all 
	across Osteth. In the Direlands, it was more difficult to tell if the 
	increased activity was part of standard assaults or as a result of the 
	continued Burun incursion. <br>
	<br>
	It was frustrating. They had Morgluuk’s head on a pike but they were no 
	closer to eliminating the Burun as a threat to Isparian peace. Antius cast 
	his gaze over the location that Hendac had pointed out only a month before. 
	He closed his eyes and sighed. Antius hated the idea, but if Ciandra failed, 
	they would have no other choice. He comforted himself with the thought that 
	Elysa favored this course of action no more than he did. At least they 
	weren’t rushing into anything.<br>
	<br>
	“We need you to figure this out, Ciandra.” Antius rolled up the maps and 
	parchments. Elysa was waiting and he was already late.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	Mgrauleshk had waited patiently for the moment to strike. It had come when 
	the short pale ones felled Morgluuk and a wave of panic spread amongst the 
	Ruuk. Their morale was shattered, but he seized control of the masses before 
	they could turn on one another. Now, as he approached the outpost, he looked 
	down on the excavation site. This was the temple. This was the place where 
	he would find his way to open the well to T’Kuruul Reeshan and bring his 
	king to this world.<br>
	<br>
	The large gray-skinned humanoids worked alongside the purple-furred beings 
	to excavate the temple. Alongside them, he saw his brothers hoisting 
	boulders and heavy equipment. Their flesh cracked in the hot sun and he felt 
	rage swelling within. The time had come. He bellowed a command to his 
	brothers to rise up against the gray-skinned and purple-furred beings. As 
	one, the Guruk turned on their allies, claws ripped through flesh and the 
	renegade warriors crumpled beneath the weight of the assailants’ blows.<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk’s death and Torgluuk’s disappearance had left Mgrauleshk as the 
	only Burun who could lead. He had no interest in gathering those Burun who 
	remained loyal to the gray-skins and purple-furs, all he needed were the 
	group that accompanied him now. <br>
	<br>
	He crouched and made ready to spring over the ridge towards the temple. He 
	joined the one-sided battle and crushed the small resistance that the 
	renegade force could muster. Once they were all dead, he heaved his sword 
	into the air and bellowed a call to all those loyal to Bur. His voice echoed 
	across the wind and called to all those that did not believe that Torgluuk 
	would return. It was time.<br>
	<br>
	His King was waiting.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	Torgluuk looked down at his sickle. Blood dripped from the end of the blade 
	and spattered onto the cold floor of the meeting hall. Somewhere in the 
	room, Niarltah gasped for air through a torn throat. The sound was wet; 
	fluid was filling his lungs and he would soon die. Muldaveus looked up at 
	Torgluuk with his one good eye and whimpered like a Lugian babe. <br>
	<br>
	“Asheron… hides in Knorr… Olcris… Olcris… knows how to get there. Stonehold.” 
	Muldaveus spat blood from his mouth as he finished the sentence. Less than a 
	second later the sickle came down and split his skull.<br>
	<br>
	From somewhere in the darkness Niarltah sputtered and coughed out one word, 
	“Why?”<br>
	<br>
	“You let them kill my brother and the false Gods must be punished.” Torgluuk 
	left Niarltah there, bleeding, coughing, dying.<br>
	<br>
	Asheron. Asheron was a pale one, an ancient one. A Fiazhat God. The 
	reckoning was at hand.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	<i>Many of this month’s changes have already been described in detail in the 
	Letter to the Players. Here are some additional topics that we’d like to 
	discuss in detail.</i><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>HOUSEKEEPING<br>
	</b><br>
	“Housekeeping” means the server code that causes items to disappear after 
	they’ve been left on the ground for some time. This month we’ve made some 
	internal changes to allow us more flexibility in specifying how long items 
	can stick around before they disappear. For the vast majority of items in 
	the game, there is no change. Items such as Pack Dolls and Wedding Cake are 
	still set to never housekeep. Items such as torches are still set to 
	housekeep as quickly as possible. <br>
	<br>
	One change that players may notice is that Holiday Lights, which were 
	previously set to housekeep as quickly as possible, will now stay in game 
	for at least 30 seconds before housekeeping. This means that if you 
	accidentally drop your Holiday Lights, you have at least 30 seconds to pick 
	them up. Previously they would disappear almost instantly. <br>
	<br>
	There were a handful of items that were either set to never housekeep, or 
	set to housekeep instantly, that are now set to housekeep normally. These 
	include Olthoi Eggs, many title tokens, and the Statue rewards. Note that 
	this change will not cause statues to housekeep when hooked.<br>
	<br>
	<b>THE SKY<br>
	</b><br>
	In September we made a change to Dereth environment that was intended to 
	reduce the amount of time that you spent adventuring in the rain. 
	Unfortunately it had two unintended side-effects that were tied to older 
	code that we brought in: Bael’Zharon began re-appearing during lightning 
	flashes, and older and much larger moon images appeared in the sky.<br>
	<br>
	For October we’ve resolved both these issues while keeping the reduction in 
	“rain time”. We know that many of you liked the appearance of the larger 
	moons, and we looked at ways that we could keep the larger size with the 
	modern images. Unfortunately we simply didn’t have the resources to do so 
	this month.<br>
	<br>
	<b>DRAGGING ITEMS OUT OF YOUR HAND<br>
	</b><br>
	One frequent complaint that we’ve received is from players who have 
	accidentally unequipped their own weapon, caster, or shield and dropped it 
	on the ground. This can happen if you are trying to drag an item in the 
	world and accidentally click on your wielded item in the 3D view instead. 
	Your first instinct when this happens is to release the mouse button, and 
	now you’ve dropped your item on the ground.<br>
	<br>
	Starting this month, it is no longer possible to drag wielded items in the 
	3D view. You can still unequip these items normally from the inventory view, 
	and you can still pick up items by dragging them from your 3D view to your 
	pack.</font></p>

    (Oct. 1, 2004)</span></font></small><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome 
	to the October Letter to the Players! </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month in Dereth, Isparians struck a 
	major blow against the Burun menace by killing Morgluuk, one of the two 
	apparent leaders of these alien invaders. But the discovery of a fourth 
	temple as well as continued attacks by the larger Guruk Burun may have 
	complicated matters. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Queen's forces have begun arming those 
	who prove their worth with Noble weapons, and the spies under the Lugian 
	Captain K'rank continue to report on the movements of the Burun and the 
	Renegades. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As this ongoing struggle escalates, we turn 
	to the future.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Maintenance Window</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Beginning in October, we are scheduling a 
	regular weekly server maintenance window on Tuesday mornings. This 
	maintenance window will begin at 6AM PDT / 9AM EDT / 1PM UTC and will last 
	for two hours.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">During this time each week our Operations 
	personnel will have the option of performing maintenance on the game 
	servers, which may include downtime. While as always we will try to avoid 
	downtime as much as possible, it may be necessary at times to bring the 
	worlds down during this maintenance window without prior notice.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Scheduled maintenance outside of this window 
	will always be announced ahead of time on the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=180">
	State of the Network</a>.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Rollback Recompense</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of the October event, currently 
	tentatively scheduled for Wednesday October 13, it will no longer be 
	possible to obtain a free level from Jalina al-Hajj in Al-Arqas. We strongly 
	recommend that players not wait until the last second to obtain this free 
	level. If something were to impede a player's ability to obtain the free 
	level just prior to the October event, we would not be able to compensate 
	that player's characters.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>(These are items that we plan to implement 
	in the October event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior articles. 
	These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that 
	we'll be introducing in the October event.)</i></font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Salvaging Skill</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the October event, we will be introducing 
	a new skill to the game: <i>Salvaging</i>. This skill will be added 
	automatically to all existing characters and all new characters will start 
	with it. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Salvaging skill cannot be specialized and 
	is not based on any attributes. The Salvaging skill's curve for rate of 
	return when salvaging is considerably different from the curve used for the 
	existing Tinkering skills.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When any player attempts to use an Ust to 
	salvage an item or items, the game will check to see what skill will give 
	him the greatest return – one of his Tinkering skills, or the Salvaging 
	skill. It will then use that skill to salvage the item or items. The text 
	displayed when salvaging will now also let the player know which skill has 
	been used.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, let's say I have a Gold Mace 
	that I want to salvage. I open up my Ust, toss it in there, and click 
	&quot;Salvage&quot;. If the game realizes that I will get a better return using my 
	Salvaging skill, I'll see something like:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>You obtain 3 Gold (ws 6.00) using your 
	knowledge of Salvaging.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But if the game realizes that my Weapon 
	Tinkering skill would give me better return, I would see:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>You obtain 4 Gold (ws 6.00) using your 
	knowledge of Weapon Tinkering.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Salvaging skill, at very high levels, can 
	actually have a rate of return of greater than 100%!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We know that many characters may have trained 
	and spent experience on a Tinkering skill solely to be able to salvage more 
	efficiently in the field. Players of these characters may wish to untrain 
	the Tinkering skill and put the experience into Salvaging instead for a 
	higher rate of return. To this end, all characters will receive Gems of 
	Forgetfulness for each trained Tinkering skill upon first login after the 
	October event. These Gems will not count against the quest timer for skill 
	sellback. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our goal with this new skill is to allow all 
	characters to have the option of increasing their salvaging efficiency by 
	spending experience. In the past, only Gharu'n characters had this option 
	without spending skill credits. There are still balance issues with the 
	heritage groups that we plan to address, but we felt that giving all 
	characters access to effective salvaging was quite important. In addition, 
	we had the resources available to deal with this issue now, whereas solving 
	the other balance issues is considerably more complicated.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ust Improvements</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the Salvaging skill, in 
	October we will be introducing a number of improvements to the act of 
	salvaging itself. The three changes we are making for October are:</font></p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can now salvage items of multiple 
		material types simultaneously. See below for more details.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have resolved a rounding issue that 
		could cause you to receive more salvage from salvaging items 
		individually than from salvaging them all at once. Salvaging multiple 
		items at once will now provide the same amount of salvage as 
		one-at-a-time did in the past.</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer place full bags of 
		salvage into an Ust. In the past, this would prevent the Ust from 
		working. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most significant change is the ability to 
	salvage items made of multiple materials simultaneously. In the past, if I 
	had a Gold Long Sword, a Teak Nabut, and a Pine Budiaq, I would have to 
	salvage each item individually. Starting in October, I can drag all three 
	items into my Ust and click &quot;Salvage&quot;.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>You obtain 1 Pine (ws 6.00), 2 Gold (ws 
	7.00) and 1 Teak (ws 6.00) using your knowledge of Item Tinkering.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you will be doing this frequently and do 
	not wish to see the entire text each time, you can use the command <i>
	/filter –salvaging</i> to block the display.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we first announced this feature, many 
	players requested that we make this a toggle-able option. They enjoyed being 
	able to drag a full pack to the Ust and have it automatically filter all 
	items of a particular material type. So, we've gone ahead and added a new 
	option to the Character Options panel: <i>Salvage Multiple Materials at Once</i>.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, this option is unchecked – the

	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Crafting Quests</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As part of our continued goal of making more 
	content for tradeskill characters, we'll be introducing a new tier of 
	Crafting Quests for chefs, fletchers, and alchemists in October. These will 
	work the same way as the previous tiers have... although the NPCs 
	administering the tests may be asking for some items you've never seen 
	before. </font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Gromnie Teeth</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the same topic of content for tradeskill 
	characters, we come to the topic of the Gromnie Teeth quests. Since the 
	introduction of the percentage-based Ash Tooth crafting reward, some players 
	have used this and the skill sellback quest as a way to &quot;launder&quot; experience 
	into a non-craft skill. The introduction of additional percentage-based 
	rewards only exacerbated this behavior. These percentage-based rewards were 
	intended to benefit tradeskill characters, not to benefit players who only 
	train a trade skill so that they can eventually move the experience into a 
	combat skill.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For October, we initially investigated a cap 
	such that characters at or above a specific skill level would receive a 
	diminished reward. This proved to be a poor solution, and here's why:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consider two characters that have Cooking 
	trained at character creation, with a skill of 300. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Character A is optimized for Cooking: He's 
	got a starting Coordination and Focus of 100, has raised them both to 223, 
	and has put about an additional 56 million into his skill. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Character B is the exact opposite: He's got a 
	starting Coordination and Focus of 10, has put a minimum amount of 
	experience into them, and at 300 is one point away from capping his trained 
	Cooking.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For an Ash Tooth craft reward, Character A 
	earns about 6 million experience into his Cooking skill. Character B earns 
	about 420 million!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, obviously Character A is built for 
	Cooking. (Although you have to wonder why he didn't specialize the skill, 
	but I digress.) He'll be able to advance his skill to higher levels much 
	easier than Character B. So why is it that this Cooking quest has a better 
	reward for Character B than Character A?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This also shows why our initial idea couldn't 
	work. Where do we cap the experience reward for each skill level, when the 
	target characters can have such diverse stats?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead, we have chosen to put a flat cap on 
	the reward of any individual Gromnie Tooth: 10 million experience. No 
	Gromnie Tooth reward can exceed this cap.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, how does this affect our characters 
	above?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Character A sees no change. He earns his 6 
	million. Character B, on the other hand, hits the cap and earns only 10 
	million.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consider Character C, who has Alchemy 
	specialized and has optimized his character for Alchemy. He's started with 
	100 Coordination and 100 Focus and has always raised his attributes along 
	with raising his Alchemy.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When does Character C start hitting the cap? 
	Most likely he won't hit the cap until between 350 and 375 Alchemy, 
	depending on where he's put his experience. Even at 375 experience it's 
	possible that he'll only hit the cap on the Copper Tooth reward, the 30% 
	reward. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The goal of this change is to eliminate the 
	abusive behavior, with minimal impact on the tradeskill characters that 
	these quests are intended for. We're confident that this change will still 
	allow tradeskill character to advance to very high levels of skill through 
	these interactions while preventing the quests from being misused by other 
	characters.</font></p>

    (Oct. 14, 2004)</span></font></small><p><font size="2" face="Arial">
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=272">
	Last month</a> we let you know of our plans to split the launch of Turbine 
	Billing into two phases. The first phase would be for brand new accounts 
	only, and the second phase would be the migration of existing accounts off 
	of Microsoft's billing and onto Turbine's new system.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Currently the first phase – new accounts only 
	– is in the final rounds of testing. The servers are running, the game 
	worlds have the new authentication code, and the new installers and 
	launchers are ready to go. Our Quality Assurance and NetOps personnel are 
	running through the last tests to ensure that brand new accounts will be 
	able to be created and log in successfully.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We expect to be able to announce that new 
	accounts can be created on Turbine Billing very soon. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Here's where it can be confusing so please 
	read this through carefully:</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To create an account on Turbine' new billing 
	system, you will need a Turbine Product Key and the new launcher. When our 
	billing system first goes live, Turbine Product Keys will only be available 
	from the Turbine Store. &nbsp;Products purchased from our partner sites (for 
	example, GameSpy) will still work but you'll have to follow the existing 
	process of creating accounts with Microsoft.&nbsp; We will make the new 
	installers and Product Keys available on our partner sites in the near 
	future. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, if you've already made a purchase, don't 
	fret.&nbsp; You'll still be able to use it.&nbsp; And, you can feel free to purchase 
	from either the Turbine Store or our partner sites as we've made sure that 
	both methods for account sign-up will work.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, it is important to stress that <b>this 
	is only for brand-new accounts.</b> Existing Asheron's Call Dark Majesty and 
	Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings accounts will be able to be migrated at a 
	later date, and more information on this will be forthcoming. </font></p>

	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Turbine Billing for new accounts is live.</font></i></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, as we stated in last month's article,

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not yet. Migration of existing accounts to

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Initially Product Keys for Turbine Billing

	Turbine Store</a>, but they will be rolled out to our partner sites within

	can still be used to create new accounts on Microsoft's billing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Once you've purchased a new Product Key 
	for an account on Turbine Billing, you'll need to download the installer for 
	the new Turbine launcher. <b>Accounts created with Turbine Product Keys can

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After you've installed the new launcher, you 
	can run it by selecting it from the start menu or double-clicking it on the

		<font size="2" face="Arial">Additional Q&amp;A:</font></div>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. What are the requirements for the new 
	launcher?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. To run the new Asheron's Call launcher you 
	will need to have Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or later, or Microsoft 
	Internet Explorer 5.5 with 128-bit encryption, installed on your computer. 
	Your operating system must be Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows XP or later. 
	Windows NT and Windows 95 will not be supported.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Which web browsers are supported for 
	the Turbine Account management pages?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. We only officially support Microsoft 
	Internet Explorer version 6.0 or higher, however other web browsers such as 
	Mozilla may work with these pages.</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. What forms of payment do you accept?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. We currently accept Mastercard and Visa.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mastercard and Visa check/debit card are 
	accepted as well. Please be aware that if you use a check or debit card to 
	sign up for a new account, a temporary charge of $1.00 will be incurred at 
	the beginning of your free month. This $1.00 charge will be refunded after 
	1-3 days.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Additional payment options will be 
	implemented in the near future. </font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Will Turbine accept forms of payment 
	other than credit cards, such as checks or online services such as PayPal? 
	Will Turbine be selling &quot;game cards&quot; at retail?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Initially, no. These are all options that 
	we will be considering in the future, after the migration is complete.</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Will I be able to pay for my account 
	for more than a month at once? Will Turbine be offering any discount package 
	for multiple accounts or for players who want to subscribe to both games?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Initially, no. These are all options that 
	we will be considering in the future, after the migration is complete.</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Can I play Asheron's Call with my Zone 
	account and the new launcher?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Technically no, but the new launcher won't 
	prevent you from playing. You'll note that the first entry in the news pane 
	on the left of the launcher provides a web link for that very purpose. 
	Clicking the link will open a new web browser and bring up the Asheron's 
	Call pages on the MSN Gaming Zone. From there you can log in with your .NET 
	Passport and play the game as you always have.</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Can I have accounts in both systems?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Yes, you can. There's no reason why you 
	can't have one or more accounts on Turbine's billing system in addition to 
	one or more accounts with the MSN Gaming Zone. You would use the new 
	launcher for your Turbine Accounts, and the existing .NET Passport login for 
	your accounts on the Zone. During migration, your Zone accounts will become 
	Turbine Accounts.</font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Will third-party add-ons such as Decal, 
	dual-log programs, and windowed mode work with the new launcher?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Any program that doesn't alter the 
	Asheron's Call client should work fine. Decal, for example, will work 
	without any changes. The authors of some windowed mode and dual-log patches 
	may need to alter the launcher.ini file in the Asheron's Call directory to 
	prevent the client from being overwritten after they patch it. </font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Q. Can I download the new launcher without 
	buying a new account?</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Yes. The
	<a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=172">Downloads</a> 
	section of the Asheron's Call website will have a link to the new installer 
	very soon. Keep in mind that this will <i>not</i> allow you to use the new 
	launcher to log in to the game, you will continue to log in via the MSN 
	Gaming Zone as you always have.<br>
