      It had been several months since the world saw magic this great in scope
      and power. Now it comes again, but this time it is from an enemy that
      remains obtuse.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The skies continue to shift and with them
      now the land itself has changed. Through some understanding wholly alien
      to the Isparians the Virindi have furthered their incursion by altering
      the very nature of the wilderness. Creatures have been displaced and now
      inhabit areas never before seen.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Direlands have become a place of woe
      and despair. It is here that the Virindi have laid claim at last to the
      Obsidian Plains. They have driven away all others save for their allies
      and those they mean to warp to their own devices. Further to the north the
      Olthoi have been found swarming the landscape once again, there have been
      pockets of the Olthoi seen throughout Northern Osteth but this new
      revelation cannot bode well for the Isparians.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Zaikhal, a once trusted ally has begun
      displaying some frightening and unnerving characteristics. Diyas al-Yat
      has begun removing his head, revealing an erupting column of portal energy
      from his shoulders. This coupled with the arrival of the latest Virindi
      shock troops, the Simulacra, leaves the fate of this ally as a new mystery
      to be discovered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In dungeons bearing the same blood-red
      walls of their masters the Simulacra are preparing for what can only be a
      final assault against the Children of Ispar. These beings look like most
      Isparians in every way, yet their deliberate way of speaking will lend the
      first shadow of doubt to the cautious adventurer, and once they reveal
      their true selves by removing their own heads, attack and do not relent.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These new troops afford those adventurers
      strong enough to wrest victory from their tenacious grasp with a new
      shield and helmet of great power. These can be further enhanced with the
      addition of a strange gem found within a final stronghold of the
      Simulacra. But those halls are filled with beings of immense power and
      should be traveled only by the most hearty of warriors.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The changes to the world have had an
      unforeseen effect on the denizens of Dereth. While they have been pulled
      from their climates and homes some of the creatures have banded together
      under leaders of their respective races. These leaders are different from
      their lesser cousins in look and in power. Travelers should be wary when
      facing down one of these new foes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Autumn slowly begins to crawl toward the
      Isparians but it appears the war is far from over. Though the Virindi
      themselves have lightened their assaults this latest maneuver is one that
      has changed the way that most travel. This could be just a precursor to an
      even greater change. The raiding parties of the Virindi death squads have
      lightened but they still harangue the lonely travelers of the world.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a time of weary battle but the
      hearts of the people are strong and in the face of this great terror they
      shall not fail. But what comes next from the Virindi, and when?</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="History15.htm">Continued</a></font></td>
