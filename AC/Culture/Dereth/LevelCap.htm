		- Oct. 11, 2004</font></span><p><font size="2" face="Arial">At Turbine 
		Nation we announced that the upcoming Throne of Destiny expansion will 
		raise the Asheron's Call level cap. We also announced that players who 
		purchase the expansion will be able to use Augmentation Gems to develop 
		their characters in new and unexpected ways. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But what does all of that mean? How will 
		it affect you? Since Turbine Nation, you've been asking for answers to 
		these questions, for more details about exactly what we are doing and 
		exactly what it means to you. This article means to provide those 
		answers in exhausting detail. Some of this gets a bit technical, 
		however, so if you're looking for quick answers to basic questions you 
		may want to start with the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=281">
		FAQ</a>.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Some Definitions</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before we start discussing the changes in 
		store, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the current 
		advancement system in Asheron's Call. It is especially important to 
		understand some of the odd side effects of the current system.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, some definitions. Characters earn 
		experience (XP) in a variety of ways, including by killing monsters, by 
		completing quests, and by using skills. When a character earns XP, the 
		amount they earn is added to a counter of total experience. Total XP is 
		used only to determine that character's level – it cannot be spent to 
		develop the character; and it can only go up, never down. Depending on 
		the source of the earned XP, the amount earned is also added either 
		directly to a skill or attribute, or to a counter of available XP. 
		Available XP can then be spent to raise skills and attribute. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This gives us three generic types of XP 
		we can talk about: </font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Total XP: The absolute total of 
			experience the character has ever earned. This XP cannot be 
			transformed into other types of XP. </font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Invested XP: The sum of the 
			experience that is invested into all skills and attributes 
			(including secondary attributes). This XP can be turned into 
			available XP through skill sellback. </font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Available XP: The XP that the 
			character has available to spend on skills and attributes. This XP 
			can be turned into invested XP by spending it.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The following diagram provides an example 
		of these definitions:</font></p>
		<p align="center"><a href="ToD/173.gif">

		<div class="headlineMedium">

			</font><b><font face="Arial">The Level Cap Today</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It's easy to see that total XP <i>should</i> 
		equal the sum of available XP and invested XP. In AC as it stands today, 
		however, that isn't always true. There are some minor ways that these 
		numbers can become out of synch – for instance, when you break from your 
		patron and then swear to another patron, the swearing costs a small 
		amount of available XP without increasing your invested XP, so the sum 
		of available and invested is now less than the total. More common, 
		however, is the situation in which invested XP far outpaces total XP – 
		this happens whenever a character hits the current level cap. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">See, in our current system, all the XP 
		values of a character – including the counters for total XP, available 
		XP, and the XP invested into each skill and attribute – are stored in 
		32-bit integers. This means that there is an implicit cap on these 
		values. You cannot store a number larger than about 4.2 billion in a 
		32-bit integer. So total experience is capped at approximately 4.2 
		billion – or, using our handy XP-to-level table, level 126. So a player 
		character can never exceed level 126.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Invested XP, however, can continue to 
		increase even after total XP has run out of room. Because invested XP is 
		the sum of the XP invested into each skill and attribute, and each skill 
		and attribute can hold up to about 4.2 billion XP, the maximum possible 
		invested experience is almost 150 billion. That's 26 skills with capped 
		XP – the most you can afford with every skill credit in the game – plus 
		6 attributes, and 3 secondary attributes all capped at 4.2 billion. Note 
		that different character templates have different numbers of skills 
		available to invest into, and therefore different maximum possible 
		invested experience.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is important to understand that 
		invested XP is the only XP that actually increases the power of a 
		character. Because AC is primarily skill-based and not level-based, a 
		character's total XP does not actually confer any direct benefits to the 
		character (except the ability to enter certain level-restricted dungeons 
		or use certain level-restricted items). Total XP – and thus character 
		level – is merely a measure of how much XP a character <i>could</i> have 
		invested into skills and attributes if they invested everything they 
		earned. In a sense, then, character level is a rough measure of the 
		maximum potential power level of a character. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But after level 126 the character level 
		no longer reflects the relative power of the character in any way at 
		all. And this is not a small discrepancy: 4.2 billion vs. 147 billion is 
		a pretty big difference. To counter this, some players with characters 
		above level 126 have extrapolated the AC XP-to-level table all the way 
		up to 150 billion and now use their calculated invested XP to figure out 
		their effective level. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, to sum up: There are currently two 
		level caps in AC. The true level cap occurs at level 126, when total XP 
		can no longer be increased. The effective level cap occurs somewhere 
		between the extrapolated levels of 233 and 261 (depending on character 
		template) when invested XP can no longer be increased.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the Throne of Destiny expansion, we 
		are fixing this entire mess and raising both of these level caps. Read 
		on to discover how!</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">The Level Cap Tomorrow</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Level is just a reflection of your total 
		XP, so in order to raise the level cap we must increase the highest 
		possible total XP. And indeed that's just what we are doing. By 
		switching the internal storage of total XP to a 64-bit integer, instead 
		of a 32-bit integer, we can store numbers as large as 18 quintillion. 
		That gives us plenty of room for new levels! We're not initially going 
		to use all of that space, though. We've decided that the new cap will be 
		level 275, which can be reached with about 191 billion XP.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But if we just allow total XP to increase 
		without fixing the current mess – in which total XP and invested XP are 
		terribly out of synch over level 126 – then we've merely added more 
		confusion to the system. So in addition to increasing the storage for 
		total XP, we are also going to recalculate total XP based on the sum of 
		available and invested XP. We'll do this once for each character, the 
		very first time they log in after upgrading to the expansion pack. 
		During that recalculation, characters will also be awarded any new skill 
		credits for the levels they pass. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For example: Let's say that your 
		character is level currently 126, and in fact you've been level 126 for 
		almost a year now. You have 4.2 billion total XP, 1 billion available 
		XP, and 8 billion XP invested into your skills and attributes. The first 
		time you log in after upgrading to the expansion, your total XP will be 
		set to 9 billion, you will advance to level 146, and you will receive 2 
		skill credits.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Or, another example: Let's say you're one 
		of those driven players who has trained as many skills as possible in 
		order to drive your invested XP as high as possible. You have maximized 
		every skill possible, plus all your attributes, and you've even capped 
		your available XP. It is not physically possible for you to earn XP 
		anymore – there's nowhere for it to go! The first time you log in after 
		upgrading to the expansion, your total XP will be set to about 150 
		billion, you will advance to level 261, and you will receive 8 skill 
		credits. Note that you will <b><i>not</i></b> be at the new level cap of 
		275 – you will still have about 41 billion XP left to go to get there.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Okay, so that gets everyone on the same 
		page again as far as total XP is concerned. But what about going 
		forward? What happens when the first character reaches the new cap? 
		Currently, you stop earning total XP at level 126, but you continue 
		earning available XP until you eventually maximize all of your skills 
		and attributes and your available XP, at that point you stop earning 
		experience all together. With the Throne of Destiny expansion, things 
		will work fairly similarly: you will continue earning total XP and 
		available XP all the way up to the level 275 cap, and then you will stop 
		earning both total and available XP. This means that the next time we 
		want to raise the level cap, we can do it quickly and easily without all 
		of this fuss. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A technical note: Yes, this means that 
		the storage for available XP is also increasing to a 64-bit value. One 
		side effect of that change is that it will no longer be possible to lose 
		experience during skill sellback. Skill and attribute XP will remain in 
		32-bit values, with a maximum of about 4.2 billion. We're not prepared 
		at this time to deal with raising the maximum possible skill levels, 
		although we are seriously considering it for the future. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Augmentation Gems</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, if you've been paying close 
		attention, you may have noticed a small issue with all of this. It's 
		great that you'll be able to get to higher levels than ever before, but 
		what <b><i>use</i></b> are those extra levels? In AC, experience is only 
		useful if you can spend it on something. Since we're not increasing the 
		amount of total XP that can be invested into skills and attributes, then 
		in what way does the higher level cap actually benefit players? Is the 
		only purpose to give your character a slightly higher number to sport 
		around?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The answer to this question is twofold. 
		Firstly, a higher level means more skill credits, which mean more skills 
		trained and therefore more XP invested into skills. Note that you can 
		still only spend a total of 64 skill credits on specialized skills, so 
		those extra skill credits will probably be more useful in broadening 
		your character than in deepening it.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Secondly, we're introducing new ways to 
		spend XP called Augmentation Gems. These are special gems, somewhat akin 
		to skill sellback gems, that you obtain via a quest. Each Augmentation 
		Gem has a unique effect and an associated cost in experience. When you 
		use the gem, the experience cost is subtracted from your available 
		experience (only if you have enough, of course!), your character 
		receives the benefit, and the gem is destroyed. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All Augmentation effects are permanent, 
		some can be repeated and some cannot, but they cannot be undone – there 
		is no Augmentation sellback! On the other hand, with enough time and 
		experience, it is theoretically possible for any character to collect 
		all the Augmentations.&nbsp; It will take some time, however – we currently 
		plan on a one-month timer for completing the Augmentation Gem quest. 
		With more than 30 Augmentations planned, that's over two years of 
		character development.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It's important to note that Augmentation 
		Gems can be used by anyone who can obtain the gem and who has enough 
		available XP to purchase the Augmentation. In other words, you don't 
		have to wait until you are level 260 to use Augmentations. Note that the 
		quest to obtain the gem is targeted at characters of level 100+ and is 
		restricted to those players who have purchased the expansion. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Let's look at a simple example: One 
		potential Augmentation that we announced at Turbine Nation was the 
		ability to carry an extra backpack. Let's say that the cost of this 
		Augmentation is 4 billion XP. (This cost is subject to change, but it is 
		interesting to note that this Augmentation is planned to be one of the 
		most expensive available.) So you do the quest, obtain the gem, and use 
		it. 4 billion XP is drained from your available XP and invested into 
		this Augmentation, and now you have an extra backpack slot on your UI. 
		This slot is yours for the rest of eternity, and you can place any 
		backpack you like in that slot.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are in the process of finalizing the 
		list of Augmentations and their associate XP costs, but you can 
		anticipate more information on these effects in the coming weeks. </font>
		</p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Other Considerations</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">So that's the basic plan for
