	<p><em><font size="2" face="Arial">This is Part One of the November 2004 
	Teaser. You can find all four parts as well as four screenshots
	<a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=309">here</a>.</font></em></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An explosion of energy shook Reeshan from his 
	slumber. His eyes popped open as the purple glow of the tunnel illuminated 
	the chamber where he had been resting for these last few months. He had been 
	gathering his strength, waiting for the time when his chief Jerrugar, 
	Mgrauleshk, would complete his task. So much time had passed that Reeshan 
	had thought Mgrauleshk a failure in that task; but now, staring into the 
	dark violet swirl of the tunnel that had opened, he smiled a grim smile. He 
	knew that his Jerrugar had succeeded.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He shifted his massive weight from his 
	sleeping position and spoke directly into the minds of his brother Kings.</font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Brothers, the way is open and I have begun 
	my preparations. All shall fall before the might of our magic. None shall 
	live. The reckoning is at hand. At long last, we shall destroy the beings 
	who sought to slaughter our race in its infancy.</font></i></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Their response was as expected, a mixture of 
	thanks and well wishes, as well as reminders to enact the rite that would 
	bring the rest of the Kings through once he successfully established a 
	bastion against the false gods. Reeshan responded positively in turn, 
	allaying the fears that were raised; then he turned to the gateway and the 
	small contingent that he had brought with him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As he approached the swirling gateway, across 
	the vast divide, his mind wandered to the conclave only three cycles before.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The soul of the Ruuk dissipated until there 
	was nothing left but a thin trail of magical dust. Mgrauleshk ripped an arm 
	off the corpse of the Ruuk as he claimed it from the altar, and then, in a 
	savage display, he tore the flesh from the bone with his teeth. Browerk 
	croaked and closed his eyes; the other Kings followed suit as he spoke 
	directly into his brothers' minds.</font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Tkoruk Guruul is open, as are other small 
	outposts. Ruuk have taken our place in history. Morgluuk and Torgluuk have 
	crossed the vast divide and we are left to rot. T'Kuruul Reeshan shall be 
	the place where our march into history begins. Here we shall empower this 
	new Jerrugar, Mgrauleshk. He will be given the knowledge of the mucor, and 
	he will know how to coax the locations of the world's veins through sight 
	alone. We shall send him to Tkoruk Guruul where he will pass through the 
	tunnel and hunt down Morgluuk and Torgluuk, and then he will ride the vein 
	of the usurpers world to the place where the gate to T'Kuruul Reeshan is 
	found. He will open the way.</font></i></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a murmur gently rumbling between 
	the Kings as Mgrauleshk looked up from the carcass of the Ruuk. Before him 
	the Kings of his kind slowly swayed from side to side, making small noises, 
	allowing small trickles of magic to escape their porous flesh. He stripped a 
	bone free of flesh and thought for a second of standing and approaching 
	them, but the allure of the meat was too strong.</font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Reeshan shall walk through the tunnel 
	first, to meet his Jerrugar. If Mgrauleshk fails Reeshan shall accept defeat 
	and yield his life. This is how it shall be. We will return now and arm our 
	forces. Our vengeance comes after the lifetimes of your fathers' fathers 
	have long left this world. I recall the pale ones. I recall their twisting 
	influence. I recall the swamp dweller that came with them. I recall it 
	sinking into the depths and taking root at this world's heart. Now we are to 
	tear the heart out from their world!</font></i></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sudden eruption of sound jarred Mgrauleshk. 
	As one, the Kings pounded their massive staves onto the stone of T'Kuruul 
	Reeshan. As one again, they turned toward him with purpose in their eyes. He 
	met the gaze of his King, Reeshan, and for a brief moment he saw fear there 
	– then it was gone. Mgrauleshk's hands and face were stained with the blood 
	of the Ruuk carcass that lay empty and picked clean at his feet. His head 
	throbbed, a sharp pain struck him between the eyes and he fell to one knee. 
	Browerk slid his massive girth toward Mgrauleshk. As Browerk approached, 
	Mgrauleshk saw the King of all Bur pluck a mucor spawn from his hide.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Lift your head, Jerrugar Mgrauleshk. You are 
	to be given the greatest honor ever bestowed upon a Guruk.&quot; Mgrauleshk 
	obeyed Browerk and lifted his head. The King held forth the mucor spawn with 
	one small arm. &quot;Eat.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mgrauleshk ate and his world folded open in a 
	fever of color, sound and emotion. The world swam by him in years, seconds; 
	he felt the sound of death and the taste of defeat. There was an odd hum 
	that filled his head and nearly shook his eyes to jelly. He was jarred awake 
	by the mucor spawn and filled with the truth of the pale ones who had tried 
	to kill his race. He was reborn in an instant of fire, pain and illusion so 
	real that his mind was devoured and rebuilt with a new purpose.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Browerk issued commands and Mgrauleshk 
	nodded, accepting the duty that would redeem his race and enact vengeance 
	against a race of beings that had meant to exterminate their kind...</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reeshan hefted his girth through the tunnel 
	and was gone from Bur.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Olcris wiped a closed fist across his bloodied lip and 
    leveled his gaze at his assailant. The smaller creature looked ravaged by 
    some feral desire, yet it spoke clearly and demanded nothing more than a gem 
    to the school at Knorr. Olcris' eyes darted to the sickle strapped to the 
    thing's waist and saw that it was caked with dried Lugian and Tumerok blood. 
    He reached into the pouch at his side.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Here, take it. There's nothing there for you, though, 
    little one.&quot; Olcris sputtered the words through splintered teeth then tossed 
    a portal gem to the feet of the little fiend.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;I will find the pale one and rip out his innards,&quot; the 
    little fiend responded as it reached down to the gem. Olcris grimaced as he 
    shifted his weight, and he realized that the savage blows from the little 
    cretin were far worse than he suspected. &quot;The false gods will be punished.&quot;</p>
    <p><font size="2">Olcris smiled at the thought. This little creature was 
    looking for Asheron; it had to be. There were none on Auberean that came 
    close to the power of the gods. Nuhmudira was powerful, he knew that; she 
    was his teacher. But even she knew she was no god. Asheron, however, he was 
    arrogant and demanding and treated all the transplanted races on Auberean as 
    lesser beings. He lived as though he were a god. He should be punished. 
    Olcris watched as the little thing before him activated the gem. The Lugian 
    smiled and said, &quot;Good journey, little one.&quot;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2">*****</p>
    <p><font size="2">Torgluuk arrived on an arid island reeking of death. The 
    air coaxed moisture from his flesh and he felt weak. A burst of spores 
    exploded from his flesh but quickly died in the air to a host of other 
    spores that floated like bloated maggots in a tepid pool of water. Before 
    him stood a gate and a giant construct of shimmering ice. He approached and 
    withdrew his blade. The construct bade him stop, but the blood within 
    Torgluuk's body pumped hard as he grew ever closer to his goal. Though his 
    body was dying so far removed from the swamp, his resolve was strong and he 
    launched an assault at the glittering device.</p>
    <p><font size="2">His sickle slid off the side of the glittering man. The 
    creature slammed a massive hand into the Burun's stomach, doubling him over 
    in breathless agony. Then a voice called to him, in his own language.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;A moth ate a word. To me it seemed a piteous thing when I 
    learned the wonder a moth had swallowed, in darkness stolen...&quot;</p>
    <p><i><font size="2">A riddle, a riddle</i><font size="2"> thought 
    Torgluuk. &quot;A book, it is a book the moth ate,&quot; Torgluuk called in his 
    language. He felt his body washed in magic and transported to another 
    courtyard. The same dry air hung above him and he felt weaker still.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Before him there stood another shimmering man of ice. He 
    approached and listened to the crystal being. He answered the riddle and 
    repeated the transportation once more, and then once again, arriving in a 
    hall washed in a glowing violet light. Above his head energy crackled free 
    of some device that had once served as some sort of container. Several 
    benches lined the area and another being, crafted of the same crystal, stood 
    before him.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Greetings entity Torgluuk, categorized as Burun Ruuk. 
    Your arrival has been foreseen by Lord Asheron. I am to assist in restoring 
    your health and then I am to bring you to Lord Asheron so he may discuss why 
    you are here,&quot; Arikas stated as it approached Torgluuk.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Torgluuk croaked and reached for his sickle but his body, 
    crippled by this new dry air so far from the swamp, forsook him. He 
    collapsed in a heap in the courtyard of the Academy at Knorr.</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2">*****</p>
    <p><font size="2">A single point of light grew behind the figure. At first, 
    the figure was nothing more than a black line; then, as consciousness 
    returned and his vision began to clear, Torgluuk saw the deep blue eyes and 
    wizened, bearded face of Asheron Realaidain.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Asheron's hair was tied back with a simple leather strap. 
    His long slender fingers rubbed a soft wet cloth over Torgluuk's brow. 
    &quot;Thought we'd lost you there, little Torgluuk,&quot; Asheron spoke in Roulean. 
    &quot;I'm sorry, I've tried to master your tongue but it is beyond my capacity to 
    enact many of the syllables that you are able to create. I'm afraid that my 
    physical form limits my linguistics more than yours does.&quot; He smiled 
    genuinely as Torgluuk stared up at him.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;I see only light about you,&quot; Torgluuk croaked in Roulean.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Asheron nodded, &quot;I have been told that more oft than I 
    have wished, Torgluuk. There are some who once called me Lightbringer. There 
    are those that gave their lives to curse me with this... nearly endless 
    life. A blessing and a curse that you and I share I think, yes Torgluuk?&quot;</p>
    <p><font size="2">It was true. Torgluuk and his brother Morgluuk were 
    long-lived. They should have been dead generations prior to their arrival on 
    this world. Torgluuk remembered that he was here to kill this man. He was a 
    pale one, one of the beings that had come to his world so long ago. But he 
    had no hate for this man. Torgluuk saw only the blessing of the eye within 
    him. After the moment of reflection, Torgluuk nodded once.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Asheron helped Torgluuk to a sitting position. As he sat 
    up, Torgluuk realized that he was partially submerged in a tepid pool of 
    swamp water. Nearby, a gilded iron cage held a fully grown bomutur wasp. 
    Torgluuk realized he was hungry.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Asheron asked.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Weak, the air here...&quot; Torgluuk replied. Asheron walked 
    to the cage and waved his hand. A small well of mana appeared in the center 
    of his palm and the wasp fell to the bottom of the cage, sleeping. 
    </p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;The air is dry like this over the majority of my world. 
    You'll learn more about it in time.&quot; Asheron reached into the cage and took 
    the wasp out, offering it to Torgluuk. </p>
    <p><font size="2">Torgluuk devoured the wasp quickly, feeling much better 
    once the food filled his belly. Three days had passed since he had left 
    Niarltah and Muldaveus bloody, battered and dying in their citadel. His 
    anger had been so great that he left to find this pale one, a man whom he 
    now saw and whom he did not recognize as a pale one. There were 
    similarities; they shared the long fingers and sharply pointed ears. He 
    carried himself much in the same way, but he was different in temperament, 
    different in the way the he moved about the room and in the way he treated 
    Torgluuk. Torgluuk looked beside the tub of filth in which he rested and saw 
    that his sickle had been cleaned and placed on a low table beside him. 
    Torgluuk looked at the man who was walking to a high table and chair across 
    the room.</p>
    <p><font size="2">On the table, a setting of fruits and meats sat 
    unmolested; beside them a single candle illuminated a stack of books. 
    Asheron looked at Torgluuk and spoke again.</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;You are here to kill me. I do not blame you for your ire, 
    Torgluuk, nor can I make excuses for those that walked these lands before 
    me. I am alone in this world, more alone than any may ever realize. But, I 
    see that you have come from another world, like all those that now dwell on 
    Ireth Lassel. All drawn through portals of my creation, all save you and 
    your kind.&quot; Asheron paused and Torgluuk, feeling strength return, began to 
    climb from the tub. &quot;We are outside the realm of prophecy, and prophecy is 
    all I have had to live by for all my years on this world. I –&quot;</p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Prophecy?&quot; Torgluuk interrupted. &quot;Yes, I am familiar with 
    prophecy. Intimate with prophecy, I knew I was to come to this world. I knew 
    that I would walk here. I knew that this would transpire, as I have been 
    told about all of this... but is it prophecy?&quot; Torgluuk shook his head. 
    &quot;Three races, three races shall I walk amongst... and one figure alone...&quot;</p>
    <p><font size="2">Asheron chuckled. &quot;I am a man, long-lived, unique, and

    <p>&quot;...nothing. We've been able to enhance some qualities, but the slayer 
    aspect is not within our magical abilities.&quot; Ciandra bowed her head 
    resignedly, &quot;I am sorry, Elysa.&quot;</p>
    <p>Elysa smiled genuinely and spoke. &quot;Ciandra, why are you sorry? You've 
    discovered much. We're just missing this one piece, and we know that there 
    is someone that can help us with that aspect.&quot; She paused and looked around 
    the table. All the members of the council were present as well as a few 
    additions, most notably Jenavere and Hendac. &quot;There is nothing to be sorry 
    for. The Arcanum has done very well and other weapons will still hurt these 
    creatures.&quot;</p>
    <p>Antius bowed his head. He had been hoping that this would not come to 
    pass. But as more Burun crossed into Dereth from their world, the unrest 
    amongst the other creatures increased. The Renegades, having lost the 
    majority of their allies, seized the opportunity to stage quick and 
    successful raids along the borders of Isparian lands. Many outposts had come 
    under siege, but brave souls rallied to their defense and drove off the 
    insurgents at every turn. <i>At least some of the populace still recognizes 
    threats, </i>he thought. </p>
    <p>In the previous cycle of the moons, a particularly violent Guruk had 
    gathered troops to smash their way through a sealed door in the depths of 
    one of the Falatacot temples. There, a small organized group of Isparians 
    defeated the Guruk only to finish the Guruk's work for him. It was unclear 
    why Isparian turned against Isparian, but the meager force that tried to 
    protect the door was overwhelmed and another threat entered the world: 
    Reeshan.</p>
    <p>Jenavere and Hendac had examined the creature from afar, trying to avoid 
    its notice. They failed. They described the appearance of the creature as a 
    bloated mass of flesh that bore some resemblance to other Burun that they 
    had faced. Then they described their deaths, deaths more intense than any 
    they had experienced: they were debilitated, all of their equipment was 
    destroyed and their bodies reformed outside Holtburg.</p>
    <p>Elysa unrolled a map and pointed to a ridge outside of Uziz. &quot;This is the 
    last location where our guards have seen Nuhmudira. We know that she built a 
    small hovel here and has been living in exile since. However, our best 
    scouts have been unable to find that domicile. We believe that she has 
    discovered a way to veil her home...&quot; There was a low murmur in the room. &quot;Antius 
    has already agreed to take an offer to the people on my behalf. He will take 
    up position in Arwic for a few days and implore the people for assistance in 
    finding Nuhmudira.&quot; Antius felt his heart skip a beat. &quot;I'll offer what I 
    can in recompense. Ciandra?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot; Ciandra replied.</p>
    <p>&quot;In addition to supplying scrolls to the scriveners can you teach the 
    spells that enhance salvaging efforts?&quot; Elysa asked.</p>
    <p>&quot;Of course...&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Good, can you instruct a few of my guards to do the same?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I am certain that I can do this, why?&quot;</p>
    <p>Elysa smiled, &quot;I think that it will be a fitting reward.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Hogwash!&quot; Celdiseth said sharply. &quot;No, not the gifting of these spells. 
    I could care less about what you give people. I just can't believe you're 
    turning to that monster for help! It's bad enough that she's likely not even 
    human any longer.&quot; Celdiseth spat on the floor, an old custom to ward off 
    evil, &quot;But there's not a one of us here that doesn't think she tried to kill 
    you, Elysa. Turning to her is –&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Weak?&quot; Elysa snapped as she stood up. &quot;Let me tell you of weakness, old 
    man. Weakness is doing nothing. It is allowing these incursions to continue. 
    It is watching your people turn against one another and standing idly by. 
    Weakness is sequestering yourself in a remote area of the world and shunning 
    those that would seek your council!&quot; Her eyes burned with a deep passion and 
    her words were laced with anger and bitterness. Antius wondered how much of 
    this was aimed at herself and how much was directed toward Asheron, wherever 
    he was. Celdiseth was taken aback; the old man sat stunned as she continued. 
    &quot;What would you have me do? Watch as our homes are torn apart by ravaging 
    hordes because I bear a grudge without benefit of proof? Would you have me 
    let our people suffer because of my wounded pride?&quot; She paused and looked 
    around the table. Her gaze fell on Antius and he looked her in the eyes; 
    they shared a brief moment, then she continued. &quot;I still live. I did not die 
    to an assassin's blade. I will not see our people trampled beneath the feet 
    of raging hordes. If by showing Nuhmudira compassion and forgiving something 
    that may or may not have even happened, I can save lives and lessen the 
    suffering of the people who revere me as Queen, so be it. I will see that 
    happen before I let pride stand in the way of wisdom.&quot;</p>
    <p>The room was silent. Celdiseth calmly stood and walked toward the door. 
    &quot;Is it pride that keeps you from seeing that not all the people revere you 
    as Queen?&quot; He opened the door and left.</p>
    <p>Elysa broke the silence. &quot;This is the course of action that I am resolved 
    to; see it done.&quot; She rose and made her way from the chamber. A sullen mood 
    hung in the chamber and none spoke. In turn, each stood and left the table 
    until Antius was left alone.</p>

    <p>A well of gray-violet light and a piercing wail gave way to a dark room 
    reeking of the swamp. Mgrauleshk stood in the center of the room while a 
    host of Ruuk and Guruk battled smaller figures in the hallway beyond.</p>
    <p>&quot;Juruuka Jerrugar Mgrauleshk!&quot; Reeshan clucked as he welcomed his 
    general. &quot;Your duty is done and you shall forever be a hero to your people.&quot;</p>
    <p>Mgrauleshk bowed before his king and spoke low. &quot;We have much to discuss 
    of this world, King Reeshan.&quot;</p>
    <p>Without thought Reeshan expunged another small thing from his new 
    chambers. It walked upright and bore a metal carapace; it carried a sharp 
    metal stick and had traces of magic outlining its form. It was not a Pale 
    One. It looked nothing like the Pale Ones but appeared to be a threatening 
    little beast nonetheless. He washed the creature in magic and smiled as it 
    disappeared. &quot;Speak, Jerrugar.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;This world is bereft of the Pale Ones. They have not been found, not 
    yet.&quot; He paused and looked up at his lord. &quot;We have found ashes, bones and 
    blood. We have found dead that walk and spirits that live on. We have found 
    a race that look to be the Fiazhat and we have fought the Moar.&quot; He paused 
    again. Reeshan seemed uninterested; he was too busy happily disintegrating 
    the little things that threatened to enter his new chambers. &quot;The Moar here 
    are much weaker.&quot;</p>
    <p>A long moment passed before Reeshan responded, &quot;What of the other 
    temples?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;My gift has given me insight into the locations of each temple. I have 
    dispatched hosts to each location to begin tearing through the walls. Your 
    brothers will join you soon, King Reeshan.&quot; Mgrauleshk bowed his head again.</p>
    <p>&quot;You have served your purpose beyond expectations, Jerrugar Mgrauleshk. I 
    will see that your name is honored more highly than any other.&quot; Reeshan 
    chortled as another of the little beasts with metal carapaces disappeared. 
    &quot;Are all beings so weak here?&quot; Mgrauleshk nodded. &quot;Then we shall find the 
    Pale Ones quickly. Rise, Jerrugar, and tell me, what news of Morgluuk and 
    Torgluuk?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Morgluuk has been killed, my King. Torgluuk has once again been exiled. 
    We do not know where. We know that he fled.&quot; Mgrauleshk stood and watched as 
    a quizzical look crossed Reeshan's face. &quot;My King?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I killed that thing. I killed it and yet it returns.&quot; His eyes were 
    fixed on a little creature with a metal carapace, wielding a sharp metal 
    stick with traces of magic around its form. </p>
    <p>&quot;Yes. My King... the dead... the dead do not die on this world.&quot; 
    Mgrauleshk bowed his head.</p>
    <p>Reeshan slumped back on his tail and croaked loudly. &quot;Curious.&quot; He drew 
    the mana from within him and disintegrated the little beast again. &quot;Tell me 
    all that you have learned of this world, Jerrugar Mgrauleshk.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Yes, my King.&quot;</p><font size="2" face="arial"><font size="2">

	<p>At long last the page ran red with blood. Months of unending silence gave 
	way to a horde that rivaled the incursion of the Olthoi. Words scribbled 
	across the page; the prophecies began to form once again. Too long had the 
	book thirsted for blood; too long had its words lay hidden within. The 
	fragile fabric of the future spun from the web of the book's whim as the 
	dark past suddenly returned full circle.</p>
	<p>Another piece to a grand puzzle was played. Darkness gained another ally.</p>
	<p><i>Many of this month's changes have already been described in detail in 
	the Letter to the Players. Here are some additional topics that we'd like to 
	discuss in detail.</i></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>PKL and the Altar of Asheron</b></div>
	<p>Since the introduction of Player Killer Lite, there has been a bug that 
	could cause PKL combat to interfere with returning to NPK status from PK. 
	For example, if you turn PKL, kill another PKL player, then go PK, you will 
	be unable to go NPK despite the fact that you haven't committed a PK kill.
	</p>
	<p>This bug should be resolved for this event. PKL kills will not count 
	against the PK/NPK timer.</p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>Allegiance Info</b></div>
	<p>The @allegiance info command has always been on a timer to avoid frequent 
	repeated use by multiple players, which could bog down the server. However 
	it was put on the text spam timer, which meant that if you were near the end 
	of the timer and tried to use the command, the amount of time that you 
	needed to wait would increase.</p>
	<p>As of this event, @allegiance info is now on a flat 30 second timer. 
	Using the command before the timer has run out will tell you how long you 
	must wait before using it again, but the amount of time will not increase.</p>

    (Oct. 28, 2004)</span></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome 
	to the November Letter to the Players!</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last month in Dereth, Isparians discovered 
	yet another ancient Falatacot temple. Initially, the temple appeared to be 
	secure... but then a Burun Guruk named Mgrauleshk led a raid into the temple 
	depths.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the rally cry went out across Dereth, 
	Isparians had difficult choices to make. The barrier could not be reached 
	without forfeiting Asheron's protection. Some felt that Asheron's protection 
	was more important than pursuing the Burun. Some chose to hang back, waiting 
	to see what would happen next. Others dove ahead, attacking both Mgrauleshk 
	and the barrier. Some chose to defend the barrier from Mgrauleshk and their 
	fellow Isparians. A few decided to use this as an opportunity to settle old 
	grudges and cause mayhem.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The barrier fell, and an enormous and mighty 
	threat emerged. King Reeshan. One of the mighty Burun Kukurr. None could 
	stand before him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now let's take a look at some of the changes 
	coming in the November event and beyond.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But before we look at the future, let's talk 
	about a recent development that we're fairly proud of.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Turbine Billing</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">On Thursday, October 14, Turbine's new
	<a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=291">billing and 
	authentication system launched</a>. Since then we've had many new sign-ups 
	on our system, and these players are using Turbine's new launcher to log 
	into Asheron's Call.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We're very excited about this, and we hope 
	you are too. This is a major milestone for Asheron's Call, and for Turbine 
	as a company! In addition, we are one step closer to migrating all of our 
	existing players onto our new billing and authentication system. Keep 
	watching the Asheron's Call website for more info on the migration!</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are items that we plan to implement 
	in the November event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior articles. 
	These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that 
	we'll be introducing in the November event.)</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Asheron's Call's 5th Anniversary</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As you may know, November marks five years of 
	Asheron's Call. As the game started ten years after the defeat of the Olthoi 
	Queen, this marks 15 years of Isparian freedom on Dereth. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In celebration of this anniversary, the 
	Council of Sages will be providing all players with a small gift in the 
	November event. </font></p>
	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Please make sure that you leave one slot 
	open in your main pack before logging off for the last time prior to the 
	November event. Also make sure that your character is not at 300% burden. If 
	you are at 300% burden or have no available slots in your main pack at first 
	login after the event, you will not receive your gift.</font></b></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For scheduling purposes, the November event 
	is tentatively planned for Wednesday November 10.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Rapid-Fire Bow Bug Fix</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the early days of Asheron's Call, there 
	has been a bug with the projectile attack system and the animation system 
	that could allow a character to fire arrows or bolts <i>very</i> rapidly. 
	Recently there's been a surge in the number of players using this bug, 
	particularly on Darktide. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the November event, we are implementing a 
	fix to this bug. It will not be possible to fire any missile weapon faster 
	than its fastest speed, under any circumstances.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately it is not possible to directly 
	apply this fix to other animation-breaking bugs that we are continuing to 
	work on.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Salvaging Spells</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last month we introduced the new skill of 
	Salvaging, but not the Creature Magic spells to allow you to enhance this 
	skill. In November, you will be able to acquire spells to increase the 
	Salvaging skill. You'll be able to purchase the level 1 through 6 versions 
	from vendors, and there may be other ways to acquire them as well.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">PvP Weapon Changes</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In June of this year, we made a number of 
	changes to the Weeping, Hollow and Phantom weapons. After watching the 
	feedback on these changes and more internal testing, we determined that the 
	tools and data we had used to justify the changes were flawed. For November 
	we will be making additional changes in order to meet our goals.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The goal is to make all three PvP weapon 
	suites effective in combat, depending on the situation. A Weeping Weapon 
	used against a target that has been both Imperil'd and Vuln'd should be the 
	most effective. Next should be a Phantom Weapon against a target that has 
	been Vuln'd. Third should be the Hollow Weapons, as they ignore all Life and 
	Item Magic protection. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Within each suite, the most powerful weapons 
	should be those that cost the most skill points. However the cheapest 
	weapons should not be useless in PvP combat. In addition, there should be 
	some flavor among the weapons. For example, Mace and Axe cost the same 
	amount in terms of skill credits. Traditionally, Axes have higher maximum 
	damage and thus higher critical hits, while Maces have a tighter variance 
	and thus better damage over time. This was not true of the Weeping Axe and 
	Weeping Mace – the weapons were identical. In November, the weapons will be 
	changed to better match their traditional flavor.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In general, the damage on all Melee weapons 
	is being increased by some amount. Some of the Weeping Weapons will have a 
	lower damage statistic in November, but the Human Slayer quality is being 
	increased. The Weeping Sword, at the top of the stack, will not have the 
	critical hit damage that it had prior to the June changes, but its damage 
	over time will go up thanks to an improved variance. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Atlatls and Crossbows are also having 
	their damage increased. Unfortunately it was necessary to tweak the Bows 
	down very slightly in order to meet our goals. Bows will do smaller critical 
	hits than Swords in the same class, but have a higher average damage over 
	time.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Phantom Katar is a special case. As most 
	players know, Unarmed Combat weapons receive a damage bonus based on the 
	Unarmed Combat skill of the wielder. These weapons receive a smaller damage 
	bonus from Strength than other weapons, but at high levels the total damage 
	bonus is still quite considerable.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This causes the Phantom Katar, even with a 
	base damage of 0, do to extremely high amounts of damage at very high levels 
	of skill. When the Phantom Katar was first introduced in August 2002, a 
	special exception was made for the Katar's skill damage bonus. The skill 
	damage bonus for the Phantom Katar is currently one-half the bonus of any 
	other Unarmed Combat weapon.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">However, in our analysis this still leaves 
	the Phantom Katar overpowered. Its critical hits at high levels are more 
	powerful than any other PvP weapon at the same character level. Thus we have 
	decided to change the multiplier to the skill damage bonus on the Katar from 
	one-half to one-third. This brings it in line with the other Phantom 
	Weapons.</font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As has already been noticed, the mask and 
	guises quests, traditionally scheduled for October, were delayed this year 
	due to resource and priority issues. They have not been cancelled; they will 
	be available – along with some new ones – in December.</font></p>

	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=268#starterportals">
	September Letter to the Players</a>, as part of our plans to improve player 
	traffic through towns, we will be making a number of improvements to the 
	towns of Holtburg, Shoushi and Yaraq. Some of these improvements are 
	currently scheduled for December. These changes include adjustments to the 
	town portals in and around these towns, moving the three casinos closer to 
	these towns, and some new content to make these towns more attractive to 
	players at all level ranges. Some of these changes include revisions to the 
	newbie quests based out of these towns.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">In Concept</font></b></div>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we are 
	thinking about for January and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or even <b>
	if</b> – any of these changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and 
	priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the new quests, 
	dungeons, and items that we'll be introducing in each monthly event. Your 
	feedback on these topics is particularly valuable.</font></i></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">If not mentioned elsewhere in this Letter,

	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Creature War Magic</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In September we increased War Magic Bolt and 
	Arc damage at levels 1-6, and Streaks at levels 1-7, for the purposes of 
	increasing War Magic damage at lower levels. This also made a number of 
	creatures significantly more dangerous, as their War spells also did more 
	damage.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We've received a lot of negative feedback 
	regarding this &quot;side-effect&quot;, but also a lot of positive feedback. Many 
	players are upset that they cannot survive in their old hunting grounds; 
	many players are excited by the increased challenge.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What we would like to do is to examine 
	war-casting creatures on a case-by-case basis to determine if their risk is 
	still acceptable compared to their reward, and if not, whether the risk or 
	the reward should be changed. Unfortunately our schedule will not permit us 
	to do this for some time. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We currently expect to begin adjusting 
	creatures in groups starting in the next few months, be sure to watch future 
	Letters to the Players for future updates. We're committed to making sure 
	that creature risk is worth the reward, but we also do not want to rob 
	players of an enjoyable challenge.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There you have it, our current plans for 
	November and beyond. See you in Dereth!</font></p>
