      November 9, 2001</font></p>
      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">The loud sudden rumble of thunder was followed
      by a gasp and then a predictable shattering of porcelain on the rough
      stone floor. She would miss the pot, its once vibrant cerulean streaks
      long since faded to grey, but the tea that now pooled darkly on the floor
      was no loss. She had not had any worth drinking in over twenty years, and
      no crimsonthorn blend would ever be coming from Ispar. This Aluvian swill
      had become tolerable, over time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She dismissed the shaken serving woman and
      her apologies, though not unkindly. It was the nature of people to be
      surprised easily. That was why she was necessary, after all. She twined a
      single thread of silver hair around her gnarled finger. Once the hair had
      been a lustrous red, and the finger elegant and smooth. She would not be
      here forever. But it would have to be long enough.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I have found one suitable for your
      wishes.&quot; The voice came from behind her. She had not heard him enter,
      nor was she aware of his presence until he spoke. It was annoying, that;
      but she had not stirred at the words, and she knew that annoyed him though
      he would never show it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lightning flashed outside as the rain first
      started to reach the castle. She turned slowly to face her visitor.
      &quot;You could have been seen,&quot; she said, more to release some of
      her irritation than any actual concern. He merely smiled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She stood, not as swiftly or easily as in
      years past, but without tremble or pain. She wanted to look him in the
      face for this. &quot;They will call me worse than 'Monster' should I be
      discovered at this game.&quot; First her petulance, and now doubt. What
      benefit age if one was still afflicted by the weaknesses of the young?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;They already do,&quot; he whispered,
      that damnable smile never leaving his face.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Aye, true enough.” Would this be
      easier if she were younger? “It matters not. We do what we have to. Let
      the fools play with the infant queen. Let the Arcanum busy itself with the
      how of disruptions to portalspace instead of the why. We will not be
      diverted.&quot; The horror of her intent paled against the horror of her
      inaction. She tried not to think of the book. And how it filled her dreams
      some nights. It was not about the book. This action is what Dereth
      required.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Bring him to me.&quot; She knew it
      would be a man. He would never bring her a woman for this. The smile
      disappeared as he nodded once and stepped back into the shadows of the
      dark room. She never heard her door open, but she knew he was gone.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Light filled the chamber as the cacophony
      of thunder resonated throughout the castle. She sat back down as the
      echoes of light faded from the room. A storm is come. The storm is coming.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rain. He marveled at the rain. Wetness
      falling from the sky. A free and precious gift from the world. He wondered
      if it was possible that he could have ever taken the rain for granted. Had
      he ignored it? How foolish he had been.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The water continued to fall to the earth,
      each drop soaked up by the greedy dirt. But in a very few places the earth
      had had her fill and regurgitated the water back onto ground, letting its
      murky pools sit softly on her surface. He thought it was a fit metaphor
      for his situation. Except that he would not sit softly.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He knew Martine would be late. It would be
      his way of displaying superiority. And, indeed, he was superior. The man
      could not deny Martine's power. He depended on it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lightning illuminated the small copse of
      trees he had taken shelter in, turning the trees and ferns to bleached,
      bone-colored ghosts of themselves. And in the white aftershock of light
      and sound, a violet shimmer appeared, coalescing before him into the
      figure he'd been expecting.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Physically, Martine seemed the same as he
      had appeared in previous meetings. But the glassy, disjointed look in his
      one human eye was new. Martine grimaced and muttered something too low for
      the man to hear. The man had suspected for awhile that the madness was
      worsening, but he wondered at what contingency plans would suffice should
      Martine prove too unstable. There were none. The man waited, knowing
      Martine would eventually speak.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You continue to waste my time. You
      still have not provided me with the location. Where is he?&quot; Martine's
      voice sprung directly into his mind. The man sighed. He thought they were
      beyond this nonsense.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Forget him, Martine. He is useless
      and old. Do not lose sight of your goal. It can happen. I can make it
      happen, once you assist me. Remember that. Remember what I can do for you.
      Why engage in a fool's chase when all we could want is before us and near
      in hand?&quot; The words had their intended effect. The vocal muttering
      stopped, and there was once again a hard and focused gleam in Martine's
      eye.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We have an agreement, then?&quot; The
      man tried to keep most of his eagerness out of his voice, but not all. Let
      Martine concentrate on how he could exploit the man. That kept him from
      concentrating on other things.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine looked at him and raised his one
      eyebrow. The man almost laughed at this one human trait in someone who so
      little resembled one. But when laughter risked death, it was easy to bring
      under control.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;An agreement? That would imply we are
      equals. I make no bargains with you, lesser. You will eventually provide
      to me what you have promised, or I will destroy you. There is your
      agreement.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And have you accomplished it?&quot;
      The man had to shout over the boom of the thunder. While Martine could
      talk into his mind, he couldn't read from it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;It has begun. The process will take
      some time.&quot; Martine turned away, perhaps upset over this admission to
      the limits of his power. &quot;I will come find you again when it has
      finished.&quot; Martine raised his hands and disappeared in another
      shivering blast of violet.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The man moved to the spot where Martine had
      been. How strange that for all his power Martine still relied on these
      physical gestures, like a child that still crawled after it had finally
      gained the strength to walk. Lightning flashed bright overhead, and for a
      brief time the man was once again lost in amazement at the beauty of the
      world. How rich and vibrant it was.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But this world was so very empty. He would
      fix that. As the rain soaked into his skin, and thunder assaulted his
      ears, he reveled in the storm. He reveled in the thought of the storm to
      come.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

      Roll Out Article</b> - </span>From the <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEeventrollout.asp" target="_blank"> Zone</a>&nbsp;</small><br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2">November 15, 2001</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Virindi have been defeated, and their
      allies, the Tumeroks, have retreated to the desert and Direlands from
      whence they came. The Virindi fortresses, marring the skylines of the
      capital cities, have been banished with the defeat of the rogue
      contingent, their taint removed at long last.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a time of great joy. Housing
      settlements established by the Zaikhal Arcanum are filling quickly, yet
      the Order continues to fund the building of more homes. To further assist
      new deed holders, the magi of the Arcanum have established a system of
      portals to housing communities, and placed them throughout the established
      cities. Each system is easily recognized, resting beneath the watch of a
      stalwart sentinel.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the demand for houses increases, the
      Arcanum and their agents have made efforts to beautify the communities
      they have built. They have transported trees and added fountains to the
      central square to enhance the community feel. To assist in the growth of
      these communities the Arcanum has lifted the ban on trading the Writs that
      they supply.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth has entered a new age of growth.
      Expeditions to Marae Lassel have yielded impressive rewards, with
      adventurers hunting together in greater numbers for the experience of a
      day shared in the fellowship of friends. These forays are bolstered by
      comrades-in-arms, new and old, banding together with crossbowmen and
      macers, respectively faster or lighter on their feet than before. New
      qualities to weapons, armor, and jewelry have further eased the hunt by
      including a way for users to gauge the mana remaining in an item.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even the tales of a new Olthoi Brood Queen
      cannot dishearten the spirits of the Isparians. The efforts of Queen
      Strathelar and the Zaikhal Arcanum have given the people a new hope that
      they cling to with a ferocity they have not displayed since the time of
      the Hopeslayer's defeat. There is nothing they cannot face.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the horizon, storm clouds gather.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most
      interesting additions made to the game this update. However, please note
      that not everything has been included--that would spoil the fun of finding

      criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades

      <img alt="The Dev Notes" src="Chains/img_painting.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="120"><font face="Arial" size="2">Here 
      are just some of the additions made in the November 15 game update, “The

    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>New Functionality </b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monarchs of large allegiances can now 
      purchase Mansions on the landscape. Monarchs can use <i>/house guest 
      add_allegiance </i>to allow all their allegiance into their Mansion and <i>
      /house guest remove_allegiance </i>to remove them all and turn this 
      function off. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players now get significant bonuses in 
      earning experience points while in fellowships. The percentage of 
      experience points one gets is in proportion to the size of the fellowship. 
      See the November
      <a target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEplayerletter.asp">
      Letter to the Players</a> for more details. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Magic items now display “Mana bars” below 
      the name of the item when selected. This makes it easier to determine the 
      Mana remaining in an item. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Owners of houses can now use <i>@house 
      hooks on/off </i>to turn the visibility of their hooks on and off. </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements and Changes </b>
    </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month we fixed a longstanding bug 
      where certain monster generators in dungeons randomly stopped spawning. 
      There were no cases of “broken” dungeons reported in October, so we 
      believe this bug has been laid to rest. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug where certain high-level 
      monsters could spend their earned xp to raise their skills with extreme 
      speed, potentially making them nigh-invulnerable to players in a short 
      amount of time. These monsters have been flagged in such a way that they 
      no longer gain experience points. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Mosswarts were sad because all the 
      other semi-sentient races were getting makeovers and they weren't. Now 
      they are less sad. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The hit points regeneration rate for 
      characters has roughly tripled. The Stamina regeneration rate has 
      increased slightly. Mana regeneration rate remains untouched. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Server-side checks have been introduced so 
      that players' spells or healing kit attempts are interrupted if they move 
      too far from their starting point when they began their action. As a 
      result of this fix, the limitations on jumping too frequently have been 
      removed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are 150 new Cottages in the game.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Writs are now givable. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New portal networks have been added to 
      Dereth, allowing easier access to many housing settlements. These housing 
      settlements now have official names. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Cottages now contain 50 total hooks, 25 of 
      which are usable at any one time. Villas and Mansions will undergo similar 
      makeovers in the next few months. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most weapons, and some other items in the 
      game, can now be displayed on house hooks. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">NPCs, except for Town Criers, will no 
      longer “eat” items that they don't know how to respond to. They will 
      instead give these items back, letting you know that they can't use them. 
      Town Criers will still accept any item, allowing you to dispose of 
      unwanted equipment, so be cautious when interacting with them. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most town vendors now have their function 
      (e.g., “Bowyer”,“Blacksmith”) in their names. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@help </i>files have been given an 
      extensive revamping. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Nighttime visibility has been increased.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Dabus, maces, morningstars, and tofuns 
      have had their burden reduced. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most thrown weapons have had their burden 
      reduced. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Crossbow's reload time has been reduced.
      </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Minor Details </b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a problem where players' 
      characters other than their house-owning character would log in and 
      receive a message stating that their house had been lost due to 
      non-payment of maintenance. The message was erroneous, and the message bug 
      has been removed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Mansion placed in the Dires has been 
      removed. At present all housing will be placed in Osteth. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Housing hooks have new art. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Many existing housing settlements have 
      been gussied up. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Radar coordinates and spell durations are 
      now the default display options. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The bug where using the “Give Selected” 
      keyboard shortcut crashed the client if the selected person had logged off 
      has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Inventory panel now functions smoother 
      with the stretch UI. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Certain dresses and certain robes will now 
      have unique colored icons when dyed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Blackfire Atlan weapons now have a new 
      particle effect. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The two Canescent Mattekar robes have been 
      graphically updated. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The thrown vision of Railrea's harpoon had 
      a description for a spear, not a thrown weapon. This has been fixed.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Siraluun unarmed weapon had a bug 
      where it was not enchantable. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tumerok landscape invasions and the 
      Virindi towers have been removed. </font></li>

      Developer's Notes</a>. We also wanted to give players a few peeks ahead at

      important topics as we head into our November event,
      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEeventrollout.asp">
      The Gathering Storm</a> : </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>I. Gameplay </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>a. New fellowship system--</b>Over the past year we've wanted to find 
    ways of making fellowshipping more attractive to the general player base 
    without hurting a soloist approach to the game. This month we introduce a 
    brand new dynamic to <i>Asheron's Call</i>: bonuses to experience points 
    earned while in a fellowship. The system works in the following manner:
    </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">2 players in fellowship earn 75% of normal 
      experience (previously 50%). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">3 players in fellowship earn 60% of normal 
      experience (previously 33%). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">4 players in fellowship earn 55% of normal 
      experience (previously 25%) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">5 players in fellowship earn 50% of normal 
      experience (previously 20%) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">6 players in fellowship earn 45% of normal 
      experience (previously 17%) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">7 players in fellowship earn 40% of normal 
      experience (previously 14%) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">8 players in fellowship earn 35% of normal 
      experience (previously 12%) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">9 players in fellowship earn 30% of normal 
      experience (previously 11%) </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: Currently the xp formulas shown in the 
    fellowship panel do not correctly display this information. This should be 
    fixed in the next event. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This bonus occurs only in groups where the 
    players are within 5 levels of the group founder, or if all players in the 
    group are above level 50. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We hope that this makes adventuring in 
    fellowships a more fun and viable option. While we respect the desires of 
    people to play our game without companions, we also recognize that a large 
    part of the fun of <i>Asheron's Call </i>is playing with friends and meeting 
    new people, and we think this change allows more people to experience that 
    type of gameplay. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>b. New regeneration rates--</b>As the game 
    of <i>Asheron's Call </i>grows and progresses, certain design dynamics have 
    become outdated. The hit point regeneration rate has become one of those 
    antiquated systems. We wanted to decrease downtime, especially the downtime 
    for those without life magic who also don't have healing. We think we've 
    struck the right compromise with the current hit point and Stamina regen 
    rates. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>c. Mana bars (think Health bars, but for a 
    magical item)!--</b>We've long wanted a way to make the process of 
    monitoring Mana totals and Mana depletion in magical items easier. We 
    finally managed to fit a solution in this month. We hope you enjoy the 
    change. This is also the beginning of the first of many steps to move the 
    focus of the appraisal skills away from appraisal and more into a whole new 
    realm of different and more useful abilities. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>d. NPCs no longer stealing items--</b>One 
    of the more frustrating things that the Quest Designers have to deal with is 
    trying to fathom what possible items people might try to give an NPC, and 
    then scripting these exchanges. All too often, we fail to think of an 
    obvious item, leading to a very upset player who can't get it back from the 
    ignorant NPC. This dynamic also led to some of our more wacky or “bonus” NPC 
    exchanges never even being found, because people didn't like to risk the 
    loss of certain items. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the November event, NPCs will now give 
    back any items that they don't have a scripted response for, fixing both of 
    these concerns. The one current exception to this dynamic remains the Town 
    Criers, who will not return any item given to them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>e. Newbie love--</b>We've implemented a 
    number of changes to improve the new player experience (and will also make 
    the game more fun for all players): </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Making the nighttime brighter with more 
      visibility; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Letting people identify a vendor's 
      function through his name; </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Updating the @help text system with new, 
      useful, and accurate information. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And coming soon, the new player situation 
    will really change. . . </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>II. Housing </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>a. Writs of Refuge--</b>You'll see a whole new way of acquiring Writs in 
    November. These changes, combined with the fact that Writs are now givable, 
    move the Writ system much closer to its intended design: a separate currency 
    system for players to acquire and trade as they see fit. We decided to make 
    them non-givable in October because we didn't want players who had the 
    benefit of being part of large social alliances to have too much of an 
    advantage over those who did not have access to these networks. But the 
    Writs will stay givable from now on. Tweaks will continue to happen from 
    month to month, but players should expect that each month there will be 
    multiple ways of acquiring Writs, both from trading in pre-existing 
    inventory, as well as hunting for newly introduced items. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>b. Supplies of housing--</b>For November, 
    we're adding in 150 Cottages. For the next few months after that, our goals 
    are an average of 300 additional houses per month, with some of those houses 
    being Villas and Mansions. During this time we will also be exploring 
    alternative methods of housing for players unable to obtain a housing 
    structure, so as to provide access to some type of housing and storage space 
    for all our <i>Asheron's Call Dark Majesty </i>players who desire it. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>c. Hooks and items to be placed on hooks--</b>We 
    knew we had to be cautious with how many hooks we placed in houses due to 
    server performance issues. This is why we started with only 15 per Cottage. 
    For November, we're happy to introduce a new system: There will be a total 
    of 50 hooks per Cottage. However, a player can only have items on 25 of 
    these hooks at one time. Once a player has used the 25th hook, all other 
    hooks turn invisible and cannot be used until a player opens up additional 
    hooks. Our goal is to allow players the maximum amount of flexibility in 
    decorating their homes. Players can also turn on the availability and 
    visibility of their hooks with <i>@house hooks on/off </i>commands. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, hooks aren't that valuable unless there 
    are items to decorate the home with. For November, most of the weapons and 
    shields and casting items in the game can be placed on hooks. We will 
    continue to expand the range of what can be placed on hooks with each month. 
    No-give or no-drop items are not hookable at this time, and there are no 
    current plans to implement this in the near future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>d. Allegiance houses: Mansions--</b>This 
    event sees the opening of the first allegiance houses. Currently, these are 
    limited to monarchs of rank 6 or above only. They can then open up these 
    houses to their entire allegiance. Further, if the monarch ever drops below 
    rank 6 or is no longer a monarch, the monarch and the allegiance will lose 
    the Mansion (including all items in hooks and in storage) by the next time 
    the maintenance payment is due. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Coming soon, we will allow monarchs to open 
    up their Mansion's storage chests to the entire allegiance, and we will 
    develop further features for allegiance housing in the next few months.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>e. Transportation to houses--</b>In 
    addition to the house recall functionality, for November we've added new 
    portal networks linking towns to most of the housing settlements in the 
    game. We believe this will address many players' concerns regarding inviting 
    guests to one's house or traveling to the houses of friends and allies. In 
    the upcoming months, portals to settlements will generally lag behind the 
    creation of those settlements by one month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For Mansions, soon we will be altering the 
    dynamic slightly. In addition, for all types of houses we will experiment 
    with new and interesting ways for players to give their guests and friends 
    transportation access to their houses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also coming up in a near future event, we 
    will investigate letting all characters on an account be able to use <i>
    @house recall </i>functionality. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>III. Melee and Missile and Magic, Oh My! </b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <b>a. Archery and thrown weapons issues--</b>This month sees the first step 
    in some small balance tweaks to archery over the next few months. After 
    numerous tests and playing at various levels on our test worlds, we decided 
    to make a change to the reload speed for crossbows. Coming soon, there will 
    be other changes made to the game specifically designed for higher level 
    archers, both bow-users and crossbow-users alike. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, and this is not a joke, by the time we 
    get done with these changes, Thrown Weapons might just be an actual viable 
    skill. You heard it here first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>b. Mace and other melee weapons--</b>While 
    the reduction in mace burden was long overdue, our next set of changes to a 
    large percentage of melee weapons will not take nearly so long. Expect to 
    see an exciting and entirely new dynamic over the next few months with many 
    of the melee weapon classes. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b><font size="2">IV. Player vs. Player </font></b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <b>a. “God-Mode”--</b>With the change this month to jump/run casting, we 
    hope we've addressed one of the longest running issues in the PvP AC world. 
    We may continue to make tweaks to this dynamic over the next few months. 
    We're very happy to take out the awkward jumping restrictions, which was our 
    “temporary” fix, although it lasted much too long. We've dropped the ball 
    here, and we apologize to our players for taking so long to fix this issue.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>b. Hollow weapons--</b>We're working on a 
    solution to the problems of both the “Katar vs. other Hollow Weapons” 
    discrepancy issue and the “Hollow Weapons vs. Magic” discrepancy issue. We 
    plan to have a definitive solution in place within the next few months.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b><font size="2">V. Miscellaneous Bugs </font></b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    <b>a. Dungeon-spawning bugs--</b>Another very long-lasting problem that 
    affected a lot of players' gameplay was the infamous “The [insert favorite 
    dungeon here] is completely empty and no monsters are spawning!” bug. We 
    wanted to wait to confirm the fix after we were sure that it survived a 
    month in the live worlds, and after having zero verified reports in October 
    of dungeon monster spawn breaking, we're happy that this bug has finally 
    been resolved. (We also thought that we had removed Larry the Bunny Master's 
    wanderlust, but alas, Larry still can't commit to home. Maybe this month. 
    Would you believe the disappearances are part of the Quest?) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>b. Monsters becoming invulnerable, or “The 
    Harry Defense”--</b>It's a long and interesting story about why this bug 
    occurred in the first place. A story full of good intentions and cruel 
    consequences. A story of love and hope slowly transforming into bitter 
    despair. One day we may reveal the incredible truth. For now, just know that 
    the high level monster who just resisted your Magic Yield three times in a 
    row won't suddenly become Uber-Creature anymore. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We were going to remove the possibility of 
    any monster leveling, but enough people begged and pleaded to change our 
    minds. “Think of the rabbits!” they cried. “Think of the children!” And so 
    the masses may still level up rabbits. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>c. Singularity weapons quest--</b>Yes, 
    there were supposed to be Singularity Bows and Crossbows and Racial Weapons 
    obtainable on the mainland in order to be exchanged in the new expansion 
    Singularity Quest. Yes, these weapons were supposed to be in for October. 
    Yes, failing that, they were even supposed to be in for November. Yes, it is 
    true that they made appearances neither of these times. However, we have a 
    strong suspicion that these items, while shy, will overcome their reluctance 
    to enter the public spotlight and be seen in a future event coming soon.

    <p><span class="Head"><b><font size="2">VI. December's Event and Beyond. . .

    <br>
    It's an exciting time to be playing in Dereth. We hope those of you who have 
    purchased <i>Asheron's Call Dark Majesty </i>are enjoying the new island and 
    housing. And we hope that all of you are enjoying the changes and new 
    gameplay dynamics that we have introduced for November. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Things will really start shaking with the 
    December update. As Martine's and Nuhmudira's plans become more clear, and 
    Elysa striving to marshal the forces of her kingdom against foes both known

    compelling storyline. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The plotting and scheming of some of Dereth's 
    highest luminaries will not leave the continent unscathed. . . a brand new 
    beginning for new players and an extensive revamping of the higher ends of 
    the treasure system are just two of the exciting changes coming your way 
    very shortly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In future months we will focus on satisfying 
    the demand for housing amongst the players, as well as adding some very cool 
    features to add to your house. Another major push in the next 4-6 months 
    will be the revamping of our appraisal and craft skills, adding in some 
    wonderful new gameplay, and finally making those appraisal skills worth 
    their cost. And there might be a surprise or two as well. . . </font></p>

    you for being a part of our game, and taking the time to share with us your

      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial" size="2">November 1<span lang="en-us">6</span>, 2001</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the last few weeks, a few players have 
      engaged in hacking their clients and sending messages to our servers for 
      the purposes of crashing those servers. Using our server logs we have 
      identified and removed those people from <i>Asheron's Call</i>. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although we cannot always go into detail 
    about the specific nature of the exploits or their fixes, we do understand

    injustice, and we are committed to providing you that type of gaming 
    experience every month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the consequences of the crashing 
    servers was the repeated appearance of a major bug in which players' items 
    on hooks and storage disappeared entirely from their houses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before November's event we had performed a 
    hotfix which we thought would solve this problem. Unfortunately, a server 
    crash on Darktide soon after the hotfix showed that the bug continued. We 
    made some additional code changes for the November event to fix this 
    problem, but we are still getting reports of this nature. From the various 
    instances of the problem, we have received a number of informative player 
    reports, which we are currently investigating. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Today we will be paying the maintenance costs for all the 
    houses' first month period on all servers. Due to a bug on Darktide that 
    occurred as a result of our &quot;speed-wand&quot; fix, players have been unable to 
    pay maintenance costs to their Covenant Crystals for the last five days. As 
    some players who bought houses when they first appeared will soon have their 
    first month's maintenance due, we decided to not risk someone losing their 
    house because they were unable to interact with their Crystal for that time 
    period. We then decided to pay housing maintenance on all servers due to the 
    recent instability this weekend of some of those servers, and the problems 
    that may have resulted from that instability. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Please note that players will still be responsible for the

    start as early as this Friday. </font></p>

    are sending to
