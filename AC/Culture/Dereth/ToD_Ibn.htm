        <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbine.com/index.php?page_id=354">Turbine Site</a> 
		- Feb. 24, 2004 - Ibn's Write-up</font></span><div>
          <strong><em><br>
          </em></strong><i><font size="2" face="arial">On Thursday February 17, Turbine held 
          its first-ever press event as an independent publisher, providing 
          demonstrations of <b>Asheron's Call: Throne of Destiny</b> and <b>
          Asheron's Call 2: Legions</b> to representatives from both print and 
          online media. This is&nbsp;Ibn's running account of the day, pieced 
          together from notes taken on&nbsp;his PDA.</font></i><p><b><font size="2" face="arial">
          8:15AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">Up and out of bed. The hotel we're 
          staying at, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hotelgriffon.com/">Hotel Griffin</a>, 
          is literally next door to the location of the event,
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shanghai1930.com/">Shanghai 1930</a>, so there's 
          no travel time needed to get there. Jessica and I had flown in 
          yesterday and met up with the rest of the Turbine team at the hotel. 
          Argus, Citan and Ramen were there from the AC2: Legions team along 
          with Jason (Director of Corporate Communications) and Jim (Director of 
          Marketing). Over dinner we discussed the plan for the day, and I made 
          sure to get to bed relatively early. Flying takes a lot out of me and 
          I knew I'd need to be sharp today.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">8:45AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">We meet in the 
          hotel restaurant for our complimentary continental breakfast, as well 
          as some much-needed coffee for the folks who drink it. The weather is 
          pretty miserable – overcast and drizzly, with heavier rain expected 
          later in the evening.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">8:54AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">Jason asked us 
          to be at Shanghai by 9, so we head over. Our reserved space is 
          downstairs, in a part of the restaurant that's used as a private club. 
          The best way to describe the space is one word: <i>plush</i>. The 
          chairs are deep and soft and hard to get out of, and everything is 
          purple cloth or dark wood. The place is also a cigar club – on the way 
          in, someone points out that part of the collection is reserved for 
          Governor Schwarzenegger. We figure out what parts of the space will be 
          reserved for AC's demo and likewise for AC2's, so we start unpacking 
          boxes.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">9:15AM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Small problem – 
          the servers aren't here! The plan was to have two PCs – one would have 
          the February client and server running on it, and the second would 
          have the latest <i>Throne of Destiny</i> build running so that the 
          press could see the marked graphical improvement. I'd configured two 
          machines back in Santa Monica, and Ski-Dawg and I had packed them up 
          and shipped them out on Monday. We'd even received confirmation on 
          Tuesday that they'd arrived safely! Where were they?</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">I always like to prepare for the worst, so I'd also 
          installed both servers and clients on a company laptop that I'd 
          brought with me. In a pinch we could run the demo off of that, but 
          it'd be a lot better to have two machines.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">I call Ski-Dawg back in Santa Monica who checks the 
          tracking info and starts calling FedEx. This is when we discover that
          <i>no one's</i> cell phones work in the basement where we're setting 
          up.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">9:30AM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Servers found! 
          As they'd arrived a day earlier than the shipment from Westwood, our 
          host at Shanghai had put them into a different room. Whew! Jason needs 
          me to wait for our audiovisual vendor to arrive – we've contracted a 
          local company to provide rack-mounted machines to run the AC2 client, 
          about a dozen standard flat-screen monitors and three wide-screen 
          plasma screens for the <i>Throne of Destiny</i> cinematic, the <i>
          Throne of Destiny</i> demo and the <i>Legions</i> gameplay video. So I 
          go upstairs to wait for them to arrive with our equipment.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">9:45AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">Citan comes 
          upstairs to relieve me – he's done setting up the AC2 server, so he 
          waits for the AV vendor while I go downstairs to set up the AC and 
          AC:TD boxes. </font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">10:15AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">We've blown a 
          fuse and the AV vendor hasn't arrived yet, so I'm sitting on the 
          floor, in the dark, using our one monitor to set up the machines. The 
          February box comes up and tests fine, so I get to the task of 
          installing a newer build on the AC:TD box. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">We're at the point in development now where just 
          about all the back-end work is done so we're getting more client 
          functionality every single day. For example, between the Monday build 
          and the Wednesday build, we got the in-game radar, creature 
          examination and drag-and-drop hooked up. So Wednesday, right before we 
          left, I burned the latest client and server to CD and took them with 
          me on the plane. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">Now I'm unzipping these files and installing them so 
          that our guests will see the latest and greatest!</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">Two women from the PR firm that we hired are also 
          here to help out. While Citan and I have been testing equipment they 
          and the other Turbine folk have been packing gift bags for our guests.
          </font><i><font size="2" face="arial">(I just realized – I'm not even sure what was
          <b>in</b> those bags because I never got one for myself! Better 
          remember to harass Jason about that...)</font></i></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">11:00AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">Much improved! 
          We have lights, the AV vendor is here and is lugging equipment down to 
          our space, and the demo boxes have the right software and are running 
          fine! </font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">11:15AM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">All of our 
          equipment is good to go but it'll take a while yet for the AV vendor 
          to set up all of their stuff, so we take a break for lunch. Our hosts 
          provide the Chinese food. It's EXCELLENT.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">12:20PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> The vendors 
          are hooking up the 8 AC2 client machines, but I grab their attention 
          long enough to get the monitors, plasma screen and video splitter that 
          I need to get the AC:TD demo set up. We've switched around locations 
          so that the AC2 playable demo has enough space. The February screen 
          will be sitting on the bar, I'll be sitting behind it at the controls 
          of the AC:TD client. Video for the AC:TD box is split between my 
          screen and the plasma where Jess will be talking to the guests. You 
          can see a good picture of the setup on
          <a href="http://acvault.ign.com/screenshots/?ss=4166&amp;view=ss&amp;page=2&amp;cat=16">
          AC Vault</a>.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">2:20PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> OK! All the 
          hardware is hooked up, we only blew one more fuse, and we've done 
          trial runs through both presentations. Right now folks are playing the 
          AC2 demo. Three people from our distribution partner, Station 
          Publishing, have arrived and will be helping us with the event. 
          Everything appears to be going pretty smoothly!</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">3:00PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Back to my room 
          at the hotel for a break, also to shower and shave and put on my 
          &quot;nice&quot; clothes. I didn't want to be under a table hooking up PC cables 
          while wearing my dress shirt!</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">4:00PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> We gather in 
          the Shanghai again. The 8 AC2 clients have blown another fuse, so the 
          AC2 folks have decided to cut it down from 8 playable machines to 4 
          playable and 1 demo machine.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">Jess and I do the full presentation for the rest of 
          the team, who ask questions that they think are likely to be asked by 
          the guests. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">The presentation itself is pretty straightforward. 
          We start off with the February client standing just outside Glenden 
          Wood, and Jess explains that when we bought the franchise from 
          Microsoft the first thing we wanted to do with AC was give it a 
          makeover. She explains how we upgraded every single texture in the 
          game and completely rewrote the client graphic engine, and then says, 
          &quot;And here's how the game will look when we launch on May 11.&quot; That's 
          when she turns on the plasma screen showing the AC:TD client in the 
          exact same location, and everyone goes, &quot;Oooooh! Ahhhh!&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">While Jess talks about all of the improvements, I 
          run the character around Glenden Wood, showing off the improved 
          landscape textures, building textures, and skybox. Next, we teleport 
          to Sawato, where you can see the gorgeous new swamp trees and Sho 
          building textures. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">The next location is Sanamar, Viamontian capital on 
          Dereth. We walk up and say hello to the Viamontian town crier, noting 
          his blue skin, and then we run up into Sanamar proper. We pass through 
          the gates and run through the town, as the Great Hall looms on the 
          hill to our right. The statue of Varicci II casts its shadow down on 
          us as Jess talks about the Viamontians as both a playable heritage 
          group and the main adversary of the expansion pack. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">Then we portal to a frozen forest near the Shadow 
          Pass on Vanguard Isle, to show off some of the new creatures. A 
          Penguin slides up to me and starts swinging, but can't touch my admin 
          character. Jess mentions that there are bigger Penguins, and I spawn 
          an Uber Penguin. These are the Penguins that look like someone's spent 
          a million dollars upgrading them. They chain-cast. <i>It hurts.</i>
          </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">I spend a few minutes running around the forest, 
          being beaten down by Viamontian Knights and their fast two-handed 
          weapons, being blasted by Maddened Fiun spells and being gnawed on by 
          Eaters. Jess mentions that we've got new equipment to take on these 
          creatures – <i>rares</i>. So I smite or delete all the creatures 
          around me and show off some of the absolutely gorgeous rares that are 
          coming in the expansion pack. Shields like the Twin Ward and the Dread 
          Marauder. New armor like the Patriarch Coat (which is what happens 
          when you ask an artist for a new &quot;coat of armor&quot;). New weapons like 
          the gigantic sword named Morrigan's Vanity, the spiked mace called the 
          Star of Tukal, and my personal favorite: a vicious-looking axe named 
          Count Renari's Equalizer. Whoever finds one of these is going to be <i>
          very</i> happy.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">Then we take questions, and we're done. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">The plan is that we'll wine and dine our guests for 
          a while, and then we'll do the AC1 presentation followed by the AC2 
          presentation and playable demo. Afterwards we'll be free to answer any 
          more questions and show off any other features of AC:TD that we want 
          to show off. Our guests should start arriving between 6 and 6:30.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">6:38PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> It's 8 minutes 
          after &quot;arrival time&quot; and many of our guests haven't arrived yet. We 
          get word that the pouring rain has caused a number of accidents on the 
          freeways, making San Francisco's already-formidable rush hour traffic 
          even worse. Jason decided to tweak the plan on the fly – we'll do 
          demos for smaller groups, more frequently, so that the earlier 
          arrivals aren't waiting for the others. Jess and I do our first demo 
          for an editor from GameSpot. Two fansite reps have also arrived: 
          Kristopher from AC Vault and Tapuaua from AC2 Warcry. </font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">8:32PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Jess and I have 
          run the demo about a half-dozen times. We've got it down to a science 
          – when she's saying, &quot;Now let's show you Sanamar,&quot; I've already got 
          the command to teleport there typed out and ready to go. I'm thrilled 
          at the response from our guests – jaded gaming editors are looking at 
          the upgraded client and saying, &quot;Wow.&quot; I know I ate some appetizers at 
          some point, but it's all a blur of answering questions, running the 
          demo, and stopping every time I walk past the TV showing the AC:TD 
          opening cinematic. It's <i>just gorgeous.</i> If you've downloaded the 
          video that we provided on CD to our guests, think about this – <i>
          that's only the first half of the video!</i> Even though I know the 
          voice-over by heart I just can't stop watching it or listening to it. 
          &quot;The Duke and his daughter...&quot;</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">(Trivia: I auditioned for the voice-over. I didn't 
          get the part. Ah the challenges of trying to break into Hollywood! 
          J/K!)</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">9:16PM:</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Almost all the 
          guests have left. I'm playing the AC2 demo and manage to get my 
          all-but-unkillable demo character struck dead instantly. Citan laughs 
          at me. I think it's time to start breaking down and packing the 
          equipment.</font></p>
          <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">10:00PM: </font></b><font size="2" face="arial">All of our 
          equipment is packed and ready for shipping back to the Westwood and 
          Santa Monica studios. We're all exhausted but happy – the event went 
          really well, everyone seemed to have a good time, and both games 
          should get some great press coverage as our marketing campaigns roll 
          forward. Time to bust out the cigars!</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">We stayed at the Shanghai for another hour or so, 
          and then a bunch of us hit the town. As much as I'd love to publish <i>
          that</i> part of the record of the day, I don't think any of us want 
          that much blackmail material posted on the web. Ha! Luckily for me 
          Jessica tolerated my less-than-coherent state when she and I left for 
          the airport at 6AM the next morning.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="arial">In conclusion, I'd say the event was a success, 
          especially for Turbine's first independent outing. It was a lot of 
          work, both on the day of the event and the weeks leading up to it, but 
          it was also a lot of fun. The more press we get for these games, the 
          more characters we'll see in the world when we ship. This is a good 
          thing, for us <i>and</i> for you! Here's to the rest of the countdown 
          to launch going as well as the Press Event!</font></div>
