    <br>
    Asaina al-Arqis read late into the day, poring over ancient texts for some 
    reference to the gigantic bridgelike structure appearing and disappearing 
    over the river near Holtburg. At dusk, soon after she'd lit her candle, a 
    weariness stole over her that could not be explained by the warm spring air, 
    and she soon bowed her head upon the desk. When she finally awoke much 
    later, the larger moon had just begun to rise, and by its light, she could 
    see the dead candle with barely a dimple around its wick. She began to 
    stretch her arm, then stopped -- the desk was bare where her manuscripts had 
    been. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Something rasped on the floor behind her, 
      and she leapt from her chair. A bone-white figure clad in tatters emerged 
      from the stacks. Its attention was bent over a book in one hand, and in 
      its other, it held the missing parchments. Heart pounding, she cast about 
      for escape as it slowly raised its head, to reveal eye sockets like pits 
      floored with magma. She looked away. A lich! But who, and why? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The fools in Frore,&quot; said the undead 
    monster, &quot;made a toy of the prism, and now the old magic is loosed; the 
    suspended war resumes. Many hidden things will return, and the heretic will 
    kidnap and toy with your people. Reassemble the weapons and fight him, 
    Asaina al-Arqis. Tonight I let you live.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She understood none of this. &quot;Who is the 
    heretic?&quot; she asked, but received no answer, and realizing too late that she 
    should not look up, she stood transfixed by those burning eyes. The horror 
    of that stare lingered with its afterimage glow as the lich grinned, faded, 
    and was gone. </font></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></span></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Continuing our tradition of rolling out 
    monthly world-altering events for Asheron's Call, &quot;Shadows of the Past&quot; will 
    bring many changes to Dereth. Look for new features on the landscape, new 
    dungeons and quests, major new items, and even a new monster. Spring has 
    arrived, warm and welcoming, with its flowering plants, drifting motes of 
    pollen, and impressive new generation of rabbits, but rumors abound that 
    heroes have gone missing, and Shadow creatures remain on the landscape, 
    standing impassive as if awaiting a summons, while artifacts from an ancient 
    war begin ominously to reappear. Look for these developments by the end of 
    the week. We'll be seeing you in Dereth!</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Baby bunnies, drifting motes of pollen, and 
    new flowering plants have appeared, and sorcerers and workmen across the 
    land have been creating huge safe havens for public affairs, but nature and 
    humanity are not the only powers altering the world of Dereth. No one yet 
    knows the full consequence of the Quest for Frore, where bands of heroes 
    broke an artifact responsible for the land's killing winter freeze. For a 
    month, dreadful new Shadow creatures have been stalking the wilderness, 
    accompanied by floating crystals that launch pyrotechnic attacks. While 
    searching for guidance in ancient texts, scholars have found mention of 
    powerful weapons that once defeated the Shadows. But can they be recovered 
    before the battlefield is set? Already, a vast bridge of volcanic glass has 
    materialized over the River Prosper; mysterious new catacombs have been 
    discovered; and weary and bedraggled adventurers report harrowing trials at 
    the whim of a godlike, invisible being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Shadows of the Past&quot; continues our tradition 
    of advancing the Asheron's Call story through major monthly events. 
    Characters of all levels will find new mysteries to explore and challenges 
    to face in the common effort to oppose the massing Shadows. We look forward 
    to meeting you in Dereth! </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are all the tiny little details of the 
    game update that was made on February 17, 2000. This list is culled from 
    &quot;check-in&quot; notes submitted by the game developers themselves. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We won't reveal many changes concerning the 
    Shadows that have advanced upon the land and other story development, as 
    these include major new opportunities for players to drive the saga forward. 
    We don't want to take away the fun of discovery. As usual, the Town Criers, 
    Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the trades of crafting 
    and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items 
    are not always detailed here. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Detailed Notes for builds 2270-2277: </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spring has sprung. Pollen drifts, bees 
      buzz, and bunnies make baby bunnies. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The damage done by melee weapons -- such 
      as swords, maces, daggers, spears, and so on -- is now affected more by 
      the strength of the combatant. Strong warriors will find that they do more 
      damage per hit than before. This does not affect missile or unarmed 
      combat. Note that this applies to monsters as well, so be careful when 
      facing monsters that wield weapons! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players using melee weapons have a 
      slightly faster attack speed than before. This also applies to a small 
      subset of weapon-wielding monsters. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Amazing new things to do for all levels of 
      players, some of them worth many many hours of fun. If only we would tell 
      you what they are* </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New Meeting Halls, ideal spots for large 
      groups to gather, have been unveiled near every major town. The scribes 
      sell books that tell you where they are. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Anyone want to buy a bridge? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Loot has been improved for a few monsters.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Objects contained in corpses will no 
      longer be deleted by housekeeping (until the corpse rots and they are 
      dumped out on the ground). This may help fix reports of empty corpses, 
      though there still may be more to such reports, and we continue to 
      investigate. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mage robes are a bit more useful than they 
      were. They drain mana more slowly and cast another helpful spell. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gharu'ndim robes should now be wearable. 
      Other errors in mage robe names also fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Swift Killer spells 2-6 had wrong 
      descriptions. Spells worked properly, but the text for the spell 
      description had the old value by which the spell adjusted the item's 
      speed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The range of thrown weapons is now no 
      longer often displayed as zero. The range now assumes a Strength of 100, 
      though . . . your mileage may vary. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All Koujia Sleeves produced by the 
      treasure system will now be wearable. Unwearable sleeves that have already 
      been created, however, will remain unwearable. Please don't sell them and 
      continue the pain; drop them somewhere secluded, or give them to a 
      collector. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Explanation text on <b>Urgent Assistance
      </b>and <b>Abuse </b>panel has been modified. If your abuse report goes 
      unanswered, feel free to repeat it every few minutes until you hear from 
      an Online Team member. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">NPCs are now restricted to moving no more 
      than five meters when giving an item to someone. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug that made lightning 
      quarrels too easy to make, as compared to other elemental quarrels. They 
      are now just as difficult to make as their elemental cousins. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You are less prone to have your ability to 
      move curtailed by an automatic emote your character does while standing 
      around. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fletchers, start a-whittling . . . </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Typo in success string when making Carol's 
      Carrot Cheese Soup fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Double-clicking on parchment in a corpse 
      should now pick it up, not attempt to write on it. </font></li>

      Hello and welcome to the monthly Asheron's Call Developer's Chat. We will 
      start off with a few words from the Producer of Asheron's Call, Scott 
      Herrington, them jump into questions from you the players! Please have 
      your question pre-typed in notepad and ready to copy and paste when your 
      time comes. Questions must be limited to 1 question to give the most 
      people a chance to ask questions. If you ask more then one question, the 
      developers will only field your first question. So without any further 
      delay.. Scott, the floor is all yours: <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; Hi, and thanks for attending the chat! As was said, I'm 
      the Turbine producer on AC, Scott Herrington. I'll introduce the rest of 
      the staff here with me in a minute or two, but I want to say a few things 
      first. We're trying not to nerf players in this or any future updates. The 
      changes that we're attempting are just that, 'attempts' at fixing 
      problems. We don't always get it right, but we're trying. The changes that 
      we're making hopefully won't upset the balance of the game. We'd rather 
      boost player's abilities over a few months than go too far one month, and 
      have to nerf them the following month. With the complexities of a game 
      like AC, there's always a bunch of things to fix or improve. We prioritize 
      the problems and the events, so that we address severe problems first, and 
      then minor ones. Sometimes, we fix the minor stuff just because it can be 
      done quickly - or by a person who isn't working on another problem. With a 
      limited staff, allocating the resources to fix problems is the biggest 
      challenge we face. In the February event, we're trying to help our warrior 
      players a bit. That's all I can say about it for now, but I think they'll 
      be happy with the changes. We rely on your feedback to make sure that 
      we're moving in the right direction with our updates... So keep posting to 
      the message boards. We do read them - even if we don't post often to them!
      <br>
      <br>
      With that said, I'd like to introduce the Turbinites' who come up with the 
      events, design dungeons, and in general, bust their butts on a monthly 
      basis to give you new stuff to do! Eri Izawa is the head of the content 
      team. She oversees all the content people and the general structure of 
      each event. Without her, we'd all be lost! Chris L'Etoile, many of you 
      know by his plan file. Often controversial, he's really not nearly as 
      cranky as his plan suggests. He's responsible for a lot of the writing you 
      read or hear in the game, as well as the immense Frore quest from 
      December. David Javier is a recent addition to the content team, and for 
      some reason, is facinated by the story surrounding Neydissa Castle and 
      vows to continue that storyline no matter how late he has to work. Jesse 
      Kurlancheek is also relatively new to the team. He's half-content, 
      half-programmer, and all... erm... all good. Yeah, that's it. Chris 
      Foster, the lead designer, couldn't be here tonight. He's on a press tour 
      in Europe. (yup, that's right, the game's coming out in Europe in March) 
      If you ask us questions about anything we don't have an answer to, we'll 
      say &quot;That's Foster's stuff, we don't know anything about that.&quot; There may 
      be a few other Turbinites lurking around who may pop up to answer a 
      question or two as well. Anyway, enough of my ranting. If any of my fellow 
      Turbanites have anything to add, do it now. After that, we'll move right 
      in to getting your questions answered. Guys? Anything to add? <br>

      What are you doing to improve melee warriors and when can we expect the

      and shield&quot; animations, so all melee weaps minus unarmed are going to 
      enjoy some more speed <br>

      enchanted with portal magic - like a Lifestone Recall Gem? </b><br>
      <br>
      letoile@turbine&gt; Not at present. That would defeat the purpose of them

      introducing more quests and adventures into the game <br>

      +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; badguy, your question <br>
      <br>
      badguymike&gt; i hope i dont tread into foster's domain here but i think that 
      a new server of any kind would breathe new life into the ac community, not 
      that it is particularly in need of revitalizing, but a fresh start would 
      be very fun imho. <br>
      <br>
      badguymike&gt; can you give any specifics on when you think the current 
      servers will become saturated and what will happen when they are? <br>
      <br>
      nei@turbine&gt; hold on... we seem to have developed a backlog <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; OK Jaggo's question: We don't necessarily see it as our role 
      to dispel incorrect rumors. <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; I'll take badguymike, while somebody else taks Jaggo <br>

      rei@Turbine&gt; Jaggo's question 2: On the other hand, if someone DOES find 
      the queen someplace, let us know.... <br>

      Scotth@Turbine&gt; We're pretty comfortable witht the performance levels on 
      the servers with the current crowds.... but once they go up a bit more...
      <br>
      <br>
      Scotth@Turbine&gt; we'll start looking into opening up more servers. <br>

      number. My complaint is: Why was Tremblant's Ivory Staff, a quest item, 
      made for rank 4+ only?! If I did the quest I should use the item without 
      having followers! So my question is: <br>
      <br>
      RoBz26&gt; Will there be more, quest items or things like houses that are 
      rank only? (Houses for having ranks is only a rumor) And think about

      Since it is improbable that they ran to Teth we know that they were 
      portaled in tportman&gt; via players tied to the exit of a nearby dungeon. 
      that has a lvl restriction on it's entrance of lvl18+. If lvl18+

      lvl's at teth, thereby reducing the frequency of the portal storms <br>

      trading is a big problem. The house situation will obviously help the 
      muling problem, but I suggest a trade window like the shop window that can 
      be opened between players to view trade items </b><br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; Ahhh yes Secure Trade! <br>
      <br>
      <b>Ginx13&gt; I'd also like to know if you care about this happening </b><br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; I got this <br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; The problem is a large one as we see it, but it can only 
      really be solved by education in the short term <br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; don't trade with people you do not trust <br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; use a 3rd party if need be....read the message boards, be 
      aware of scams.... <br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; we cannot help you if you agree to a trade and get burned
      <br>
      <br>
      Dave@turbine&gt; educate yourself, and you should be fine....be a wise 
      consumer <br>
      <br>

      +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; And our last question of the night belongs to Jmcginley1
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>jmcginley1&gt; Why doesn't armor effect the damage dealt by a spell? 
      Whirling Blade... <br>
      <br>
      jmcginley1&gt; for example is a huge blade shot at you chest. Shouldn't armor 
      help lessen the damage from that attack? <br>
      </b><br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; That is a very old issue, actually, and one we've struggled 
      with quite a bit. <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; (Really) <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; But at this point to change it would be to greatly nerf 
      magic, and we're pretty sure that this is probably not a good idea. <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; And despite the cries of &quot;nerf magic,&quot; we have to be very 
      careful on issues like that :) <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; done <br>
      <br>
      +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; I would like to thank everyone for coming to the Chat

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Dereth's heroes have defeated the undead 
	necromancers and shattered the ominous floating crystal with which they 
	drained the world's heat. Congratulations to Abrim of Morningthaw and his 
	intrepid band, who submitted the winning story about this quest.
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Their tale 
	has been immortalized in the Story of Frore book, now available from many 
	vendors throughout Dereth. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>And while you're out purchasing tomes of lore, be 
	sure to secure a copy of the valuable recipe collection that features the 
	names of the cooking contest winners.<br>
	<br>
	As a result of our heroes' successful venture into Frore, the snow has 
	started to pull back from the lowlands, and the snowmen have grown scarce.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;However, though the Gelidites have been weakened, they have not been 
	obliterated, and the Frore quest will remain a fixture in the game. 
	Characters of at least 20th level are encouraged to seek out the underground 
	city and harass its remaining fiends.<br>
	<br>
	With the retreat of winter, enigmatic shadows and levitating crystal 
	fragments have appeared in the wilderness. Also, adventurers are now finding 
	more loot on monsters, including a new kind of armor that's unusually light 
	and strong. Many sages are trying to make sense of these portents. Shi Kaifu 
	of AC Stratics, for instance, has compiled the scattered bits of Sudden 
	Season and Dark Thaw lore into an impressive research paper. While we can 
	neither confirm nor deny any of his conclusions, we certainly think they're 
	worth a look:<br>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.stratics.com/sections/lore/suddenseason.shtml">

	<br>
	Finally, as you may know, a group of archmages has collaborated on powerful 
	new items for defending the land, most notably a set of robes that enhance a 
	mage's ability in one school of magic by lowering his or her skill in 
	another. Archmages are notoriously jealous of their secrets, so whatever 
	news prompted them to cooperate must be dire indeed. We badgered them to 
	tell us what they fear, but they only reply that February will be an 
	interesting month. We'll keep you posted.<br>

	EVENT PAGE<br>
	Our event page is gaining momentum slowly but surely. In the last few days, 
	players on Leafcull organized a major excursion to the Skeleton Castle, and 
	coinciding with the recent Dark Thaw event, The Chosen allegiance on 
	Harvestgain held a Winter Thaw Festival, which involved a footrace, a 
	cooking contest, a &quot;grand&quot; scavenger hunt, a raffle, and some improv comedy.<br>
	<br>
	Remember, when submitting an event or a gathering to be published on our 
	calendar, please . . .<br>
	<br>
	1. Submit the event at least three days before you intend to run it.<br>
	2. Be sure that your event abides by the Code of Conduct and the End User 
	License Agreement. The License Agreement is included in your game box, and 
	the Code of Conduct can be found on the following page:<br>

	3. Do not hold events within towns. You may call people to gather at 
	outposts, however.<br>

	We've had some major upsets among the peerage of Dereth. Our first rank 7 
	monarch, Kou Ichi Jin-Rai, released his major captains from service and 
	spent a period of rest and solitude in the hills. He has since returned to 
	civilization, and is seeking new recruits to the Ichi Kazoko allegiance. You 
	can find an update in the Allegiance Hall under the heading &quot;Interviews with 
	Top Monarchs.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Meanwhile, other nobles have rushed to emulate the Sho master's political 
	achievement. Soon after Ichi's abdication, a Gharu'ndim and Aluvian each 
	attained the 7th rank. Mushir Fizzle of the Eternal Conclave on Harvestgain 
	has reigned supreme for two weeks, and at latest report is up to 855 
	followers, just ahead of the fast-rising Duke Beobalf, whose allegiance on 
	Frostfell currently tops 810. Already the allegiance system has proven a 
	fabulous success. We receive links to new allegiance Web pages daily, and 
	players on every world now have a range of choices when looking to join a 
	powerful organization.<br>
	<br>
	As far as it's come, however, the allegiance system still has a lot of 
	untapped potential. Our list of top monarchs represents every world but 
	Darktide -- a savage frontier where every player has the power to harm every 
	other. On Darktide, mercenaries thrive on feuds between powerful 
	adventurers, and outlaws prey freely on the weak. Never has a land been in 
	such sore need of a wise and good king to dispense justice. Be assured that 
	if you manage to enforce peace on Darktide, we will honor your achievements 
	in the Annals!<br>

	If you haven't visited any of the fan sites in the Allegiance Hall or the 
	Related Links pages, you've missed a major element of the Asheron's Call 
	phenomenon. By browsing the links, you can find the perfect group of people 
	to adventure with, jokes and humorous anecdotes, player fiction, and even 
	software utilities to help you conduct magical research and get around in 
	the world.</span><span style="font-family: Arial; text-decoration: underline"><span class="head1" style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><br>

	comprehensive info on all Harvestgain allegiances, and of course best for 
	women playing on Harvestgain.<br>

	stress that in shipping Asheron's Call, we merely set the foundations on 
	which we'll continue to build. Our flexible content engine allows us not 
	only to create world-altering monthly events but also to evolve the overall 
	look and performance of the game. The features that are being praised today
