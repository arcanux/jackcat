		<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=347">Turbine Site</a> 
		- February 8, 2005</font></span><p><font face="Arial">Ah, much to 
		discuss this time around.&nbsp; Much news, as well as much that is new; this 
		is going to be a long one covering a wide range of subjects.&nbsp; We had 
		intended to post this a couple weeks ago, but several dates had to be 
		firmed up and confirmed with our partners; we wanted to be confident 
		talking about them.&nbsp; So, to paraphrase Bette Davis: &quot;Buckle up, boys; 
		it's going to be a <i>bumpy</i> ride.&quot;</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">About <i>Throne of Destiny</i>, I have good news 
		and I have bad news.&nbsp; The good news is: we have merged the two separate 
		development trees, the User Interface/Graphics Upgrade tree and the 
		Content and Game System tree, into one big honking tree and it works 
		pretty well.&nbsp; Well, for the most part.&nbsp; This merged the new UI code and 
		graphics engine work with the new quests and game systems and much of 
		the new art, so we could debug more effectively.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">It also gives us a chance to see just how the new 
		content and systems will react to all that new UI code and graphics 
		engine changes, which scared us a bunch every time we thought it.&nbsp; One 
		of the larger risks of this project, if not <i>the</i> largest, is the 
		sheer amount of old code we've had to touch to get an improvement in the 
		graphics display and make the user interface easier to deal with.&nbsp; In 
		the biz, we call this &quot;legacy code.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Some of the legacy code we're working with is 
		going on eight years old; that's enough to make any sane engineer mad as 
		a loon.&nbsp; As an example, imagine you are an engineer and someone gives 
		you the task of upgrading one of the top ten selling games from 1997, 
		such as <i>Dungeon Keeper</i> or <i>Diablo</i>,* &nbsp;but because you don't 
		have two years of development and six months of debugging to work with, 
		you have to keep most of the underlying code. You need to make sure it 
		works on today's machines, graphics cards and operating systems, which 
		have changed a number of times in those eight years, and that it has a 
		better graphics look to it, but you can't just toss is out and start 
		from scratch, which is what you'd normally do.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">And just to add to your joy, imagine some of the 
		previous developers who wrote some of this the code, people long gone 
		from the company, didn't provide frills such as documentation or 
		commenting the code, so that those who followed after would know what 
		those various bits of the code were supposed to do.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Can you imagine the conflicts you'd run into 
		trying to do that?&nbsp; That old legacy code is going to be an issue every 
		step of the way.&nbsp; It can be done; it just has its own set of unique 
		issues with which you have to deal and you never know when something you 
		didn't anticipate is going to rear up and bite you in the butt.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Which brings us to the bad news:&nbsp; We are running 
		into some of those legacy code issues and it is slowing us down.&nbsp; We 
		actually expected to be code complete by now and into nothing but bug 
		fixes; however, because of some of those legacy issues and the need to 
		get them scoped out and fixed <i>right now</i>, we're behind schedule.&nbsp; 
		That's going to affect our release date; more on that below.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">And because someone is certainly going to ask: 
		Yeah, we <i>did</i> plan a lot of extra slack time into the engineering 
		schedule long before we began coding, more than I've ever planned into a 
		project before; I'm talking about a full man-year of padding just for 
		legacy issues.&nbsp; We ended up being bit harder than we thought we would by 
		those issues.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">RETAIL DISTRIBUTION</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">First up, you've probably already heard about the 
		distribution agreement with Sony Online Entertainment's Station 
		Publishing.&nbsp; <i>Throne of Destiny</i> will be on the shelves of most, if 
		not all, of the major retailers, not just GameStop and EB. There will be 
		very strong retail support including pre-order boxes, posters, and even 
		shelf and counter displays at key locations. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">This is all to the good; it means wide 
		distribution of the game and, we fervently hope, bunches of new players 
		coming in the door for a look-see.&nbsp; To back up the launch, you'll also 
		be seeing advertising in major game magazines and online sites.&nbsp; All 
		this takes time to get in place; for example, advertising, box covers, 
		compositions of the boxes, manuals, et al, takes time to design and 
		approve, then to be duplicated and be ready to go for the gold master.&nbsp; 
		For another, the major mags need everything in place 60-90 days ahead of 
		the street date.&nbsp; All in all, though, this is coming together nicely.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">We also have a price cap: We expect the Suggested 
		Retail Price to be at or around $29.99.&nbsp; If the SRP is going to end up 
		much different than that, we'll let you know immediately.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">PRE-ORDERS</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">Right now, pre-orders of the retail package are 
		scheduled to be available about a month before ACTD launches.&nbsp; You'll be 
		able to pre-order at retail software stores and we're offering a couple 
		incentives for doing so.&nbsp; All those who pre-order <i>Throne of Destiny</i> 
		will receive both:</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font face="Arial">A new gem for each character when that 
			characters logs into the Expansion for the first time. This gem is 
			called Asheron's Benediction.&nbsp; It is an eternal, bonded and attuned 
			gem that provides a 10% increase in health for 24 hours.&nbsp; It may be 
			used as often as you wish. If you die, for example, you can reuse it 
			immediately.&nbsp; The effect does not stack; for example, if you use it 
			three times in a short period, you don't receive a 30% increase in 
			health, only the 10% increase.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial">Blackmoor's Favor, a gem that increases 
			Natural Armor by +50 for 24 hours.&nbsp; As with Asheron's Benediction, 
			this gem is eternal, bonded and attuned and is 24 hours per use and 
			may be reused immediately at any time.&nbsp; Again, the effect does not 
			stack.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial">These items will automatically be dropped into the 
		inventory of every character when they log in.&nbsp; If there is no inventory 
		slot available, the game will just hold onto it until the character logs 
		in with an open slot.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Since the gems are bonded and attuned, they won't 
		be tradable; they'll only be useful to the character they were given to 
		originally.&nbsp; Essentially, we're handing out perma-buffs, two of them if 
		you pre-order, one if you just buy the expansion when it hits the 
		shelves.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">TESTING: CLOSED PLAYER BETA COMING UP</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">We're ready to start inviting more people into the 
		testing.&nbsp; Beginning next week, we're going to start offering invitations 
		to some players to be involved in the first round of closed Beta player 
		testing.&nbsp; We've had plenty of requests to be involved and we thank you 
		for those; later on, we're going to throw open the doors to more people 
		for load testing.&nbsp; However, for the first round of player pounding, 
		we're going to stick with a core group of about 300.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">So, if you don't receive an invitation for this 
		first round, don't worry, you may get a chance to preview it later on.&nbsp; 
		There will be a pretty hefty download involved, around 400 MB; you've 
		been warned.&nbsp; You'll also need an active account on the Turbine Billing 
		system to be part of the test or preview.&nbsp; If you haven't yet migrated 
		your account and want to be involved with the test or preview, now is 
		the time, :D.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Right now, we're currently deep in internal 
		testing.&nbsp; On the front lines, we now have a larger dedicated team 
		assigned from QA exclusively to the <i>Throne of Destiny</i> project, 
		including a couple senior testers with years of MMO testing experience 
		that <s>we stole</s> made the move to Turbine from a competitor.&nbsp; We 
		also have large external teams standing by to do hardware/software 
		compatibility and performance testing on the CCC builds; the sheer 
		number of hardware configurations among personal computers boggles the 
		mind and we have to test as many as we can.&nbsp; For example, every test 
		that is performed on a computer running Win XP with an Nvidia card has 
		to be completely duplicated on a computer running Win98 with an Nvidia 
		card, and then on a PC running Win98 with an ATI card... you get the 
		picture.&nbsp; This takes literally thousands of hours.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">As you might imagine from the Development section 
		of this letter, we're spending quite a lot of time on graphics upgrade 
		and UI issues.&nbsp; Sometimes, the bugs we see can actually be pretty 
		funny.&nbsp; Check out the screenshot of a data bug from an older build.&nbsp; We 
		wanted to check that the building texture redraws from our art 
		outsourcer were lining up and degrading properly, so we put them in an 
		old ACDM tree for a quick look.&nbsp; The buildings ended up looking like 
		they were designed by crazed tuskers:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">
		<a target="_blank" href="../teaser/ToD1.htm">
		<img height="212" alt="" src="ToD/213.jpg" width="300" border="1"></a></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Thankfully, this was one of those bugs that can be 
		– and was – easily fixed, though it had us scared for a few minutes.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">HARDWARE</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">The test hardware for the player betas is being 
		set up and burned-in now.&nbsp; This will be a new world, matching the number 
		of servers and the software set-up of our current worlds, so we can get 
		an accurate measurement of how the server-side of this expansion is 
		working. &nbsp;Testers will be accessing it from the Turbine launcher with a 
		special build of the game.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">While this isn't directly related to the expansion 
		pack, I want to discuss hardware in general.&nbsp; As most of you know, when 
		we bought the game back from Microsoft, we inherited the old equipment 
		used to run the game – servers, routers, hard drive arrays, et al – as 
		part of the deal.&nbsp; Some of those servers are seven years old and are 
		starting to act funky; remember the SQL servers that died last year?&nbsp; 
		Some of these funky-acting game servers are bound to start failing soon; 
		hey, you'd keel over, too, if someone kept you working for seven years 
		straight without a break.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">We've been replacing hardware as it fails, but 
		we're going to accelerate that process a bit.&nbsp; We can't replace 
		everything all at once; my budget doesn't allow spending the millions 
		needed to do that.&nbsp; Our current short-term plan is to replace the seven 
		or eight machines that are showing signs of senility <i><u>and</u></i> 
		all the machines on two worlds with fresh hardware.&nbsp; Then we'll take the 
		old machines that still work adequately and distribute them among the 
		other worlds to A) help increase performance and B) act as a safety net 
		in case one or more machines on a world dies.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">After tossing out the senile machines, this should 
		result in at least two extra servers on every world still using the old 
		hardware and, in most cases, three of them.&nbsp; If we can recover the 
		senile machines without having to rebuild them (trying to find parts for 
		seven-year-old quad processor servers is about as easy as finding a 
		politician at an honesty contest), we'll add them in, too.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Our NetOps crew has much of the equipment in hand 
		and we're hoping to get this done before the expansion launches 
		(everyone send good vibes, please; those guys are so overworked that it 
		isn't even funny).&nbsp; When we do make the replacements, the two worlds 
		that are getting the fresh equipment will be down for most of a day 
		while we transfer the databases; we'll give you plenty of advance notice 
		on that.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Which worlds, you ask?&nbsp; This question scares me, 
		because everyone is going to want the fresh machines for their main 
		world and we can't please everyone. One world is an obvious choice: 
		Darktide.&nbsp; The nature of the combat on that world is such that it makes 
		sense to have it running on our best hardware, so Darktide will be 
		getting one of the makeovers.&nbsp; As for the second world: we'll look over 
		the logs and make a choice based on a number of metrics, including the 
		number of active accounts and overall use.&nbsp; If two or three worlds are 
		close on those metrics... I don't know, maybe we'll hold a raffle or 
		take bribes, :D.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial" size="3">AND WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW...</font></b></div>
		<p><font face="Arial">So, one might ask, just when will the expansion 
		pack ship?&nbsp; If you've read this far, then you know we're running behind 
		where we wanted to be and that player testing is starting late.&nbsp; And we 
		want to have a meaningful round of player tests, so that we can have 
		multiple iterations of the test/debug/retest process and catch 
		everything we can before the launch.&nbsp; It doesn't make much sense to do 
		that until we've run our own tests internally and with third party 
		compatibility and performance testers to fix the obvious bugs.&nbsp; On top 
		of that, we need to turn out the master duplication disc (the &quot;Gold 
		Master&quot; in game-dev jargon) at least one month earlier than the launch 
		date, so the game can be pressed onto discs, slipped into boxes and 
		trucked to the stores in time to hit the shelves.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">To make a ship by the end of March, which would be 
		in our original ship range of the first quarter, we would have to make 
		that Gold Master sometime in the next two weeks.&nbsp; Folks, we're just not 
		ready to do that.&nbsp; Based on that, we're pushing out our original ship 
		range of &quot;1st Quarter 2005&quot; to May.&nbsp; Our target date is May 11 and we're 
		basing all our testing, manufacturing, box distribution to retail, 
		marketing and PR schedules on it (as some GameStop customers know from 
		last Friday's posting at the GameStop web site).&nbsp; This is a six week 
		push from the end of the 1st quarter, but we think it is absolutely 
		critical that we have a chance to react to as much player feedback as we 
		can before we launch.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">So, please accept my apologies for the delay, but 
		I hope that you understand– and believe that you <i>do</i> understand – 
		the necessity of it.&nbsp; I think we'd all rather take the extra time than 
		ship too early.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The really tough news here – certainly the 
		toughest to talk about – is that the delay has other consequences.&nbsp; To 
		have a reasonable chance of fixing the bugs that come up in testing and 
		polishing the content based on tester comments, we need all hands 
		looking at and reacting to bugs and comments between now and the Gold 
		Master date in mid-April.&nbsp; On top of that, now that the development 
		trees are merged and all testing is being done in the environment we're 
		going to ship to retail, we can't complicate matters by adding more 
		non-expansion pack content to the development; we're pushed for testing 
		time as it is.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">So if you haven't guessed it already, the tough 
		news is this: For the first time in the five-plus year history of the 
		game, after 52 free monthly episodes that make up the equivalent of 
		eight or nine expansion packs you'd normally buy at retail, we're forced 
		to skip not just one, but two of them.&nbsp; That means there will be no 
		episodes for March or April.&nbsp; The expansion pack will launch in May with 
		new content for all character levels and we'll resume our normal episode 
		schedule in June.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Yeah, we don't like it any more than you do; we 
		love doing the monthly episodes and feel it is part of the game's charm 
		and appeal.&nbsp; We just don't see any other option if we're to ship the 
		expansion pack in May with a reasonable chance of not having it blow up 
		in our faces.&nbsp; To help pick up part of the slack, we're going to greatly 
		increase the number of live events on all worlds throughout February, 
		March and April, running multiple events during both the day and evening 
		hours and for all character levels.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">So there it is, all the news to date: the great 
		and the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp; I apologize again that we weren't 
		able to get all this out to you earlier, because some of it is truly 
		great news, like the hardware replacements and pre-order gems.&nbsp; I hope 
		you'll bear with us for that lapse and have patience with us as we 
		prepare to ship this truly humongous effort of an expansion pack to the 
		stores.</font></p>
