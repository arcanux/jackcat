    </font>
      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">He moved quickly. It was necessary; he would soon be missed, and he could 
    not bear the strain that it would put on his mother. He decided to go after 
    the start of Alba'rel's cycle, slipping through the portal under an assault 
    of acidic clouds and frosty air. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron had not yet stirred, and every day 
    the color drained out of his face a little more. Borelean's mother dressed 
    the wound every few hours, yet each new dressing revealed that the old one 
    was horribly stained. The wound simply would not knit. When his mother 
    slept, Borelean had tried to heal Asheron's wound using what little life 
    magic he had been taught. It was to no avail. Asheron was dying, and Dereth 
    with him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rithwic was silent, save for the peddlers who 
    mostly wept and wondered when Gaerlan's forces would return. Worse, they 
    pondered where this Harbinger would rise, what it was, and how they would 
    stand against it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gaerlan had proven to be unstoppable. His 
    armies had swept across Osteth into the civilized towns and laid siege 
    without effort. Now they held nearly every city across Dereth in an 
    ever-tightening grasp. For every elemental that fell to the blades of the 
    Isparians, another would rise, followed by its brethren. Gaerlan had proven 
    that he was immune to the barriers Nuhmudira had created to shield the 
    Isparians from the Empyrean, so even the sanctity and safety of being within 
    one's home had become unsure. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In mansions maintained by the richest and 
    most powerful nobles, panicked voices rose to question Gaerlan's intent. “Is 
    he bringing back the Hopeslayer?”“Is it Bael'Zharon?”“The master Lady 
    Aerfalle speaks of?” All these questions and so few answers. In a time 
    before, his mother had stood by the side of many of these men and women and 
    brought down a Shadow Spire outside Cragstone. Those days were now 
    forgotten. Some muttered now that High Queen Elysa Strathelar was a corrupt 
    noble who had secured her position through her friendship with Asheron. 
    Regicide was never far from their minds. Borelean was young, but he was 
    quickly losing his innocence about the world and the people who would one 
    day be his subjects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During his mother's council meetings, he had 
    listened to the councilors and watched the proceedings through a crack in 
    the door. He knew that his mother was the strongest-willed person on this 
    world, and though at times she was overprotective of him, her first duty was 
    the safety of her people. Now, however, she knew that they faced a foe 
    against whom they had no hope--none without Asheron. The Isparians truly 
    were fledglings on this world. The magic at Gaerlan and Asheron's command 
    was advanced far beyond anything any of them understood. That is, any except 
    Martine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Borelean remembered when Bael'Zharon had 
    first come to Dereth, how his mother had warned him that she was going to 
    face grave danger and that he needed to be brave for her. He had not 
    understood what she'd meant, until now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He passed the beleaguered Lugian Emissary 
    speaking to a passer-by. “Have you heard anything about Linvak Tukal? Timaru?” 
    the gray giant asked in a deep gruff voice. The passer-by shook her head and 
    moved on into the night. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Borelean stopped and looked at the Lugian as 
    the first drop of rain fell from the sky. “Linvak Tukal? Are you worried 
    that your home is in danger too?” he asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The gray giant kneeled to speak to him. “Of 
    course I am, little boy. Whoever this man is, he will not stop with your 
    race. He does not mean to stop with any of us. He will fight until we are 
    all gone.” The Lugian managed a smile and stood upright once more. Borelean 
    gazed up at the hulking mass of the Lugian for a long moment, then sprinted 
    toward the portal as the rain intensified. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The tunnels were easy to navigate. He wasn't 
    the only child among those who milled within, so he easily made his way 
    through the crowd without being noticed. He followed the passage upward and 
    looked in on the throne room where Martine sat. Creeping silently across the 
    floor and past the two slumbering forms outside, he pulled himself through a 
    window and looked at the man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Why did you try to kill Uncle Asheron?” he 
    asked without fear. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The man's head, devoid of skin, twisted 
    unnaturally as the masked face seemed to regard him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“He's not dead. Not yet. You can make things 
    right.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Borelean's words were met with silence.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It is not possible!” Gaerlan fumed. “I 
    followed the rituals perfectly as they were laid out in the book! How could 
    she have been freed? There is no way. . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">His ice blue eyes looked out over the 
    horizon. Below him, off at a great distance, he could see the Crater Lake. 
    “Vermin! Freeing a murderer, a seeker of Falatacot ways! A Blood Witch! You 
    are not worthy!” He gripped the hilt at his waist and let out a low growl. 
    “Soon Iasparailaun, soon.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He tapped the hilt and turned toward the 
    tower. Wind rushed over the edge of the battlements and coalesced into a 
    tangible being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“Master. We are prepared.”</i>The voice 
    slipped into his mind. Concentrating for a long moment, he saw what his army 
    saw. Each stood ready for the final assault. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although he still commanded the forces of the 
    elements, the Harbinger could not be summoned without a physical form to 
    contain its power. Undoubtedly the small minds of these Isparians were 
    oblivious to his failing, and the occupation of Osteth would crush their 
    wills and secure his victory. Nevertheless, he needed to act quickly. The 
    vermin must not be given any chance to take advantage of this setback. One 
    example had already been made, and as long as the wreckage smoldered, etched 
    in their memory, he had an advantage over the Isparians. Still, the 
    Harbinger was coming. Unless he stopped it, it would consume everything.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He still had time. Not much, but enough.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Lugians delivered the armor to us as 
    promised. But when the storehouses were raided, we lost every last piece. We 
    have had very little luck ascertaining the whereabouts of anything that was 
    taken.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra paused and looked across the room, 
    then swallowed hard before she continued. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We also lost the amulets, all of them. We 
    sent citizens to collect them, but all that have been retrieved are ruined. 
    High Queen Elysa has been more than helpful, her Royal Guard have assisted 
    us at every turn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Asheron came to us a few months ago. . .” 
    Ciandra stopped short as her guest lifted a quizzical brow, a lattice of 
    wrinkles joining together in a spider web across her forehead. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra cleared her throat, then continued. 
    “His assistance proved invaluable in much of our research. We have created a 
    new kind of device, as instructed, that will allow weapons and wands to bite 
    deeper against a chosen entity. Thus far we have only succeeded in altering 
    the focus to deal with the elemental menace, but we continue our research to 
    increase the spectrum of creatures that such items will affect.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her guest reached forward and collected a 
    ceramic mug from the table. Carefully, Ciandra lifted the teapot and filled 
    the mug. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We have also made great strides in tinkering 
    as well. Everything has continued to fall into place.” Ciandra paused. “Nuhmudira?”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her guest sipped the tea gently. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“How did you escape?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“There are more important things to attend to 
    than the how of my escape.” Nuhmudira smiled, and placed the mug on the 
    table with a gentle clink. “Please tell me more. . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra obliged as the night slowly gave way 
    to the dawn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius drank from his waterskin. Timaru was 
    fast becoming a second home to him, though Lytelthorpe was only a few portal 
    trips away. He had been upon Marae Lassel since the High Queen had asked 
    that he watch the comings and goings from Martine's Holding some months 
    before, and he had come to appreciate the free spirit of Timaru. He stayed 
    with the Aun Tumeroks from time to time and listened to the wisdom imparted 
    by Aun Hareltah. He had found them to be an intricate people with a rich 
    heritage far more in tune with the spirits of the world than the Isparians'.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">News of recent events on Dereth had reached 
    Aun Hareltah and had disturbed the quiet of the Timaru Xuta. The disquiet 
    was grave enough to call the Shamans from their drumming circles. As Antius 
    watched the discussion being held in the lodge, he wondered what could 
    possibly be so important as to call them from the Menhir Rings. After a few 
    hours, Hareltah emerged from the tent and walked in a slow gait toward 
    Antius. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Spirits within the world weep, but their 
    tears are drying quickly,” Aun Hareltah said. A look of concern passed over 
    the elder's face. “Our duty is to protect Palenqual from Wharu, Ispar 
    Antiusnua, yet the spirits of the land have spoken to us. You will be needed 
    soon by your Xuta. There is a great force coming, one that will lead to the 
    eradication of all that lives and dies. Even Wharu's children cannot face 
    down this thing.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius looked at the Elder quizzically, then 
    nodded. Magic had fluctuated and not for the better. Everything had changed 
    in the wink of an eye, and though it was possible to adapt, it was 
    nevertheless something that had not been expected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Before your people came among us, one like 
    you, but touched by Atua Ngamaru, spoke of a powerful Pale One who had not 
    left with the others. He called that one Asheron. You must seek him. He is 
    needed for this world to survive.” The Elder placed his hand upon Antius' 
    shoulder and bowed his head gently. Antius repeated the gesture, pondering 
    what Hareltah had said. As the Elder turned back to the tent, Antius 
    withdrew a sapphire orb from his pouch and muttered the words that would 
    take him to High Queen Elysa's castle. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He arrived to find the castle in utter ruin.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The same happened in Yanshi.” A voice called 
    behind him. A man in the yellow and red robes of the royal guard stood at 
    attention, looking at him as though he knew him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius Blackmoor, yes?” Antius nodded. “The 
    High Queen has a new request of you. Please follow me.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The fever tugged at him again. Elysa pressed 
    the cloth against his burning brow and spoke to him as she had for nearly 
    two months now. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Do you remember when you told me that you 
    had made a difficult decision, Asheron?” She smiled as she dipped the cloth 
    into the basin. “I know what you meant, and I'll be damned if you made that 
    choice just to leave us. So you need to fight. We need you. Gaerlan is 
    growing stronger by the day.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A tiny voice sounded from behind her, 
    distant, almost unreal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Mother. . .” She turned and saw Borelean.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In one fluid motion, her left hand grasped 
    the bow as her right hand slipped an arrow from beneath Asheron's bed. She 
    had nocked and aimed the arrow by the time she was standing. Her eyes were 
    fixed on the eyeholes of the mask of the man standing behind her son. 
    Beneath them, she could see a glint of white, of something not quite human, 
    not quite Virindi. A chill ran down her spine. It was Martine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hello, Elysa.”</font></p>

    <br>
    An uneasy peace had settled over the town since the final defeat of the 
    Elemental Generals and the appearance of the portal to Gaerlan's Sanctum. 
    Accounts from those daring enough to enter said the halls of the sanctum 
    echoed with incantations. Strangely, although these brave souls said they 
    heard the words of the spells in another language, the words' meanings 
    appeared in their minds. Gaerlan seemed to be calling the elemental forces 
    together into one form. Considering his contempt for Derethians, all knew 
    this didn't bode well for them. However, Gaerlan's efforts seemed to have 
    been stymied by the loss of his “vessel,” the missing Nuhmudira that he had 
    been planning to use to contain the Elemental force. It was hoped that this 
    obstacle would prevent Gaerlan from completing his work. In spite of that, 
    it appeared now that he had pushed forward, with cataclysmic results for 
    Yanshi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It began with an earth-shattering explosion 
    violently shaking the people of Yanshi from their beds. Pure mana exploded 
    up from the earth below Yanshi, igniting the buildings of the town and 
    sending the residents fleeing. Those that couldn't escape were killed in the 
    explosions, but the Lifestones resurrected all--save one. The Jeweler Xao Wu 
    never appeared. The survivors were stunned, for only a few had truly died a 
    violent death since Asheron had perfected the Lifestones. The question was 
    muttered among them: had Gaerlan found a means of breaking their connection 
    to the Lifestones? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet the desperate times have brought boons to 
    mages and warrior alike. The Arcanum's continued research into Empyrean 
    transmutation techniques has resulted in new abilities for Tinkers. Now that 
    they can imbue weapons and wands with abilities unseen before, Tinkers know 
    they will be getting little sleep in the days to come. At the same time, the 
    world's magical fields continue to shift, giving war mages new spells and 
    increased power. After suffering from the effects of Gaerlan's tampering for 
    months, these new abilities are a welcome change. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Along with all of this, tales are being told 
    though that Martine has shaken off his stupor, and that the people of Dereth, 
    coupled with the visit of young Prince Borelean, were responsible for 
    helping him. As fantastic as these tales sound, more surprising events have 
    happened. All that the people of Dereth can do is prepare themselves for the 
    battles that are sure to come. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Following is a list of the most 
    interesting additions made to the game with this update. However, please 
    note that not everything has been included--that would spoil the fun of

    <p><span class="Head"><b>New Functionality and Content </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gaerlan's elemental magic has changed the 
      face of Osteth. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">War Magic spells now benefit from a 
      skill-based damage bonus. The amount of the bonus to the damage inflicted 
      by the spell is based upon the level of the spell and the buffed skill of 
      the spell caster. Please see this month's
      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0802.asp">
      Letter to the Players</a> for the full details on this new system. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the new damage bonus for 
      War Magic, all mages have a chance of causing additional damage through a 
      “critical strike.” In some respects, a critical strike is similar to melee 
      critical hits, although the dynamic is very different. Our
      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0802.asp">
      Letter to the Players</a> explains this new system. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new class of war spells, called arcs, 
      has been added. These spells arc similar to arrows and do not “track” like 
      other spells. This means the spell will land where the target was standing 
      when the spell was launched, not an estimation of where the target should 
      be if the target was moving. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Slayer quality has been added to the 
      Isparian wands. This quality will increase the damage of all projectile 
      spells cast on the creature type for which the wand is a “slayer.” For 
      example, spells that are cast while wielding a Smoldering Isparian Wand 
      will inflict additional damage to Frost Elementals. This quality will not 
      increase the effect of any spell that is not a projectile, ring, wall, or 
      arc. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new style of armor is now appearing as 
      loot. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Both Hollow and Deadly Hollow weapons have 
      been modified to do more damage. In addition, Deadly Hollow versions of 
      Daggers, Nabuts and Katars can now be created. Players will also now be 
      able to craft “Phantom” weapons. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Player Killers will find that recalling 
      and logging out takes a bit longer. A Player Killer character now takes an 
      additional twenty seconds to log out, while Portal Sending spells, such as 
      those cast by the Shendolain Gem or the Aerlinthe Recall spell, delay for 
      two seconds before taking effect. This does not affect characters that are 
      not Player Killers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Magic Item Tinkering effects make their 
      appearance this month! There are three new effects that Magic Item Tinkers 
      can add. For a full explanation, see

      August's Letter to the Players</a>. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have a new piece of armor to complement 
      greaves. You should be finding tassets, armor that covers the upper leg, 
      as loot on creatures. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are 500 new Residential Quarters 
      available for purchase. </font></li>

    <p><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements and Changes </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new wield requirement level has been 
      added for melee weapons to provide an intermediate goal between the two 
      existing requirement levels. We've also modified the wield requirements on 
      the higher damage missile weapons to bring them more in line with melee 
      weapons. These changes are fully explained in the
      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0802.asp">
      Letter to the Players</a>. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The individual protection multipliers 
      provided by armor are now capped at 2.0. Previously, these protection 
      multipliers could be raised above 2.0 through Item Magic Bane spells.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The descriptions of clothing and armor 
      have been changed to reflect what areas they protect, not what areas they 
      appear to cover. The
      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0802.asp">
      Letter to the Players</a> has more details on this change. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to the way vendors handled salvaged 
      materials, selling salvaged materials was not working as we had intended. 
      Only materials without an effect associated with them could be sold. This 
      has been changed so that now, all blacksmiths, weaponsmiths, armorers, 
      shopkeepers, and provisioners should purchase all types of salvaged 
      materials. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The drop rates for some materials from 
      higher-level loot sources have been slightly altered. Gold shouldn't be as 
      prevalent as it once was, while Mahogany, Oak and Pine should be slightly 
      more prevalent than they were before. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If a character's quest timer has not 
      expired and they are prevented from picking up an item, they will receive 
      a message explaining how long it is before they can pick up that item 
      again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The changes made to the sort order of 
      items sold by vendors inadvertently changed the order in which creatures 
      would wield their weapons. This caused creatures such as Lugians to wield 
      melee weapons over missile weapons. This has been corrected and you should 
      now be dodging rocks once again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The quest spells from the Gredaline 
      Consulate and those cast by the Lugian gems have had their duration 
      increased to match the level of the spell they most closely represent.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spell book filters now persist between 
      logins and are specific to each character. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The mana cost for levels 1 through 5 Life 
      Magic Drains has been reduced. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to a long-outstanding bug, translucent 
      objects, such as some creatures or quest items, occasionally lost their 
      transparency. This has been corrected and these objects should no longer 
      loose their translucent quality. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The number of Eviscerators and Legionaries 
      dropping the quest pincers has been increased. You will now find three 
      Eviscerators that drop pincers in the “Lair of the Eviscerators” and two 
      Legionaries dropping pincers in the “Ancient Empyrean Grotto.” </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The difficulty level for creating Perfect 
      Infused Pyreal Ingots has been lowered. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In adding the new armor for this patch, we 
      discovered that Koujia Sleeves, Amuli Leggings and Steel-Toed Boots were 
      infrequently appearing in higher quality loot sources. They have been 
      modified so that they should now be appearing more frequently in 
      higher-level loot sources. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We fixed a bug that would crash your 
      client when you tried to set your client's font to one with a name longer 
      than thirty-two characters and that did not exist on your system. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The examination panel has been slightly 
      tweaked. Special properties on items, such as the Slayer quality, now 
      display in a specific area. Also, since the Attack Bonus modifier provides 
      no benefit to missile weapons, this information will no longer display 
      when missile weapons are examined. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Kira Sojini and Guard Tsaya have had their 
      gender issues resolved. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wedding Planners are now wearing dresses. 
      Previously they had been wearing a shirt and boots, but lacking pants. 
      (Resisting the temptation to make a snide comment. . .) </font></li>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">August 15, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">August is another exciting month for players 
    of <i>Asheron's Call</i>! Here is a summary of the changes and additions for 
    August. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Armor Changes </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <b>Covenant Armor: </b>This month marks the appearance of a new style of 
    armor for players. In addition to being visually appealing, this armor is 
    quite powerful, with protection values far beyond that of currently existing 
    armor. However, this increased power prevents the armor from being tinkered, 
    dyed, or even enchanted! Players looking for a suit of Covenant Armor will 
    find it as treasure from higher-level treasure sources. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Tassets: </b>We've had a breakthrough in 
    armor technology. Players will now find upper leg armor, called tassets, as 
    treasure at all levels of play. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Armor Coloring: </b>Both the tassets and 
      the Covenant Armor have unique abilities to allow players to customize 
      their appearance. The Covenant Armor pieces have the ability to take on 
      the color of the character's shirt and pants and use those colors as 
      highlights. Players will be able to change the appearance of their armor 
      simply by changing or dyeing their underlying clothing. Tassets also have 
      the ability to take on another color, but in this case, they take on the 
      color of the character's greaves. However, there is a restriction on this: 
      the tassets only take on the color of the greaves if the tassets and the 
      greaves are of the same type. If both pieces are metal, the tassets will 
      take on the color of the greaves. The same is true if both pieces are 
      leather, yet if the pieces are of different types, with one being metal 
      and the other leather, the tassets will not take on the color of the 
      greaves.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Areas Protected by Clothing and Armor:
      </b>A long-standing issue in <i>Asheron's Call </i>has caused some 
      confusion about what areas of the body are protected by various pieces of 
      clothing and armor. When examining a piece of clothing or armor, a line of 
      text detailing this item would appear in the examination panel. However, 
      instead of stating what areas of the body this item <i>protected</i>, this 
      was only a list of the areas of the character's body the item <i>covered</i>. 
      For example, when examining a pair of boots, the examination panel would 
      display that they covered the feet and lower legs. In reality however, the 
      boots only provided damage protection for the character's feet. We have 
      modified the examination panel for all pieces of armor and clothing so 
      that it accurately displays the areas of the body these items protect.

      The Item Magic Bane spells modify these protection modifiers by increasing 
      the multiplier and making the armor more resistant to that form of damage. 
      In the past, these spells could increase the protection modifiers on some 
      items far beyond the originally intended limit of 2.0. To address this, 
      we've instituted a 2.0 cap on the protection modifiers. Any item that 
      naturally or through spells had its protection modifier increased over 2.0 
      will now treat this modifier as though it had a 2.0 modifier. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Example: </b>A piece of armor has a 1.3 
    protection (Above Average) against fire damage. Previously, casting Flame 
    Bane 6 on this item would raise its protection to 2.8. Casting this spell 
    now will only raise the protection to 2.0. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Enhancements for Player Killers </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <b>Timers: </b>In the past, many Player Killers have complained that a 
    character in danger could escape an attack by logging off or using one of 
    the “Portal Sending” spells. To address these issues, we've added two new 
    features that effect Player Killer characters only. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first feature is a new log off timer. 
    Player Killer characters now take an additional 20 seconds to log off. 
    During these 20 seconds the character is unable to move, chat, or otherwise 
    interact with the game. After 20 seconds the normal log off animation will 
    be played. It should be noted that any time a character is logging off, PK 
    or not, all physical attacks against them become automatically critical. 
    (Note that spells do not share this behavior.) We hope this will stress the 
    need to log off in a safe place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second feature is a new timer added to 
    the “Portal Sending” spells. Portal Sending spells (such as “Aerlinthe 
    Recall” and “Recall the Sanctuary”) and the spells cast by quest gems (such 
    as Shendolain Portal Gem), now delay by 2 seconds before transporting the 
    character. This 2-second delay is the normal delay seen in other portal 
    recall spells. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please note that these timer changes <b>only
    </b>affect Player Killer characters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hollow Weapons: </b>In the August event, 
    we've made some revisions to Hollow Weapons to make them more effective and 
    provide players with more options in PK combat. To make these weapons more 
    effective, the maximum damage for all Hollow and Deadly Hollow weapons has 
    been increased. In addition, players will now be able to craft Deadly Hollow 
    versions of all Hollow racial weapons. Another revision provides a new 
    version of the Ravenous weapons, called Phantom weapons. The damage dealt 
    out by these Phantom weapons ignores all armor values on a target. This 
    includes the armor values provided by armor worn on the target as well as 
    armor spells cast on the target. The only factors that reduce the Phantom 
    weapon's damage are either the target's Natural Resistances or Life 
    Protection spells. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although we had hoped to provide Hollow and 
    Phantom missile weapons for this event, we lacked the time to properly 
    implement them. However, they will be available in a future event. </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Wield Requirement Changes </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Last month saw the addition of high-damage melee weapons with a 325 weapon 
    skill wield requirement. After some thought, we determined that an 
    additional level of skill-restricted weapon between the 250 requirement and 
    the 325 requirement would be beneficial. That being the case, we have 
    modified the treasure system to generate some melee weapons with a 300 
    requirement. Although these weapons will not have the maximum damage 
    possible for that weapon type, these weapons would have come with a 325 
    requirement last month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, we have added two new levels of wield 
    requirements for missile weapons and adjusted the existing level of wield 
    requirements to be more equivalent--in terms of invested experience--with 
    the melee requirements. Missile weapons can now spawn with weapon skill 
    requirements of 250, 270, or 290, depending upon their damage modifier.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that these changes only affect new 
    weapons generated this month. Existing weapons will not be changed at all.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>War Magic Changes </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <b>Skill Based Damage Bonus: </b>As we previously announced, this month War 
    Mages will begin seeing bonuses on the amount of damage their war spells 
    inflict. This bonus is a percentage damage bonus on top of the normal war 
    spell damage. This additional damage will be a constant percentage of the 
    minimum damage value. The percentage is determined by comparing the level of 
    the spell against the buffed war magic skill of the character. As the level 
    of the spell increases, so does the potential for increased damage, although 
    these higher percentages require more skill. Note that creatures do not 
    receive this bonus. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Critical Strikes: </b>In addition to the 
    skill-based damage bonus, each projectile spell has a 2% chance of causing a 
    critical hit on the target and doing increased damage. A magical critical 
    hit is similar in some respects to melee critical hits (although the damage 
    calculation is handled differently). While a melee critical hit 
    automatically does twice the maximum damage of the weapon, a magical 
    critical hit will do an additional half the minimum damage of the spell. For 
    instance, a magical critical hit from a level 7 spell, which does 110-180 
    points of damage, would add an additional 55 points of damage to the spell.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Arc Spells: </b>August also sees the 
    addition of a new type of projectile spell, the Arc. While most projectile 
    spells fly straight at their target, these spells arc similar to an arrow. 
    They also differ from projectiles in the fact that they do not “track” like 
    other spells. While a typical bolt spell will estimate where the target 
    should be and aim for that location, an Arc spell will land where the target 
    was when the spell was launched. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Slayer Wands: </b>Projectile spells also 
    now benefit from the “slayer” quality that first appeared on melee and 
    missile weapons. While wielding slayer wands, players will see an increase 
    in the damage dealt by projectile spells to the creatures that match the 
    slayer type of each wand. Other effects of other types of spells, such as 
    life magic transfers and harms, creature ineptitudes, or item enchantments, 
    are not enhanced by this quality. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Magic Item Tinkering </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The first three Magic Item Tinkering effects make their appearance this 
    month. These effects are completely unique and add properties to items never 
    before seen in <i>Asheron's Call</i>. Unlike other Tinkering effects, these 
    effects can only be applied to a weapon once, and an item can only have one 
    effect at a time. Due to these differences, these effects could more 
    properly be labeled “Weapon Imbuing.” In the future, more standard Tinkering 
    effects (i.e., those that can be applied more than once) may be available 
    for Magic Item Tinkering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Imbuing a Weapon: </b>Imbuing a weapon 
    with a new property involves many of the same steps as other Tinkering 
    operations. As with other operations, one hundred units of a material have 
    to be salvaged before the material can be used to imbue a weapon. The 
    difficulty of the operation is also based on the same factors as other 
    Tinkering operations. This means that the quality of the salvaged material, 
    the quality of the target item, and the Magic Item Tinkering skill of the 
    character all still affect the difficulty of the operation. It should be 
    noted that imbuing is more difficult than other Tinkering operations, and in 
    this tricky process the chance of success is never great. The other 
    restrictions also still apply, so an imbued sword or dagger cannot be 
    hilted, and these imbuing operations count against the total number of 
    tinkering operations that can be performed on an item. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Effects: </b>The following three effects 
    are available in August: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>--Critical Strike: </b>Applying this 
    effect to a weapon or wand increases the chance of inflicting a critical hit 
    when wielding this item. The percentage of increase is determined by the 
    base skill of the character wielding the item. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>--Crippling Blow: </b>This effect 
    increases the amount of damage a weapon or wand does when it causes a 
    critical hit. Again the higher your base skill, the more damage you will do 
    when causing a critical hit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>--Armor Rending: </b>The final Magic Item 
    Tinkering effect allows a weapon to ignore a portion of the target's total 
    armor, including the value added by a shield. The effect is similar to the 
    effect of Phantom weapons. The percentage of armor the weapon ignores is 
    based upon the base skill of the character. This effect is not available for 
    wands because war magic already ignores physical armor and armor spells.
    </font></p>

    <span lang="en-us">The Defense of the Cisterns - </span></b></font><font face="Arial"><small>From 
    the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEevent0902.asp">Zone</a></small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">September 17</span>, 
      2002</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the night of September 16th, 2002, the <i>
    AC </i>Team suited up specially created characters for a series of Live Ops 
    on the worlds of Thistledown, Harvestgain and Darktide. In laying out the 
    August Event, we included an element that would allow players to mount a 
    defense of the final Lightning Cistern Core. The Shard of the Herald defense 
    organized by players back in the November, 2000 event is something that 
    people in the community and on the <i>AC </i>Team look back to fondly. 
    However this time we decided to add a different element than was seen in the 
    Shard defense. Instead of the obvious choice seen in the Shard 
    defense--releasing Bael'Zharon is never a good thing--the choice in the 
    August Event was more ambiguous. Would you choose the devil you knew, 
    Gaerlan, or the devil you didn't, the Harbinger? Would you trust High Queen 
    Elysa's leadership and destroy the crystal, or resist her? We were unsure 
    exactly how the community would respond, but it was a feature we wanted to 
    add to the event and planned for it accordingly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In monitoring the various discussion boards 
    after the community learned of the upcoming PK element, we saw people taking 
    sides and forming factions almost immediately. Over the weekend we checked 
    in on the progress of the various worlds, and were impressed with the 
    dedication and the abilities of the players, whether they were attacking or 
    defending. We were particularly impressed with a group of players on 
    Darktide who spent seven hours destroying the low level crystal! On the 
    majority of the worlds the attackers banded together and broke through 
    whatever lines the defenders placed and destroyed the crystals. However on 
    the worlds Thistledown, Harvestgain and Darktide, the crystals stood. Seeing 
    this, we decided to implement the series of Live Ops we had sketched out.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>The Queen Onslaught </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Two hours before the Live Ops, the Queen made the following proclamation:
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Those that mean to keep the final cistern 
    core intact stand with Gaerlan. They stand against Dereth, and they stand 
    against their race. As High Queen it is my duty to defend and stand for and 
    with the people of Dereth. You have two hours. Then, if you continue this 
    folly I will bring my might to bear against you.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>I implore you to reconsider your actions. 
    We have worked too hard to fail now. Gaerlan must be stopped and the defeat 
    of these crystals is the only way to breach his Citadel's defense. Stand 
    with your fellows. . . or face my wrath.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those on the <i>AC </i>Team participating in 
    the event then began the process of creating and equipping the characters 
    they would need. The Queen's team consisted of: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">High Queen Elysa Strathelar </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Candeth Martine </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Kresovus, Leader of the Lugians of 
      Linvak Tukal </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aun Hareltah, Chieftain of the Aun Tumerok 
      Tribe </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Royal Guard Allyson </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Royal Guard Bahb </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Royal Guard Shara </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Royal Guard Kystra </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Royal Guard Xao </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gaerlan would also be making an appearance, 
    gloating and killing those who attacked his final crystal core. One choice 
    the team made for these Ops was to create characters that could be killed. 
    We wanted this to be a fair fight. . . or as fair as a fight of 9 versus 60 
    could be. Still it would not be god-like characters deciding the fate of the 
    world. We also established one rule for the Live Ops: if Queen Elysa were to 
    be killed in the final Crystal room, we would declare that the defenders had 
    held the line and conclude the Live Op. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first world visited by the team was 
    Thistledown, famous for its defense of the Shard of the Herald. Here we 
    found ourselves facing an enormous number of defenders and had great 
    difficulty even entering the dungeon. Eventually the team made its way to 
    the final room and began the attack on the Crystal. However, the defense 
    mounted finally overcame the Queen, and Martine parted the scene with the 
    final words, “Very well, you have made your choice. I will do this on my 
    own.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After licking our wounds, we visited the 
    world of Harvestgain. We found more equal numbers of defenders and attackers 
    on Harvestgain, and progressed to the final crystal room much more quickly. 
    Slowly the attackers, Royal Guard, and Elysa began chipping away at the 
    Crystal, when suddenly the Queen fell, to our surprise. Later review of what 
    happened revealed that two or three players, who had been attacking the 
    Crystal, turned on the Queen, firing two Hecatomb bolts at her, almost 
    completely draining her of life. A few melee attacks and the Queen was dead. 
    After the Queen fell, Martine parted the scene again with the same final 
    words. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final world visited was Darktide. Many of 
    the Crystals had been left standing on Darktide, and the Queen's called all 
    who would to assault these crystals and destroy them. We found that many of 
    those who responded role-played well, and we were glad to have them at our 
    side as we destroyed the various crystals. The portal to the final Crystal 
    opened and the Queen and the attackers made their way to the crystal to 
    begin the assault. A few Royal Guards remained behind to try and prevent 
    defenders from entering. These Guards held the line, and the Queen and her 
    people finally destroyed the Crystal. Gaerlan, who had been battling Martine 
    in the Crystal room prior to this, left with a final sneer to the defenders, 
    “You weak Isparians! You cannot do even the SIMPLEST thing!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the last Live Op concluded, the team 
    began to again review player reactions, both in-game and on the discussion 
    boards. We do want to apologize to anyone who was trying to aid in the 
    attack on the Crystal and was killed by the Queen or members of her party. 
    Sometimes in the heat of battle, minds can be clouded by bloodlust. If you 
    were killed by Gaerlan and were defending the crystal, well, just remember 
    Gaerlan's opinion of Isparians! </font></p>

	An uneasy peace had settled over the town since the final defeat of the 
	Elemental Generals and the appearance of the portal to Gaerlan's Sanctum.&nbsp; 
	Accounts from those daring enough to enter said the halls of the sanctum 
	echoed with incantations. Strangely, although these brave souls said they 
	heard the words of the spells in another language, the words' meanings 
	appeared in their minds. Gaerlan seemed to be calling the elemental forces 
	together into one form. Considering his contempt for Derethians, all knew 
	this didn't bode well for them. However, Gaerlan's efforts seemed to have 
	been stymied by the loss of his &quot;vessel,&quot; the missing Nuhmudira that he had 
	been planning to use to contain the Elemental force. It was hoped that this 
	obstacle would prevent Gaerlan from completing his work. In spite of that, 
	it appeared now that he had pushed forward, with cataclysmic results for 
	Yanshi.</p>

    <a name="les"></a>Interview with Turbine's Les Nelken - </span></b></font><font face="Arial"><small>From 
    the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEinterview0802.asp">Zone</a></small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">August</span>, 
      2002</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the June 2002 event, <i>Castling</i>, 
    players were introduced to the Arcane Pedestal and the “Precarious Sojourn” 
    floating dungeon. The designer, Les Nelken, took time to answer a few 
    questions about that particular quest and content design in general. </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How did it all get started? Did you go into the 
    quest to provide a specific reward to the players? Or did you have a 
    specific experience you wanted to give the players? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The rewards were what started it--the Dereth Map and the Arcane Pedestal had 
    been created during the production phase of the <i>Dark Majesty </i>
    Expansion Pack. We decided that we wanted to make these items available in 
    June. How that happened was entirely up to me. The Arcane Pedestal had been 
    created with no lore in mind; it was just a cool decoration. Designing 
    quests driven by existing reward items was not totally new territory for 
    me--quests I'd done over the two previous months, such as Thorsten's Armor 
    and the Horn of Vigilance, all started as items that had been previously 
    created. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With this item in hand, the main experience I 
    wanted to give players was the “Precarious Sojourn” floating dungeon. </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What was your inspiration for a floating dungeon?
    </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The concept of a floating dungeon was a dynamic I had in the back of my mind 
    for some time. Underground dungeons are great, but I wanted to create a new 
    experience for players, something different. Also, while <i>Asheron's Call
    </i>is a 3D game, there are few opportunities for players to battle monsters 
    in a fully three-dimensional setting, one that uses the “Z” axis. I came up 
    with all sorts of technical and game-play reasons why the dungeon wouldn't 
    work, but figured out ways around them, and went ahead and did it. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To start with, I did a concept sketch of the 
    structure and its components. I gave this list to Sean Huxter [Lead Artist 
    for <i>AC</i>], who did his usual fantastic job and created the art assets 
    necessary to build the dungeon. Because the formats of the platforms are the 
    same as those used for buildings, this is the largest outdoor structure on 
    Dereth. As part of the experience--like you might see in a movie--I wanted 
    players to arrive at the dungeon, but not see the full extent of it. As they 
    go around a corner, a vista would open up and they would get to see the rest 
    of the structure, with the endgame tower floating off in the distance. And 
    if the time of day was just right, they would see the sun rising behind it.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I spent some time trying to find the proper 
    location in Dereth for this structure. Eventually I found an appropriately 
    shaped canyon, although it wasn't completely perfect. I had to modify a 
    cliff so that it blocked the view of the rest of the dungeon when you first 
    arrived. I also modified the canyon so that if you are really good at 
    jumping, you can jump onto a platform from the cliff. But don't miss! </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What problems did you encounter when you were 
    developing this quest? </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Originally, I had the entry portal to the “Precarious Sojourn” dungeon 
    floating a ways away from the suspension bridge. The concept was that 
    players would have to do a “leap of faith.” Properly quest-flagged, they 
    would succeed. Otherwise--well, there are numerous skeletons down at the 
    bottom of the cliff. Happy landings! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the first problems appeared when I was 
    trying to test the portal's placement. This test essentially consists of 
    playing <i>AC </i>on a private server located on my computer. It isn't 
    completely independent though; the local server is still linked to a remote 
    database server that stores and retrieves game information. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When I had placed the portal in Worldbuilder, 
    our in-house content tool, I had it floating out in the air at the end of 
    the bridge. However when I would enter the game world on my private server, 
    the portal was completely missing. After tracking the problem down, I found 
    that the portal was falling to the earth below and disappearing. Modifying 
    the portal's properties and setting the portal to ignore gravity made it 
    essentially weightless and kept it from falling and disappearing. While this 
    seems obvious, Worldbuilder had given nary a clue that this was going on and 
    had given the appearance that the portal was floating exactly where I put 
    it. Okay, fine! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The placement of the portal caused another 
    problem. I had placed it close enough to the bridge so that if you strained 
    forward, you would get sucked through. However, for some reason this would 
    cause you to appear at the arrival point with an incredibly high forward 
    velocity, flinging you, screaming and flailing, to the hard soil of the 
    Direlands far below. This was a bit more of an arrival thrill than I had 
    intended! Sean Dickinson [Data Integrator for <i>AC</i>] suggested putting 
    up invisible walls to contain the errant characters. For some reason the 
    portal was adding inertia to the avatar. The invisible walls were a simple 
    solution and they seem to have worked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another issue turned up when I was scripting 
    the Slithe Traddittor NPC. I wanted to push the tech a little so that 
    players could hand in the bronze statue parts in any order. This sounds like 
    a simple goal, but it's harder to implement than it sounds. In <i>AC1</i>, 
    the scripting process that makes our NPCs function requires a certain degree 
    of programming logic. In the end, I could see a couple of ways that it could 
    be made to work. And it did too, but not without everyone racking their 
    brains over it. Half the time, I still expect Slithe Traddittor to hand me a 
    toaster-oven instead of the Arcane Pedestal. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Was there anything in the quest that you wanted to 
    do, but couldn't, for whatever reason? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    I would have loved to make the floating dungeon much bigger, more elaborate, 
    and with more monsters. Unfortunately, performance concerns prevented that. 
    I also would have liked a greater variety of architecture and platforms of 
    different sizes. The landscape is a grid of 24-meter by 24-meter squares 
    called “land cells.” The current platforms have to take up a full land cell 
    horizontally. That's really too far to jump, straight horizontally. With 
    smaller platforms and tighter distances I could have added more jumping 
    puzzle dynamics to the dungeon. I sometimes find jumping puzzles as 
    frustrating as the next gamer, but as a designer I feel obligated to create 
    at least one! </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>There are a number of steps in completing the quest 
    and receiving the final reward. How did you determine the number of steps 
    you wanted to use to complete it? Do you go into a quest thinking of how 
    long you want it to take the players to complete it? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    A quest has several stages. First is the “introduction,” where the player is 
    given some of the background lore and receives the “mission statement.” Then 
    comes “questing,” in which the player goes off to accomplish the mission, 
    during which several varieties of mayhem are bound to occur. Eventually the 
    player reaches the “reward” stage, but this can have several sub-stages. The 
    reward can depend on, among other things, whether the player finds the final 
    quest item in a chest, has to craft it, or have an NPC give it to them. It 
    can be fun for players to assemble an item, but it didn't make sense that 
    they could do that in this quest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With regard to how long I wanted the quest to 
    take, the story really influenced my decision. Slithe is a thrall of Gaerlan 
    and wants to be able to produce a number of these devices for him. The 
    length of a quest has to “feel right.” It would have been too short if all 
    the players had to do was capture the image of the Pedestal in the Imaging 
    crystal and hand it to Slithe. Also, since the Arcane Pedestal is partially 
    a mechanical device, it made sense to use some of the bronze statue parts 
    that had recently been added to the game. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Alatar Locke, the long lost explorer, reappeared in 
    your quest! Was he in the quest from the beginning, or was he just a bit of 
    flash that came later? </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    My initial concept for the quest was that the character now known as Slithe 
    would be a Cartographer and would offer the map as a reward to players who 
    brought him the pedestal. This changed at some point, and during a team 
    meeting when I was outlining the quest, Allan suggested that Alatar Locke 
    give players the map of Dereth, using the floating tower as a good vantage 
    point to draw it from. I thought that was a good idea so why not? </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>For quite a while, you were involved in placing 
    housing on the landscape. Was it a relief to start doing something other 
    than housing? </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
