      February 2001</b></span><br>
      The powers of magic had been growing ever since the defeat of the
      Hopeslayer. Magi of the School of the Arm had already gained access to
      another sphere of influence and now they had uncovered the secrets of an
      ancient order of Empyrean warrior magi who stood resolute against the
      darkness during their greatest age. Those who command the sphere of War,
      able to find and pass the tests placed before them are able to forge
      Thaumaturgic and Exarch Platemail. This armor is light enough to be worn
      by mages, yet is endowed with mystical energies that afford its creator
      the defenses of the heartiest warrior.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">As the School of the Arm found the Essence of
      Strife during the month of Snowreap, so too has the School of the Right
      Hand found an essence bound to Derethian “enchanting” magic.
      Sequestered in the wilderness and surrounded by a Menhir, the pulsing
      Essence of Artifice grants spells of the seventh circle to all who feed it
      the most powerful item scrolls found on the Obsidian Plains. Armed with
      these humbling spells magi now harden their armor and further hone the
      steel of their weapons, making them more fearsome then ever before.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Furthering the resurgence of magic, deep
      within the Mines of Despair can be found an oblong stone. Adventurers have
      discovered that this stone, carried by an ancient guardian, can be
      enhanced within the very heart of the dungeon using a piece of their
      essence and powerful returned magic. The resultant item hardens the mind
      and heightens the focus of whoever uses the stone, pulling away their
      access to Mana at the same time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But all is not well on Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tumeroks have moved onto the desert plains
      and opened installations there. Deep beneath the sands their vanguard
      forces prepare what appears to be a staging point. They have sent only an
      expeditionary force to fortify these bases but there can be no question as
      to the ill nature of their intent. Those who have entered these fortresses
      have returned with tales of the denizens within and the items of power
      they have retrieved.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Deep within the quagmire, scrawled in his
      own hand, Sir Candeth Martine continues his story for those with the
      fortitude to follow him. The darkness within him grows and the grim trail
      he leaves will take its toll on even most stalwart warrior's mind. The
      changes within the man are growing more obvious with each letter he leaves
      travelers to find; it is a trail that has become rife with murder and ill
      tidings. At the hands of the Virindi his awareness has been heightened and
      he has become something not wholly human. His tale now leads adventurers
      back to the captors that traded him to the Virindi, the Mosswarts deep
      within the swamp. Brave parties recount his tale while speaking at taverns
      or in the company of the smithies shining their newest creations, the
      naginata.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As new arrivals are met with the friendly
      gestures of Helpers something wicked brews in the heart and sky of Dereth.
      The sky itself is filled with an unearthly amethyst hue. The land itself
      is now bathed in a lavender blanket that reminds the Children of Ispar
      that all is not well. The Hopeslayer may be gone, but there are other
      enemies who would take his place and remove the Children of Ispar from
      this world.</font>
