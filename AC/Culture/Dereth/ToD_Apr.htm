		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=367">Turbine Site</a> 
		- April 22, 2005</font></span><p><font face="Arial">It has been a while, 
		hasn't it?&nbsp; I have two messages to deliver to you today:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">1: We're pushing the expansion pack launch back. 
		The new launch date is July 18. </font></p>
		<font face="Arial">There isn't any way to sugarcoat that and you 
		probably like it as little as we do, but there are good reasons for it.
		</font>
		<p><font face="Arial">The main reason?&nbsp; As you probably know, we did 
		some closed focus testing with several groups of players last month, in 
		preparation for the upcoming general Player Preview.&nbsp; Before we put the 
		Preview in front of the toughest audience in the world, AC players, we 
		wanted to put the game in front of, well, some of the toughest audience 
		in the world, just to make sure we had the game we thought we had.&nbsp; This 
		seemed only prudent, and we made sure we had players from a wide range 
		of servers, including Darktide.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">The upshot is:&nbsp; Boy, are we glad we did that.&nbsp; It 
		was interesting, if your definition of 'interesting' is having your 
		flaws pointed out in graphic detail.&nbsp; The feedback we got from the 
		players was great, very detailed and specific and delivered with tough 
		love.&nbsp; What they told us is that we had some changes to make.&nbsp; And we 
		took that feedback to heart and have started to make some of those 
		changes, but it is going to take some time.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Don't get the idea I'm blaming the delay on the 
		players; if anything, we should have caught some of the issues they 
		noted earlier.&nbsp; As we all know, however, we can all get too close to our 
		babies; that's why you have testing.&nbsp; The testers have improved Throne 
		of Destiny with their comments and we're indebted to them.&nbsp; Besides, I 
		don't know the development team that doesn't want more time to optimize 
		code.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">We'll still be having the Player Preview; Ibn will 
		deliver more info on that next week.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">2: I'm leaving the AC Team and Turbine.&nbsp; Today is 
		my last day here. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Before the conspiracy theorists drown out the rest 
		of us, this is in no way connected with the launch delay discussed 
		above.&nbsp; In fact, I, among others, lobbied hard to get that delay and the 
		fact that we got it – even though Turbine is going to take a financial 
		hit on marketing and distribution money that has already been spent and 
		a confidence hit with some of your fellow players – should prove that 
		this company is committed to giving you quality.&nbsp; In the old adage of 
		&quot;You can have it good or you can have it Tuesday,&quot; the company chose the 
		former.&nbsp; How many times have we seen companies choose Tuesday, instead?&nbsp; 
		It doesn't guarantee a flawless launch, but it does reduce the risks to 
		one and that's the best any of us can hope for.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">So, no, the reason I'm leaving isn't about the 
		delay; my reasons are my own and don't involve dark portents.&nbsp; 
		(Remember, the Illuminati have nothing to do with my leaving.&nbsp; No, 
		really.&nbsp; Honest.) In the meantime, you are in good hands with srand as 
		Live Producer, backed up by Ibn, meanbeard, Scenario and the rest of the 
		crew, some of the best developers I've ever worked with.&nbsp; Almost all of 
		them came to the team as AC players – one of you and a part of you, in 
		fact – with years of experience in the game; I don't think any other 
		MMORPG can say that about their Live Team.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">I'll still be around the industry, but I'm going 
		to miss the team and I'm going to miss you guys.&nbsp; AC is still my 
		favorite online RPG; I played it long before joining Turbine and I'll be 
		exploring Dereth years from now.&nbsp; For all that a few of you are the most 
		cantankerous players on the face of the earth, as a whole you're the 
		best community I've been part of to date.&nbsp; After nineteen years and 
		being part of more MMOGs than perhaps anyone in the industry, that's 
		saying something.&nbsp; It has been a privilege to serve you, truly.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">And who knows?&nbsp; Maybe one day I'll actually make 
		it out of the Training Academy on Darktide without getting ganked.</font></p>
