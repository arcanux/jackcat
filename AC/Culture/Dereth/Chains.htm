      June 6, 2001</font></p>
      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">The air in the underground meeting hall was
      quite cool -- a welcome relief to Thane Tuomas and his scribe, out all day
      in the sweltering sun. “Take this down,” said the Thane, as the scribe
      dutifully raised his quill to the parchment.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Court held tonight, sunset, in the Tufa
      hall. Bring any information you've been able to gather regarding the
      recent abductions. Mages, be here on time and well stocked with
      components. You've no more excuses to dawdle!”</font> <br>
&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scribe wrote furiously, and nodded.
      “Aye, sir. They'll have this missive momentarily.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was more like it, so far as Tuomas was
      concerned. Communication had become a more pressing matter of late, yet
      here was finally an easy means of disseminating information. More like it,
      indeed. Organized. Like the archmages. Somehow those scatterbrained old
      chaps had been able to handle his request for components in record time.
      Yes, organized.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Fault those Virindi for what you will,
      Landry, but they've got their chain of command in tip-top shape.
      Priorities, you know. There's no mistakes with the Virindi.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“But, m'lord? The abductions? And the
      awful business in Ayan? Surely, you don't. . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tuomas silenced his scribe with a glare.
      “No, Landry, I haven't lost sight of it all. Now, don't you have a
      message to deliver?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The young man bowed politely and scampered
      away.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the torchlight, the Thane pulled a mask
      from his beltpouch, watching as firelight played over the impossibly
      smooth surface. He thought about the words of the creature who'd given it
      to him. Tuomas pressed the mask to his face and cast his gaze about the
      hall where his subjects would soon come to gather. The more he thought
      about it, the more it made sense. There would be no missions to the
      northern or southern mountains. Let the hunters tarry with their freshly
      tanned hides, shells, and pearls. No need to interrupt the progress.
      Things were changing, and for the better. They were getting more. . .
      organized.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the
      world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. Last month, as pyreals became
      weightless, players began to receive the coordinates for their corpses,
      and adventurers were able to quest for new titles. One can only wonder
      what additions, what changes -- and what dangers -- will be added when we
      open our June event, “<i>Chains of Command</i>.” For further hint of
      what's to come, be sure to read up on the new <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEcompbuying.asp" target="_blank">Component
      Buyer</a> and <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEallegiancecomm.asp" target="_blank">Allegiance

      <img src="Chains/side_virindi.jpg" width="80" height="104" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The sun has begun to rise, brighter,
      hotter, crossing the horizon with the burning fury of an Ivory Gromnie's
      smelting breath. The torrid days of summer have come at last. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">. . . and with them comes another menace.
      Organized groups of marauding “Black Claw” Drudges have appeared in
      the northern and southern mountains of Osteth. Rumors speak of their
      involvement with a cabal of Virindi, whose hidden leader, known only as
      the Inculcator, is reputed to have been the true mastermind behind the
      takeover of Ayan Baqur. Perhaps the time has come to take the battle back
      to the Virindi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the effort to truly succeed, however,
      will require both sword and spell. To this end, human legions have
      instituted further improvements within their own ranks. Allegiances can
      now nominate designated speakers, who, along with their monarchs, are able
      to spread news among their every member with the speed of the wind itself.
      Archmages have long promoted the sale of spell components, putting the
      common good of all spellcasters ahead of the miserly hoarding of arcane
      secrets. Archmage vendors have proven even more cooperative of late,
      filling entire component buy lists instead of individual orders. And as
      the mystic geomancy of the land continues to fluctuate, more powerful
      creature enchantments have entered the School of the Left Hand; in
      addition, all lower-level enchantments have seen their durations increase,
      allowing enchanters an even greater role in aiding their fellows.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet beyond the crusade to strike back at
      the Virindi, other goals stand to be completed. For hunters, the changing
      of the seasons marks further chance to collect shed trophies of creatures.
      And with the end of spring, so comes a final gift of spring-cleaning.
      Inhabitants of Dereth will discover a fresher item in their wardrobes --
      though they may wonder what became of their older, soiled garments.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not
      everything has been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      all that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town criers,
      barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of
      crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and
      abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>

          world, including the chance to discover new Virindi strongholds and to
          do battle with the enigmatic beings in their own halls.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lower-level buffs no longer evaporate so
          readily, as all level 1 to 5 buffs see their durations greatly
          increased.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Another season of the year means another
          season of critter hunting, with new trophies being shed.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Niffis, Tumeroks, and Crystals become
          less frustrating beasts to fight as monster rebalancing efforts

    <p><img src="Chains/pic_magicwords.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="120"><font face="Arial" size="2">With 
    the opening of our June event, “<i>Chains of Command</i>,” allegiance 
    members will be able to take advantage of several new communication 
    features: allegiance speakers, allegiance-wide broadcasts, messages of the 
    day, and co-vassal chat. These features will provide members an even greater 
    ability to keep in touch with one another and stay up-to-date on allegiance 
    events -- allowing for even further conquests to be made in Dereth! </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Allegiance Speakers </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Monarchs can now designate a member of their allegiance to act as its 
    speaker. There may only be one speaker at a time, and the monarch can set 
    and change the speaker at any time using the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@speaker set &lt;player&gt;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This command removes the old speaker and 
    promotes the new speaker to the office. The monarch may also remove the 
    current speaker without setting a new one with the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@speaker clear</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These two commands are only usable by the 
    monarch. However, all players in an allegiance may see who the speaker for 
    their allegiance currently is with the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@speaker</i> </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Allegiance-Wide Broadcasts </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The monarch and his or her speaker can broadcast allegiance-wide messages to 
    everyone in the allegiance. Each of these persons is limited to three 
    broadcasts per day. The monarch cannot get around this limit by appointing a 
    new speaker -- the new speaker “inherits” the number of broadcasts that the 
    old speaker made. A monarch or speaker can make an allegiance-wide broadcast 
    using the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@a &lt;message&gt;</i> </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Message of the Day </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Monarchs are able to create a message of the day (MOTD) that their 
    allegiance members can view at any time. The monarch sets the MOTD using the 
    command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@motd set &lt;message&gt;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The MOTD has the same limit on length that 
    any message typed into the chat box does. The monarch can clear the MOTD 
    using the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@motd clear</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Only the monarch can set and clear the MOTD. 
    However, any player in an allegiance may view the MOTD using the command:
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@motd</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the MOTD (if there is one) 
    displays at logon. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Co-Vassal Chat </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    A patron can chat with all of his or her vassals at once using the command
    <i>@v &lt;message</i>&gt;. Co-vassal chat now gives a similar ability to the 
    vassals. Players may chat with their patrons and all of their patrons' other 
    vassals (their co-vassals) using the command: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>@c &lt;message&gt;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that the patron in this triangle should 
    respond with <i>@v &lt;message</i>&gt;, because if he uses <i>@c </i>he will then 
    be talking to his patron and co-vassals.</font></p>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>
	</font> 
	<p>The weary archer strode from the lifestone, wiping a mixture of dust, 
    dirt, and Ravener entrails from his new helm with a mud-spattered towel, and 
    thinking to himself that it certainly was a worthwhile trip, in spite of the 
    new scars and stains… </p>
    <p>The worn path lay empty before him, with only the occasional traveler to 
    be seen.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;Glancing nervously up and down the hill, the hairs on the back of 
    his neck stood on end. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>He had only arrived in Ayan Baqur a few short weeks 
    ago, and had never seen it so devoid of life… </p>
    <p>He jerked to a halt in surprise as a voice shattered the still night air: 
    &quot;Arrr, it's good to be back here. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>That Virindi dungeon smelled bad. For such 
    a light and airy bunch of people, they sure are smelly!&quot; As he moved closer 
    he saw light pouring from the front door of the Smoking Axe Tavern, 
    silhouetting a robed figure carrying an empty mug and yelling at the top of 
    its lungs. </p>
    <p>&quot;Ha, those Virindi thought they could keep me down... Not old Ulgrim, my 
    friend, I'm too wily for them! I was prepared for their mind tricks!&quot; 
    Lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper as the archer passed, Ulgrim 
    gruffly told the empty shadows, &quot;In all seriousness though, Lacandrillar and 
    Adirred were some of the scariest folks I've ever met. Incomprehensible most 
    of the time, but very scary.&quot; </p>
    <p>Scratching his head in confusion, the befuddled archer continued, 
    continued his solemn walk to the Secluded Sanctuary. Maybe he could find 
    some answers there. </p>
    <p>Or at the very least a healing kit, maybe even a fresh towel. </p>

    <p>CHAINS OF COMMAND<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal"> <br>
    </span>With the introduction of the <i>Chains of Command</i> event, the 
    winds of change are sweeping across Dereth once more, scouring the bones of 
    the fallen with the dust of time, and scattering the people of Dereth to the 
    four winds.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;Previously empty towns, visited only by the occasional traveler 
    or merchant, are now bustling with activity as more people move back into 
    the heart of Osteth and towards a center of commerce. </p>
    <p>Travelers from the distant deserts return bearing strange shells and 
    speaking of spectacular new armor and items. Adventurers and mages speak of 
    battling a strange new band of Drudges known as the Black Claw, and 
    displaying magnificent items of powerful enchantment. </p>
    <p>And with the return of these intrepid adventurers comes the return of 
    lost friends, as the defeat of the Inculcator frees the imprisoned people of 
    Ayan Baqur and restores both their minds and their willpower, although in 
    some cases the change is not a very noticeable one. </p>
    <p>With the release of the townsfolk of Ayan Baqur and the returning of 
    their wits, the merchants of Dereth seem to have found a new lust for life, 
    or at least a newfound interest in creature comforts. They have refined 
    their pricing to allow themselves a more reasonable profit margin. </p>
    <p>And through it all a slightly less malodorous feeling permeates the air, 
    as young and old alike replace their old worn undergarments with slightly 
    fresher ones. Leave it to Maggie the Jackcat to find someone willing to 
    model in their refreshing new undergarments.

    it out here</a>! </p>
    <p>There have also been changes to the pursuits of the Arcane. Newfound 
    spells await those powerful enough to reach the seventh circle of the Left 
    Hand. Even those of lesser abilities will find that their enchantments last 
    longer. In addition to the new spells and improvements, a new system for 
    purchasing spell components has been introduced, allowing for the purchase 
    of a pre-set list of components. </p>
    <p>For a detailed list of all new additions and changes this month be sure 
    to consult the

    <p>A LETTER TO THE PLAYER ON SPEEDHACKING<b> </b></p>
    <p>June 15, 2001 </p>
    <p>As most players are aware, additional code was devised for the June event 
    by which players who used speed-altering programs could be detected and 
    removed from the game. </p>
    <p>The most concrete solution for the short term turned out to be the 
    removal of the Speedhack detection code, to be reviewed, fixed, and 
    reinstated at a future update. However, while instability resulted, the 
    detection code did accurately detect several players who were using 
    speed-altering programs in violation of the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://go.msn.com/newsletter3817/35367.asp">Code of 
    Conduct</a>. Appropriate action has been taken in those cases, and we remind 
    players that use of speed-altering programs can result in removal from the 
    game. </p>
    <p>We sincerely apologize for the extended downtime, and intend to 
    reintroduce the detection code as soon as we can verify its stability. We 
    thank you for your patience, and hope you enjoy the rest of the June event, 
    &quot;<i>Chains of Command</i>.&quot; </p>

    <p>ASHERON'S CALL: DARK MAJESTY EXPANSION PACK AVAILABLE THIS HOLIDAY </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Microsoft today announced that the Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty 
    Expansion Pack will be available this holiday at retail locations throughout 
    North America. The first of its kind for the franchise, this expansion pack 
    includes the original Asheron's Call as well as many new features and a 
    compelling new landmass. Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty will be available at 
    retail for only US$19.95 and will include one free month of play. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;Turbine is very excited about the expansion pack, and our continued 
    relationship with Microsoft. The Asheron's Call franchise is a very 
    important part of our company,&quot; noted Jeffrey Anderson, President and CEO of 
    Turbine. &quot;We are firmly committed to developing and delivering high-quality 
    online entertainment.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Expansion Pack delivers on new additions such as housing and storage, 
    two of the features most requested by our customers. Players will be able to 
    purchase their own homes on designated plots of land, as well as use their 
    residence for secure storage purposes. The Expansion Pack also kicks off the 
    next chapter in the on-going Asheron's Call story line by introducing the 
    island of Marae Lassel. Marae Lassel is a sprawling new landmass, which will 
    contain new quests, dungeons, and treasures and will be accessible to all 
    levels of players who purchase the Asheron's Call Expansion Pack. </p>
    <p>Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty builds upon the epic, evolving storyline by 
    paving the way for the return of an old nemesis. &quot;We don't want to give 
    everything away,&quot; says Nik Davidson, producer of the Expansion Pack, &quot;but 
    suffice to say that the name of the expansion pack is a big clue.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Microsoft is making a significant investment in Asheron's Call with both 
    the expansion pack and in the sequel to Asheron's Call which we announced 
    earlier this year,&quot; explained Matthew Ford, Lead Program Manager for 
    Asheron's Call. </p>
