      <p>
		<img border="0" src="Victory/hist2.JPG.html" width="150" height="135" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the beginning of Verdantine, shooting
      stars began to grace the heavens with increasing frequency. Sages
      theorized this to be related to the mounting activity of the Shadows, who
      had lain largely dormant since their attacks in the month of Morningthaw.&nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Bizarre organic messengers taken from Shadows
      revealed they were not monolithic after all. Rather, they seemed to be
      split into three distinct factions. One group remained loyal to
      Bael'Zharon. Another, alarmed by the Hopeslayer's blind rage and working
      to keep him imprisoned, had sworn allegiance to his general Isin Dule. The
      last faction was barely comprehensible. Loyal to neither Bael'Zharon nor
      Dule, they obsessed over “opening the ways” for something greater yet
      than even the dread Hopeslayer.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is thought that the minions of
      Bael'Zharon were responsible for the so-called “arenas” that appeared
      at this time. The portals to these underground complexes remained
      restricted to those who had sworn to serve the Lord of Chaos. Reports of
      what lay within were hard to come by, but those few willing to talk
      mentioned gladiatorial blood sports fought between, and judged by,
      Bael'Zharon's human servants. It was assumed that these arenas were built
      to hone the prowess of the Hopeslayer's followers for the coming struggle.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meantime, the Dericost undead mobilized at
      the behest of the Aerfalle, the powerful Lady of Aerlinthe. Adventurers
      intercepted many messages between the various factions of their society
      that spoke of gathering armies and collecting intelligence. The Isparians
      seemed to have gained an ally of sorts against the minions of Bael'Zharon,
      though perhaps not one they would have chosen themselves. Whereas the
      Shadows sought to absorb all life, the undead seemed intent upon
      conquering the living after beating back “the enemy.” Things seemed
      bleak for humanity no matter what the outcome of this conflict.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the midst of the alarming news,
      reclusive mage Aliester the Loquacious discovered that Shadowhunter Armor,
      crafted from magical gems, could be “attuned” to the elemental
      properties of the gemstones created by the Yalaini enchanter Lady Maila.
      Although the plates of armor forged by master smiths were still of lesser
      quality than those made before Hamud ibn Rafik's vicious attacks,
      inserting any of the stones used in Lord Atlan's ancient weapons could
      nevertheless enhance them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wanderers braving the untamed wilds of the
      southern Direlands discovered that a clan of undead had recently taken up
      residence within three towers along the coast. After slaughtering all
      those within the towers, a passage was found to a long-hidden underground
      temple complex, inhabited by a long-lost cult of the undead. The slaying
      of their High Acolyte yielded a rather distasteful reward. . . although
      certain of Dereth's crafters found this object valuable, indeed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scholars of Zaikhal, Cragstone, and
      Hebian-to announced that they sought additions for the great libraries of
      those towns. Three winners were selected from each heritage group. The Sho
      cleaned space on their shelves for Ja'afar al-Saladin of Solclaim's &quot;<i>The
      Emperor's Blade</i>,” Loka Wu of Morningthaw's &quot;<i>Loka Jii Learns
      to Hunt</i>,&quot; and Nandesu Ka of Leafcull's &quot;<i>Journal of
      Nandesu Ka</i>.” Aluvians burned many candles reading Vexorg of
      Thistledown's &quot;<i>The D00dz</i>,” Aytalya of Darktide's &quot;<i>Shadows
      of My Doubts</i>,” and Aragorn of Thistledown's &quot;<i>The Journals of
      Change</i>&quot; late into the night. The Gharu'ndim pondered the words of
      Anjwar al-Jaenth of Morningthaw's &quot;<i>Recalling The Calling</i>,&quot;
      Ariq al-Binara of Frostfell's &quot;<i>Derethian Skies</i>,&quot; and
      Ashgad of Thistledown's &quot;<i>Midnight Revelation</i>.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chocolate, a legendary delicacy from old
      Ispar, was discovered in the grubby hands of mosswarts and banderlings.
      Half-remembered tales of its delicious taste and aroma lead to a massive
      hunt to replicate the lost recipes of the human homeworld.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Khallayne and Raynie of Thistledown
      provided chocolate milk. Rhiannon Morgana and Touryan Kurigsun of
      Frostfell supplied chocolate cake. Betty Crocker of Leafcull, one of the
      famous chefs of Cragstone Farms Catering, created chocolate ice cream.
      Chen Kenichi of Frostfell, part of the ill-starred adventuring troupe
      Vitae Rising, produced the chocolate bar, known colloquially as the
      “Vitae Bar.” Chen proudly noted that infamous beating-magnet Wi loved
      his creation. Ho Chun and Theran Bakagin of Frostfell, meanwhile, leavened
      the somewhat bitter Vitae Bar into a creamy milk chocolate bar.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aiyaan Shiefu of Leafcull, a member of the
      Silver Citadel allegiance, whipped up Dereth's first cup of hot mocha.
      Yakamura Shinji of Frostfell added ice to mocha, resulting in a refreshing
      drink for a lazy summer afternoon (assuming one can ever be found in
      Dereth). Atsushi and Deckape of Morningthaw added cinnamon to Aiyaan's
      original creation to create rich mocha. Elanwen of Harvestgain, with help
      from Jenna, combined the work of all the various mocha brewers into rich
      iced mocha.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although most people focused on chocolate,
      the residents of Holtburg, a town known for rampant cattle mutilations,
      fried up a slab of Bessie MCMLXII and served her on a bun, thus adding the
      “Holtburger” to Dereth's dietary lexicon. In other news of culinary
      horror, a shadowy figure known only as “The Sausage King of Dereth”
      skulked in the darkest corners of Fort Tethana, combining all manner of
      unsavory things into links of something that was almost, but not quite,
      entirely unlike meat. He was last seen pulling on a pair of steel-toed
      boots and wandering into the desert, muttering, “Fools! I'll destroy
      them all!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the month, an oppressive
      silence fell over the hills and vales of Dereth. The world held its
      breath, and wondered . . .</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="History5.htm">Continued</a></font></td>
