		<font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Diary.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Creating art for AC1 is buried in tons of 
		specs and questions. Even discovering what those are is an ongoing 
		process, and mixed in with that is business as usual. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My first job this morning was to answer 
		emails from our out-sourcers concerning the specs on Rare objects. To 
		ensure that we can get as much art as possible into <i>Throne of Destiny</i>, 
		we've outsourced some of the load to a dedicated art studio. Naturally 
		they have questions. How many polys can we use? How big? What does the 
		Rare look like? I also had to remind them to make them clean enough so 
		that they don't get hung up in the integration process, and also to make 
		icons to go with them. I had sent them sample objects for reference on 
		size and placement a few weeks ago. They definitely helped, because I'm 
		getting the setups back with the new objects correctly placed. The next 
		task was answering questions about the opening cinematic. We have to 
		think about the characters, landscape, building designs and lighting 
		renders. Then I mocked up reference materials to display what the 
		process of palletizing textures is and how it affects colors in specific 
		sub-palette registers. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All this is done in conjunction with 
		Ming, our in-house implant from the out-source team. I sure do admire 
		him. He knows how to use Excel. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next I reviewed the last of the building 
		texture batches that came back from the out-sourcers. That's 1000 down, 
		5500 more to go. Whew! Unfortunately I had to send back 23 because they 
		needed a few improvements. So only 977 down, 5523 to go. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Chris, &quot;DarkDagon&quot;, has been working on 
		creating the new Viamontian objects and buildings. Integration has been 
		the real tear-jerker on this. The geometry has to be just right. At 
		times it feels like creating a ship in a bottle. I'm scheduled to help 
		him create this art but lately other issues have been higher priority. 
		I've been throwing other things his way also. He concepted most of the 
		art for the Viamontians, I'm asking him to help with the website and 
		forum art requests that Ibn sends us, and he's also reviewing textures 
		as they come in. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It's also in our best interest to keep 
		him creating the new in-house objects and building at this point. The 
		problem is that, because of some of the engine work we're doing, we 
		can't see our new buildings in game yet. So, to help get the designers 
		started placing the new POI's and buildings we're integrating the 
		buildings without textures. When the engineers tell us that the game is 
		ready to display the new textures, we'll reprocess the same objects.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've now come full circle. I'll be trying 
		once again today to do the Viamontian face art. Yesterday in a 
		discussion with Ming I discovered that it will be necessary to create a 
		drawing template to provide to the out-sourcers, so they know where not 
		to redraw all the face parts. These parts get put together on geometry 
		and if the seams don't match it becomes noticeable. This is good to 
		start from, because I needed to know this before I started the new 
		heritage faces. Hopefully I'll get to those today, or tonight.</font></p>
