      January 3, 2001</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amurra, perched on a stone outcrop, blew on
      her hands. The late frost was sinking into everyone's bones. “I still
      can't believe they managed to defeat the Hopeslayer. A demon of this
      world, thousands of years old, and more powerful than Asheron! It is truly
      a testament to the human spirit, isn't it Gideon?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon looked up from fletching quarrels.
      Can she not see that I'm busy? One of us must have a clue as to what's
      going on around. These mountains are dangerous! “Yes, sure. Human
      spirit. Testament. Huzzah for the war mages. Why don't you stop talking
      and hand me that letter MacNiall gave us?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amurra glowered at him, but dug in her pack
      until she found it. Eyes narrowed, she walked over and handed him the
      letter with testy deliberation.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon perused it while packing his gear.
      He was curious about what MacNiall would have to say to his cousin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Look Gideon,” Amurra said crossly,
      “I'm tired of you treating me like some second-rate vagabond. I know
      what I'm doing! Even the Zharalim respect me more than you do.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gideon frowned. How am I supposed to
      concentrate with her prattling on like this? He turned to her, impatient--</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">--and saw the Iron Golem charging from
      behind. An old and scathing Aluvian curse fell stillborn in his mouth.
      “Golem!” he simply yelped instead, and scrambled for his crossbow.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still scowling, Amurra turned around as
      Gideon fumbled to load a barbed quarrel he'd paid for through the nose.
      Yet instead of backing away from the Golem, she began to cast, an odd
      purplish glow manifesting between her fingers. Titanic gouts of acid
      surged from her hands, reducing the Golem to its base components.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Bet you won't treat me like a sidekick
      now,” she proudly chirped.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bemused, Gideon nodded, wondering from
      where the Iron Golem had come.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the 
      world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve with each and every month. New 
      lands have been discovered, new creatures battled. Towns and seasons have 
      even come and gone. Last month the dread Hopeslayer, Bael'Zharon, walked 
      abroad, spreading terror with every step. One can only wonder what changes 
      and additions will soon take place when we open our January event, “<i>Now 
      in this Hush</i>.”<br>
      <br>
      Be sure to continue your part in this incredible ongoing story -- and

      <br>
      Carefully. . . cautiously. . .&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      . . . cellar doors have begun to unlock. Hastily erected barricades have started to come down. Once more, the people of Dereth poke their heads back into the world to see if all is well.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Last month, the dread Hopeslayer, Bael'Zharon, walked the land. In his path -- epic terror. Many a good hero fled, or perished in trying to face him. Yet just at hope's end, a valiant quest -- organized by Lord Asheron himself -- succeeded, imprisoning the dread Hopeslayer within a second, stronger crystal prison.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Yet will this prison hold?&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      As the people of Dereth reemerge from their cellars and other places of hiding, they'll find that with Bael'Zharon defeated, the world has reverted to its more natural order. Along with the dread Hopeslayer, also gone are the rivers and rains of blood. The skies have cleared, and there are even signs of mild winter setting in. The world, seemingly, has recovered.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Still, no one believes all danger has been forever banished. Not here. Not in Dereth.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      As a result of the struggle against Bael'Zharon, improvements have developed in certain ways of war. Veteran mages from the School of the Arm now cast spells mightier than anything yet seen before -- mighty enough to reduce fey and feral beasts to smoldering piles of ash. Then there are those warriors who took up, not magic, but blades against Bael'Zharon. From the perilous lessons learned in the fighting, many claim that deadly new feats with light swords and daggers are now possible; yet it may be that such swashbuckling tricks remain the secret of Dereth's bandits. In addition, a further quest has come about, concerning the land's most famous sword. . . somehow related to the site of Bael'Zharon's former prison, now marked with a tribute to its defense.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Is this improved sword, then, a reward from Lord Asheron? Or a subtle reminder of evil's power, from the dread Hopeslayer himself?&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Following is a list of the most interesting additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Highlights include:&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new dagger quest has been introduced.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the Sword of Lost Hope
          quest was added as a result of Bael'Zharon's defeat.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New level VII War Magic spells have been
          introduced. Now you can really show the monsters of Dereth who's in
          charge!</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fellowships that consist entirely of
          players level 50 and above now share XP equally, regardless of how far
          apart in level players are from the fellowship leader.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Wintertime has come to the land of
          Dereth. Let there be snow (and snowmen, too)!</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The level restrictions to the Fenmalain
          and Caulnalain portals have been increased.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Master archmage vendors now sell portal
          gems. A good way of getting rid of some of that extra pyreal bogging
          you down. In return, recall to some of your favorite towns.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Tumerok Overlord now carries a key;
          his loot has been moved to a chest. The key is quest-flagged with an

      </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. You must have your question typed out 
      and ready to cut &amp; paste when your turn is up <br>
      2. Limit one question per person will be strictly enforced. <br>
      3. The question *must* appear in the first line you post. If not, you will

      6. Repeat Questions will not get a response other then “Asked and

    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please watch for your question being asked 
    before you. As always, the Code of Conduct is in full effect during the 
    chat. This is all in an effort to keep the chat running more smoothly, make 
    it more informative and give more people a chance to ask questions. With 
    that, I will hand over the floor to Nik for introductions and we will be off 
    to the questions. <br>

    big question is: What did you guys do to Crank!? :) He has been working so 
    much that he is now home sick. After Nei told me about this horrible 
    tragedy, I decided to make a little film about what could have happened to 
    Crank. It can be viewed at http://www.geocities.com/pwochaz69/cranknei.gif . 
    Tomfoolery! Anyways, Crank and Nei r0x0r!!! Hogwash. Tomfoolery.

    Xeno_RhubarbPie&gt; Done :) Oh yeah and DT owns ;p btw carebears: STOP 
    messaging me saying &quot;ask the devs about pink dye plz!!!&quot; </b><br>

    <br>
    Nik@turbine&gt; Well, as far as we can tell, it's not god mode. Some of it has 
    to do with the way DT population spreads out - at any given time, there are 
    people in more places on DT than on other worlds. <br>
    <br>
    Nik@turbine&gt; It's something we're working on. Beyond that, I can't say much.

    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; Do NOT get me started! <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; :-) <br>
    <br>
    Crowley@turbine&gt; I actually think our graphics are pretty good in comparison 
    to others. Some areas are strongers than others, definitely. But this is 
    Sean's deal, I think. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; To allow for a huge set of options, much of the graphic work 
    in AC had to be limited in appearance... <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; ...for example, palettizing images allows us to have a bu-zillion 
    colors for clothing, but to get that we sacrifice a little detail. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; Also, when we shipped, we had to meet a minimum system 
    requirement that is now generally considered to be obsolete. But you can 
    still play AC on a low-end system. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; Ok, you got me started. :-) <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; When it comes to game reviews, I honestly think that most of 
    the people who put our graphics below some of our competition played for a 
    few hours (like most reviewers) then gave up, and judged us on a very small 
    set of game graphics. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; I have never heard of any other game where people have 
    e-mailed us telling us that after running over the crest of a hill, they 
    just stopped and stared at the sun until it set. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; Added to that we have a firmly established commitment to 
    improve graphics where we can. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; New models for tuskers, drudges, and higher poly models for 
    NEW creatures are just a few steps we have taken. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; The thing is that we still are committed to running on low end 
    systems as well, and while graphics scale fairly well, with degrade modes, 
    and graphics settings, our sound engine is not as scalable, so adding lots 
    of great new sounds would increase memory <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; requirements so that lower-end users (and we have quite a few) 
    would lose out. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; Personally, I'm aware of some of the sacrifices we made in 
    detail so we could have diversity, and I would never change that. Diversity 
    is very important. <br>
    <br>
    sean@Turbine&gt; However, note that in most content added since we shipped, we 
    have tried for higher-end appearance. <br>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&quot;Rejoice! The Hopeslayer has been defeated 
    thanks to the efforts of the brave people of Dereth!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Xiao Long stood before the monument, running his fingers across the carven 
    names of mighty heroes... those heroes who defeated Bael'Zharon and 
    vanquished the Hopeslayer's dread influence from Dereth. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>The skies and seas 
    had already cleared; the season's first snow crunched underfoot.<br>
    <br>
    For perhaps the tenth time, Xiao Long checked the monument's names. And for 
    the tenth time, his was not among them.<br>
    <br>
    Someday, the Sho blademaster promised, he too would prove worthy enough to 
    merit such recognition.<br>
    <br>
    Already the fame of others grew high around him. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Other Sho he'd known since 
    youth, Sho who studied the School of the Arm, were talked about in excited 
    whispers, as rumors of their powerful War Magic rippled from town to town. 
    Such magic as Ilservian's Flame, Alset's Coil, and Crushing Shame.<br>
    <br>
    Xiao Long had taken a different path, dedicating himself to the profession 
    of the blade.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;His skills were true: practiced, honed. He'd once sliced 
    through the body of a Tumerok with but a single stroke of his sword.<br>
    <br>
    Sadly, in a world as fierce as Dereth, his practiced skills still felt 
    lacking. He needed greater speed, greater striking power... <br>
    <br>
    And to this end, Xiao Long had come to learn of a quest promising these very 
    things. Of course, the quest also promised many dangers: Iron Golems, idols, 
    bandit castles. But Xiao Long was not afraid.<br>
    <br>
    They will raise such a monument as this to my exploits, the Sho blademaster 
    vowed. Or else a gravestone to my memory.<br>
    <br>
    Xiao Long turned away, back to the world of Dereth. </p>

    <a name="nowinthishush"><b>NOW IN THIS HUSH</b></a><br>
    On January 9<sup>th</sup>, we launched our most recent event, &quot;<i>Now in 
    this Hush</i>.&quot;<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;Following the hard-fought victory over the dread Hopeslayer, 
    Bael'Zharon, the lands of Dereth experienced a breath of peace -- or, at 
    least, a return to a more natural order. The blood-filled clime of December 
    vanished, replaced with mild winter... to include Dereth's lively snowmen!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Along with winter came 
    highly valued skills (perhaps learned as a result of practiced battle 
    against Bael'Zharon). Mages now have access to level 7 War Magic, gained by 
    trading in level 6 scrolls at certain key locations. As a result, the 
    monsters of Dereth have learned new terror, forced to deal with such spells 
    as Icy Torment and Disintegration.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What spellcasters 
    gained in power, certain melee weapon fighters gained in wicked strikes. For 
    those looking to gain double (and even triple) strikes with daggers and 
    light swords, the Bandits' Blazing Blades quest awaits. Before daring to 
    collect the valued bandit hilts, however, be sure to study the hints and 
    help of those who've gone before. Such aid can be found at such places as

    new infusions can also be found, transforming the Sword of Lost Light into 
    the blood-dripping Sword of Lost Hope...</p>

    <b>DREAM EVENT WINNERS</b></a><br>
    The winning entries in the AC Dream Event contest have been selected:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Grand prize: Brent 
    Schmidt: &quot;<i>When the Watchful Stars Turn Round<O:P></O:P></i>&quot; </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&quot;It is said in some 
    ancient texts that when Rezarel eclipses Albarel a strange interaction 
    happens between these two moons and the mana currents of the planet. It is 
    said that during these times, echoes of those long dead can appear, some 
    conscious of their fate, while others seem to act out their dying moments or 
    worst fears. Such an eclipse hasn't been seen in millennium, but studies of 
    the skies over Dereth seem to indicate that one is coming soon.&quot;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">1<sup>st</sup> 
    Runner-up: D. Matthew Williams<O:P></O:P> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Archibald used his new powers to create both a &quot;sky 
    fortress&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; golems. He broke into a Virindi stronghold stealing 
    notes from their experiments and kidnapped creatures from Dereth's 
    landscape. The month begins with the citadel floating in the sky over Dereth, 
    as Archibald-the-Mad cackles globally, &quot;You have one month to return the 
    body of my beloved or I will destroy you all!! I have placed my creations 
    upon Dereth to show my power!!&quot;</p>

    Runner-up: Andrew Goodman<O:P></O:P> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Andrew's event begins 
    &quot;with plants all over Dereth suddenly starting to wither and die. The town 
    criers spread rumors that the Virindi have taken the shattered remains of 
    three of the Soul Crystals and, using strange machines, are attempting to 
    harness their powers. As is usually the case with the Virindi, their intent 
    remains a mystery. All that is known for certain is that the Virindis' 
    machines are sucking the life out of the world, and that regardless of their 
    intent, they must be stopped.&quot;</p>
