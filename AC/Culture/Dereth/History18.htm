      <font face="Arial" size="2">Candeth Martine, once a hero to the people of Dereth, has 
      made his first move. Beneath the cover of the winter sky, Martine and his 
      troops laid waste to all but six of the arrival points on Dereth. None 
      know what has happened to the souls that were being transported to Dereth 
      through the former arrival points, but these attacks can only be seen as a 
      declaration of war. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">High Queen Elysa Strathelar, having been informed of these 
    assaults, has dispatched her guard to reinforce the remaining six outposts 
    in the towns of Shoushi, Yaraq and Holtburg. Her efforts have produced new 
    training settlements equipped to better educate and train the new arrivals 
    from Ispar. Yet within the walls of the Training Academies all is not well. 
    Martine's forces continue their efforts at the outer edges of these schools 
    and newcomers are called upon to assist the Guards in the defense. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To assist in the war effort, experts in the use of thrown 
    weapons have developed a new device for launching uniquely crafted darts at 
    enemies. These atlatls have been distributed to vendors across Dereth in 
    hopes that they will be improved upon by savvy crafters and brought into 
    wide use by other practitioners. During the creation of these weapons, 
    experts learned also how to balance their throws while arming themselves 
    with shields. However, the atlatl's length and the balance needed to 
    maintain proper aim and strength prevent the use of shields with these new 
    weapons. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the halls of the Arcanum, Nuhmidira and her apprentices 
    continue to provide “keepers” for carpenters to place before the new houses 
    they build. Rumors spread that the Arcanum is also behind the “living” candy 
    sticks left at the town centers bestowing beneficial spells to all who pass 
    through. Their silence on the matter has not proven a deterrent in this 
    belief. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A perfected art of cobbling has yielded the creation of 
    slippers made from the carcasses of rabbits throughout Dereth. At home or on 
    the streets, these slippers can be found on the feet of travelers, a welcome 
    distraction from the threat that has so recently appeared. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Trees, lights, and logs for the fire can be purchased from 
    lumberjacks outside of several towns. Even in this dark time the festival 
    period will not be denied. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A new shadow grows over the land of Dereth. This enemy is 
    the most frightening that the people have yet faced. He was once one of 
    them, an Isparian, but the twisted machinations and magic of the Virindi 
    have driven him to a breaking point. Now, filled with hatred and rage, he 
    turns his sights on those he once considered kin. It is an uncertain future 
    and fate that the people of Dereth now face.<br>
