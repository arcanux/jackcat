      </font><img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="112" height="250"><font face="Arial" size="2">Brann Mitenset stood in the doorway of the Exploration Society Outpost of Qalaba'r, watching as the dusk slowly snuffed out the light in the room. After Sir Alayne had been murdered, Brann knew the Society would be facing some rough times. But he hadn't known just how tough it would be.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Dereth was in the midst of exciting events. Lugians opening up civilized contact with the Isparians. The expanding Virindi presence in the wake of their Ayan Baqur invasion. New variants of creatures to catalog, and new items to identify. This was a time that begged for the Society to be at its prime, to use its store of knowledge and talents to make sense of a world that grew stranger by the day.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Andoun had said as much last night, before he'd drunkenly staggered out again for another evening of debauchery and gambling. The gambling bug had also bitten Saladur hard. And Ainea still had not returned from Linvak. After what had happened with Martine, and Andoun's continued commitment to his wastrel lifestyle, Brann wondered if Ainea Besu had made the same choice he was making tonight.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      He was dawdling. Hoping . . . what? No, he knew this day would come. There were other people now to lead the fight. The fight for knowledge, the fight to form a community in the face of danger. Even if the Society did not survive in its current incarnation, there would be another coming. The need to know, to build, is what defines us, Brann thought, as he left the abandoned outpost and walked toward the moonlit hills.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      He headed toward proof that it defined others as well.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <i>Unlike any other gaming experience, the world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve. Last month, the Virindi launched their crusade against humanity, replacing the innocent townsfolk of Ayan Baqur; aiding their invasion were the eerie Dolls and Marionettes, and the deadly Virindi Executors. One can only wonder what additions -- and what dangers -- will be added when we open our April event, “A Reign of Stone.”<br>
      <br>
      Be sure to continue your part in this incredible ongoing story, and we'll see you in Dereth!&nbsp;</i>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/aprilrollout.asp">Zone</a>
    </font>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">April 17, 2001</font></p>
      <p><img alt="A Reign of Stone" src="Sorrows/img_lugian.jpg" align="right" width="137" height="181"><font face="Arial" size="2">Seemingly carved from the mountain upon
      which it resides, many have long wondered about this ponderous fortress.
      Boasting walls of impossibly thick stone, none but the Lugians could have
      built such a place. Linvak Tukal! their bass voices cry -- the ultimate
      seat of their power. Until now, only the gray-skinned giants thundered
      through its cavernous halls. &nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On April 17th, the latest event for
      Asheron's Call was launched: “A Reign of Stone.” While the Lugians are
      met in their own stronghold, the campaign against the Virindi continues
      unabated. Last month, the floating enigmas seized the town of Ayan Baqur,
      replacing its residents under the watchful eye of an elder Observer.
      Further conquests must be planned, for rumors circulate of a Virindi
      consulate reaching a hand out to the Lugian giants. Others tell of an
      underground lab infested with the twisted remains of Virindi
      experimentation. What role might the Director known as “Father” play .
      . . or the sinister Legates and Envoys?</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">In these times of terror, the immigrant
      peoples of Dereth seek new ways to lighten their mood. Such need must
      explain the recently opened houses of games (or “dens of iniquity” to
      some), where adventurers returning from a successful hunt can gamble away
      their hard-earned gains. Some have entered clutching their last trade
      note, and left with prizes such as Pyreal Nuggets and Platinum Scarabs.
      Others, more confident, less fortunate, bet all they had, only to walk
      away with but a single, rotting cabbage.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet outside these gambling dens, other
      items of incredible wealth simply wait to be gained. Intrepid souls have
      returned to town with their packs boasting Lugian armor and gems, Virindi
      magic, and a deadly trio of weapons: Bloodletter, Fleshstripper, and
      Soulrender.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps these riches of Dereth have
      inspired the newfound cooperation seen among hunting parties. Now those
      who fall in battle may elect chosen companions to help recover the losses
      of their slain bodies. A much needed agreement -- for the rites of spring
      have become more dangerous, and rewarding, than ever!</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all
      changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town
      criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades
      of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and
      abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>
      <p><span class="Head"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Highlights include:</font></b>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several new quests concerning the
          Virindi and Lugians (not to mention their weapons and spells) have
          been added.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The imposing Lugian fortress, Linvak
          Tukal, opens to the public.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gambling comes to Dereth! Those
          hard-earned pyreals can be spent in the pursuit of such prizes as
          Sturdy Iron Keys, Diamond Scarabs, and more.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players are now able to give other
          players access to their corpses (type: <i>@help permit </i>for more
          details).</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hit messages now report those body parts
          affected during melee combat. Now you can be further immersed in the
          fun of Tuskers rapping your knuckles like an irate schoolteacher.</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Further varieties of Mattekars roam the
          landscape. Mind the horns!</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A tribute has been added to the world,
          dedicated to “those who served.”</font>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monster rebalancing continues. This
          month the Gromnies fight more in accordance with their original
          design.</font></li>

	<p class="MsoNormal">Never have my humbled eyes feasted on such grandiose 
    might as that of Linvak Tukal. For many months now, I have made pilgrimage 
    to the snowy outskirts of the Lugians' stone citadel, to bask in the marvel 
    of its strength and that of its makers. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Never before have I been so struck 
    with awe at what may yet be built, rather than what the Empyrean had simply 
    left behind.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">I made this pilgrimage once more, a lone warrior come 
    to pay homage to the greatest warrior race ever known in life or legend.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Ah, 
    my friend, you could not imagine my profound astonishment to find the gates 
    of Linvak Tukal opened to our kind. With no small trepidation, I entered.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Timidly picking my way down the ponderous halls, my 
    sight was drawn, over and again, to the vastness of the ceilings.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Several 
    times, I confess, I nearly toppled over for my gawking. Within the vaults of Tukal, I was forced to acknowledge the place as nothing less than the seat 
    of Lugian power in this world. And such power they command! The citadel 
    seemed less built by mortal hands than carven from the mountaintop. A 
    massive forge channeled the elemental fires of the very heart of Auberean. I 
    cringed, I nearly fell once more, when the master Lugian smith, Ulkas, 
    deigned to acknowledge my simple presence. &quot;Greetings, soft one…&quot; his voice 
    boomed.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Not until days after I left the place 
    did it occur to me to wonder at Ulkas's gifts, my ears still hissing faintly 
    from the roar of Tukal's forge and the ringing of the master's great hammer. 
    How strange it is that the Lugians should craft works of arms and armor fit 
    for our feeble human form! Do these giants look to us as potential allies? 
    Or pawns, in some metagame played out between their noble ranks and those 
    floating deaths known as Virindi?</font></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Ah, my friend, if only I 
    knew the answer to such imponderables, I should become a sage among the 
    fellows of Zaikhal.</font> </p>

    Strength. Focus. Purity. The three totems of the Lugian race. On April 17, 
    our latest event, &quot;A Reign of Stone,&quot; opened – as did the gates to the 
    Lugian citadel, Linvak Tukal. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Once feared as little more than grunting, 
    skull-crushing giants, the Lugians appear to have reached out to the human 
    populace, perhaps seeking allies against the raiders of their own kind. For 
    those willing to take up the cause of Linvak Tukal, to recover its missing 
    totems, the Lugians offer powerful rewards of armament. A closer look at 
    their Arm, Mind, Heart quest may be found at
    <a href="Stone2.htm">Maggie the 
    Jackcat's Fabulous AC Guide</a>.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">However, as first diplomatic contact is made at Linvak 
    Tukal, the campaign continues against the Virindi – an enemy who may 
    themselves be interested in recruiting the giants' strength. Already, 
    diplomatic missives have been intercepted, and their Gredaline Consulate 
    raided. All evidence indicates further Virindi aggression against the world 
    is imminent. Of course, in addition to this captured intelligence, more 
    tangible gains have been taken from the consulate: lore and spellcraft, 
    dutifully noted on the Crossroads of Dereth compendium and <u>event pages</u>.<O:P></O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">While the brave dare the halls of Linvak Tukal, and the 
    noble further our cause against the Virindi, those of a more epicurean 
    nature have taken full advantage of the gambling halls. Chips may be 
    purchased, fortunes wagered, and opportunities to open the rich golden 
    chests won. Prizes reportedly range from crusty ends of bread, to sparkling 
    diamond scarabs, to the latest pack toy: the coveted Golden Gromnie!<O:P></O:P>
