      <img src="Sorrows/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="177"><font face="Arial" size="2">As she sat at his bedside in the dawning light, Elysa was amazed at the 
    transformation in Asheron. In the weeks following his healing, the color had 
    been slowly returning to his face. After seeing the state he had been in, 
    the pall of death hanging over him, his recovery seemed nothing short of a 
    miracle. Already his strength had returned enough for him to open the ways 
    to weaken Gaerlan's citadel. He hadn't completely healed yet; he still 
    rested more than he once had. Yet soon, she knew, he'd be at full strength.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she sat there watching Asheron sip his 
    green tea, she grinned as she called to mind something one of her council 
    members had said long ago. She didn't even remember the context--some minor 
    crisis--and Celdiseth had sighed and said in his usual sarcastic manner, 
    “Dereth is full of wonders.” Indeed, her son was one such wonder. He was 
    responsible for saving Asheron, and perhaps their people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the time she hadn't known if she should 
    praise Borelean for his bravery and selflessness, or punish him for putting 
    himself at risk as like he had. As his mother, she had always thought highly 
    of him, yet never before had she been so proud. He was becoming the man that 
    she'd always known he could be. But underlying her pride there was that 
    maternal twinge, the feeling that he was growing up combined with the gentle 
    pain of knowing he wouldn't need her forever. “Thorsten,” she thought, “he's 
    so much like you.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Noticing her grin, Asheron said, “I didn't 
    realize sipping tea was so entertaining.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa blinked, coming out of her fugue. 
    “Sorry. I was just thinking about all that has happened in the span of a few 
    weeks. It almost seems too incredible to believe.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He smiled. “Agreed. I owe my life to your 
    people. Both to young Borelean--” He paused to sip his tea and then said, 
    “and to Candeth.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What are we going to do about Martine?” she 
    shot back, an edge in her voice. “One act of altruism doesn't make up for 
    all he's done. He's threatened all of our lives and brought us to the brink 
    of disaster.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I realize that, Elysa, but I sense a change 
    in him. Candeth's mind is no longer tainted by Gaerlan's influence,” Asheron 
    said with care. “The clarity your son's actions brought to him was the seed 
    from which Candeth was able to heal his mind.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Wonderful, he's healed,” she said, biting 
    off each word. “He should be dead for what he's done to all of us. For what 
    he tried to do to you.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elysa, this calamity that your people face 
    is just another a consequence of my actions,” he said forcefully. “Need I 
    remind you of what I am responsible for?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She sat silent. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“A thousand years ago I didn't have the 
    strength to oppose the Emperor,” he continued. “I am responsible for the 
    death of Gaerlan's brother, Delacim. My supposed genius wasn't able to find 
    a way to defeat the Olthoi.” He gestured toward Elysa and said, “The portals 
    to Dereth were the result of the mad spell I cast trying to save my people. 
    Your people were enslaved by the Olthoi and died fighting their Queen.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Seeing her wince at the mention of the Olthoi 
    Queen, Asheron paused a moment before continuing more softly, “Candeth lives 
    because I healed the grievous wounds he incurred during his berserk attack 
    on a Virindi complex. If you need to blame someone for the threat that is 
    hanging over your people--” He looked into her eyes. “You should blame me.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She sat for a moment looking down at her 
    hands as they rested in her lap, and then said quietly, “You aren't 
    responsible for all those things, and I realized that long ago. You're a 
    good man.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron laid his hand on hers, “And so was 
    Candeth, once.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They sat for a moment, silent. As the silence 
    began to stretch uncomfortably, Elysa sighed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Perhaps,” she said, looking up at Asheron. 
    “But that doesn't stop the threat.” She began to speak more quickly. “The 
    combined might of my people have destroyed three of the four siphoning 
    crystals, but Gaerlan still threatens them all. And Yanshi. . . you've told 
    me you sense something wrong there.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before he could say anything, Elysa looked 
    down at her hands again and said, “Asheron, I have to go to them.” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Concern entered Asheron's eyes. “You realize 
    you'll be a target for Gaerlan, do you not? My wards are holding the force 
    of his elemental magics back from this castle for now, but I won't be able 
    to protect you if you leave it.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“That doesn't matter, I simply can't hide 
    anymore,” she said, looking up at his face intently. “I once left my people, 
    after the towns were settled. I thought they didn't need me anymore. I see 
    now that I was wrong. I was trying to escape. I tried to escape for five 
    years.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ely, I am well acquainted with bearing the 
    weight of your race's future,” Asheron said sagely. “But I cannot stress the 
    need for care enough. Do not risk yourself in this way.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before he could say anything more, she rose 
    and strode toward the door. “I'm sorry, I can't abandon them. Rest, heal, 
    regain your strength. You'll need it. I'll be back once I've spoken to my 
    people.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>To be continued. . .</i> </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">September 6, 2002</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron had not heard from Elysa 
      since her departure; had she been there, she would have noticed the lines 
      of concern around his eyes. However, she was not, and he was just 
      beginning to realize what her absence meant to him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You are concerned about her,” said the 
    masked figure across from him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Very much so, Candeth,” Asheron said as he 
    stroked his beard. “Very much so.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before Elysa's arrival, before she had 
    activated the portal device and he had summoned her into his presence, he 
    had been alone for five centuries. Recalling that time, he had difficulty 
    believing that he had kept his sanity. Throughout the long years, he'd had 
    only a few constructs, Golems and other magical servants, to keep him 
    company. Then he had offered a place in his castle for Elysa and Borelean, 
    and their presence had warmed his heart in ways he hadn't thought possible. 
    In Elysa he had found a kindred spirit, and in Borelean, a new pupil. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">His friendship with Elysa had been through 
    much in the last few months, and only recently did he feel that it had 
    returned to where it once was. Recent events had also brought about a change 
    in what was important to him. Where once he had been solely dedicated to 
    releasing his people or not compounding the crimes he had already committed, 
    he was now focused on helping Elysa's people and those many others that had 
    arrived. And while Elysa could not--or would not--see it, Candeth was one of 
    those who had needed his help. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Already, Candeth Martine was struggling to 
    make amends for what he had done. He had followed Asheron's direction on the 
    siphoning crystals, appearing before those assembled, preparing them for 
    what must come. Where once he had seemed to radiate an aura of insanity and 
    instability, he now radiated one of contrition. In many ways, Asheron and 
    Candeth were alike. Both had brought so much pain to the world, but neither 
    had realized it until much later. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Your heart is much tied to Melanay--” 
    Martine paused for a moment, taking a deep breath. “No, she is Elysa.” He 
    sighed, “My mind still occasionally betrays me. My control is still not 
    perfected.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With a faint, reassuring smile on his lips, 
    Asheron spoke, “That will come in time, Candeth. In time you may even be 
    able to shake off the Virindi trappings your body still expresses.” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The inhuman mask stared directly at Asheron. 
    “Be that as it may, it pains me to think of the anguish I have caused her.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Her forgiveness may also come in time. You 
    need only be patient.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“If the time exists, that is,” Martine said 
    quickly. “What more can I do? We can't have much time left.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Only what you have already done. Prepare 
    yourself. Your people will open the way for us to attack Gaerlan directly.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The people.” The mask turned away from 
    Asheron and stared at a torch hung on the wall. “They've done so much for 
    me. One of them found a letter I had written long ago and returned it to me. 
    It helped me break free of the state my mind was in after the truth was 
    revealed to me. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I know before, when I was. . .” Martine 
    struggled for a moment. “Different, that I fed off the people's attention. I 
    fed off their fear of me, their respect for my power. I used it to salve my 
    conscience, to block out unwelcome thoughts and memories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Even the Virindi part of my mind,” Martine 
    continued, twitching at the memory of what had been done to him. “The part 
    that was violently thrust into my mind, enjoyed it. It took pleasure in the 
    concepts and feelings that were alien to it. It is only now that I can see 
    it was pushing me further and further, just so it could gain some new 
    experience.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Martine's voice became nothing more than a 
    whisper. “I became accustomed to its presence, so much so that even after 
    the unnatural union of our two parts resulted in its death, my mind 
    generated a replacement. Why couldn't I see it? Why was Gaerlan able to 
    exploit me so easily?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Candeth.” At the mention of his name, 
    Martine turned to look at Asheron. “I have lived for over 2,500 years,” 
    Asheron said, leaning closer. “And in that time I've studied many different 
    schools of magic. In all my studies, I have yet to find a spell that will 
    send us into the past, as much as our minds want to live there.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You have healed the damage done to your soul 
    and mind. Be grateful for the chance you have been given. For so long you've 
    been the pawn of others, those who wanted to use you. You were a pawn for 
    Sir Alayne. The Virindi then transformed you into an instrument of 
    destruction. Finally, you became a tool of Gaerlan's revenge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Now, for the first time,” Asheron paused to 
    let the words sink in. “You are free.” </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">September 10, 2002</span></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra heard the stirrings in the next room 
    and pulled back her covers. The desert should have been very warm this time 
    of year, searing the sand and making comfort while sleeping a difficulty, 
    but this was no ordinary year. The wind whipped outside, and through a 
    broken slit in her window, she could see the flame creatures dancing around 
    a small prismatic stone with their acidic, lightning, and frost brethren. 
    Nearly one full cycle of the moons had passed, and still there was no 
    reprieve. Asheron and Martine had successfully divined the location of three 
    of the four crystals that siphoned power directly to Gaerlan's floating 
    fortress. The people had dispatched them, but to no avail. The Elementals 
    clung to the ground as though the very essence of the world was creating 
    them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A soft whisper-hiss snapped her out of her 
    deep thoughts. There was very little light in her hovel as the desert tended 
    to swallow the moonlight. She made her way to her landing using only the wan 
    glow cast by the forces of Elementals outside. She peeked over the banister 
    to where her houseguest slept below. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira had asked that Ciandra not let 
    anyone know she was free, and though Ciandra had been hesitant to oblige, 
    she obeyed. Nuhmudira had moved into Ciandra's home and used the downstairs 
    as a study and bedroom. Her youth and beauty had been stolen from her while 
    she'd been a prisoner in the place of forgetting, but she had regained her 
    knowledge and her power. Ciandra looked down on her now. . . and stifled a 
    cry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira looked up and saw her. She smiled, 
    and in the orange glow cast by the Elemental invaders, the smile looked like 
    that of a madman. She lowered her head and placed a hand on her guest, a 
    seven-foot tall Chomu Sclavus that had come with a delivery. Nuhmudira 
    beckoned to Ciandra as she stroked the crown of the Chomu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra staggered back from the banister and 
    looked about her room. She grabbed a sash and tied it about her waist, 
    pulling her nightshirt tight, then slipped her wand beneath the sash. She 
    trusted Nuhmudira still, but there was a Sclavus in her home, a development 
    that she would never have expected. As she made her way down the stairs, she 
    listened to Nuhmudira's words, barely audible over the sound of the wind 
    outside. They were not Roulean, nor were they any Gharu'ndim dialect. As 
    Ciandra reached the bottom stair, twenty snake-like forms turned to face her 
    in the darkness. She shrank back in shock. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Worry not, child,” Nuhmudira stated very 
    calmly. “They are my servants. It seems that my meddling with the Book--” 
    Nuhmudira broke off when she said the word and gently patted the item the 
    Sclavus had brought to her. So long had this Book absorbed her studies, 
    driving her to commit atrocities and wonders far beyond comprehension. It 
    had been both a boon and bane for the Arcanum. The members of the Arcanum 
    had thought the Book forever lost when Nuhmudira disappeared, yet here it 
    was again, returned to her by the Sclavus. Nuhmudira looked back up from the 
    Book and continued, “My meddling with the Book has awakened something within 
    them. They were my saviors in that hellish place. They have simply come to 
    return my belongings to me.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The old woman smiled again and Ciandra felt 
    her muscles relax. The Sclavus bowed to Nuhmudira, and then to Ciandra, and 
    backed out of the building into the desert night. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Come, child. You must have many questions. 
    And I have a tale to tell.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius watched as the High Queen approached. 
    Several of her guard had come to Yanshi over the past few days and told him 
    that she would soon arrive, and they had helped the devastated town wherever 
    they could. But he conferred more often with the light being that was sent 
    from Asheron. It was quizzical, highly evolved, and incredibly intelligent. 
    Antius was sometimes at a loss for the deductions that it was able to make.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Their study had been slow; Golems had to 
    remove the rubble from the entranceway of what was once the Elemental 
    Sanctum, as they could not gather information until they were within. He 
    pondered what he might say to the High Queen upon her arrival. Asheron's 
    Emissary knelt as she approached, but Antius did not. He forced himself to 
    remain standing, remembering how much she hated the fineries of being Queen. 
    His effort was marked by a knowing look on Elysa's face. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius, I assume you know why I am here?” 
    she asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes, Elysa, but. . . there have been some 
    complications.” He paused, searching her face for signs of disappointment. 
    He was met only with a look of patience. “The explosion and release of raw 
    mana destroyed the entirety of the Sanctum below us. Golems are below now 
    removing the rubble, but there can be no determinations made until we have 
    access into the lower levels. We know the chambers are there because the 
    floors sound hollow, but--” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He stopped and looked behind the Queen as a 
    force of men and women wearing the colors of the royal guard and bearing her 
    standard marched into the city. Elysa cleared her throat to get Antius back 
    to his story. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We have yet to find a way into the lower 
    levels,” he continued. “We have, however, heard the sounds of something 
    speaking, as if waking from a slumber, and there have been minor quakes in 
    the earth.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa nodded. She looked back to her forces 
    and called out to them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We need to assist Scholar Blackmoor. There 
    is a subterranean lair below what used to be the Sanctum where Gaerlan 
    worked his magic to destroy this town. We'll be assisting Asheron's Golems 
    in removing the debris to facilitate further study of this area.” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The ground shook violently, causing some to 
    lose their footing. Elysa remained a pillar of calm, and when the tremor 
    ended she turned to Antius. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Any guesses?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Something that was never meant to be. 
    Something that the Aun Tumeroks fear is more powerful than the Olthoi.” He 
    shook his head. “If you are asking me for an educated guess, Elysa, I cannot 
    give you one. Too much speculation and fear is running through my mind at 
    the moment, but. . .” He paused and leaned toward the High Queen. “I think 
    that there is something down there, growing and giving itself the very magic 
    of this world. I don't think that it can be stopped, and I worry that if it 
    succeeds in weakening magic any more than it already has, something worse 
    than the Hopeslayer could be released.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa met his eyes for a long moment and then 
    nodded. She turned back to her force and motioned them into action. They 
    descended into the pit and began assisting the Golems beneath the charred 
    landscape of Yanshi. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The air crackled around him. The ground 
    sizzled where he walked. Beads of acid flew from his hands as he furiously 
    paced his study, located in the highest reaches of his citadel's library. 
    Moisture condensed in his frozen breath and slowly floated to the floor as 
    snow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“This is inconceivable!” Gaerlan screamed to 
    the empty room. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The words echoed throughout the library, 
    “This is inconceivable. . . is inconceivable. . . inconceivable. . .” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The third crystal had fallen, destroyed by 
    the Isparian vermin. He sensed the power that it once fed him ebbing away to 
    somewhere else, to where the rituals to summon the Harbinger had failed.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The fools will be the death of the world,” 
    he cried. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Through the library, “Death of the world. . . 
    of the world. . . the world. . .” echoed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hundreds of years of effort were unraveling 
    before his eyes. When first he had found the citadel, this temple that had 
    lain dormant for centuries, he'd known that it would be the instrument of 
    his ascension. The destiny he knew he had been born to would begin here. He 
    had felt it in the pit of his being and had known he had been fated to find 
    this. Nothing could prevent his destiny, not even the prison between worlds 
    to which Asheron had condemned their people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After Martine had accidentally returned him 
    to the world, Gaerlan had been so sure--it had been so obvious--that the 
    force of history was behind him. It had all fallen into place, each piece he 
    had used. . . That fool Martine, yearning for the life he had left behind, 
    pushed further into madness. . . Nuhmudira, her unswerving loyalty to her 
    people so readily twisted into a path abhorrent even to her fellow 
    barbarians. . . The vermin's weak-willed Queen, so easy to manipulate, the 
    tool that had exposed Asheron to Martine's assault. He had masterfully 
    placed them against each other, almost as if it had been a game. His 
    revenge, his ascension. . . It had been so close, so very close. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now he would fall, the world would be 
    consumed by the magics loosed by the vermin, and Asheron would never pay for 
    his crimes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I refuse to believe it; it cannot be so!” he 
    said as he turned a corner in his pacing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It cannot be so. . . cannot be so. . . be 
    so. . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This citadel and its ancient library, 
    constructed by that cabal of undead elementalists, these had been his tools. 
    He had dedicated himself to using the magics found there, to using what 
    those abominations had created, in defense of the Cerulean Throne. Why now, 
    when his plan seemed closest to fruition, would it begin to fall apart 
    around him? How had he failed? What had he done wrong? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I did everything perfectly!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Did everything perfectly. . . everything 
    perfectly. . . perfectly. . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the magics had been born from those 
    opposed to the Throne, in his capable hands they had become a weapon in 
    defense of the Crown. They were to have been a means for him to rise to 
    prominence in the Empire. Perhaps even a means for him to lay claim to the 
    Throne! Where was the misstep? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A thought occurred to him, and he paused in 
    his frantic pacing. Perhaps Asheron was not the fool he had taken him for. 
    Could the secret of Asheron's long life, the secret Gaerlan had discovered 
    long ago, be a sign of his collusion with those who had forsaken the Light, 
    those loathsome undead? Yes, the undead were infamous for trying to 
    manipulate and control the living. Asheron was the cause of all of this!
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes! Yes! Asheron's meddling stretched back 
    even to when Gaerlan and his brother had first arrived at the Knorr Lyceum, 
    Asheron's academy for magical study. Asheron must have recognized Gaerlan's 
    innate ability and determined that he would do all he could to hamper it. 
    That was why Gaerlan's brother Delacim had been held in esteem, while 
    Gaerlan had been virtually ignored. Asheron had interfered in Gaerlan's 
    life, even using his own brother against him. And when his brother was of no 
    more use to him, Asheron had arranged for Delacim to be killed. Asheron was 
    behind all the problems that had plagued his plans, and now his corruption 
    would be the doom of the world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I am not yet defeated!” he shrieked, his 
    frozen spittle clattering on the floor. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Not yet defeated. . . yet defeated. . . 
    defeated. . .” returned the echo from the walls of the library. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He would strengthen the guard on the final 
    crystal. It would be inaccessible to all those protected by Asheron's 
    corrupting magics. Gaerlan would focus his remaining power on that location 
    and maintain it; he would resist Asheron's minions. His power would be 
    enough to wipe them off the face of Dereth. The vermin had already seen the 
    extent of his power, as his forces had plagued them for weeks. Now though, 
    with this remaining crystal, the crystal he would secure, Gaerlan would 
    scour the surface of the planet clean. The infestation, the taint brought to 
    this world by Asheron, would be gone forever. Perhaps a scrap of pity had 
    plagued him before, preventing him from using his full might against them.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He smiled to himself when he thought of how 
    future generations would remember this time. They would see it as the 
    turning point between his darkest hour and when he rose to the challenge 
    presented by the world. Yes, those future Empyreans would see this as the 
    beginning of their return to power, when their greatest leader defeated 
    Asheron and led them into a glorious future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He would not fail, nor would he fall. 
    Asheron's corruption and meddling would be defeated. He would have his 
    revenge on the man. Asheron would pay for Delacim's murder, the massacre of 
    their people, and the near destruction of the world itself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He raised his head toward the roof and 
    roared, “Asheron! I will see the vision fulfilled!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The chamber echoed for several minutes with 
    his laughter, and then was silent. </font></p>

    <br>
    Elysa thought to herself that a more unusual council meeting would have been 
    unimaginable just a few months before. Council meetings had been an 
    irregular event in the calm years before the Hopeslayer had been freed, but 
    in recent years they had become more regular as Elysa realized the 
    importance of her role among her people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After rallying the Guard and examining Yanshi, 
    she'd been able to see that Asheron was relieved at her return. For several 
    hours, they had discussed what she had seen and what was to come. He had 
    agreed that she needed to gather the council, and had set in motion the 
    necessary preparations. He'd also agreed with her decision to invite two 
    more guests to the proceedings, and had sent emissaries to them as well. 
    However, there was another decision she had made, one that she hadn't told 
    him about, one that she knew he wouldn't agree with. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Responding to the summons Asheron had 
    conveyed via his emissaries, the council members slowly filtered into the 
    room. The council was comprised of various members of Isparian society, from 
    the prominent founder of Ayan Baqur to scholars and wise archmages. Elysa 
    had positioned her high-back chair so that she could watch the members as 
    they entered. As some crossed into the room, she noticed a bewildered look 
    on their faces, especially those who had never been to Asheron's castle 
    before. On others, she saw an air of indifference. One in particular seemed 
    almost overwhelmed by the summons and the castle; it was Ciandra, who 
    represented the Arcanum and was now the youngest member of the council. She 
    had distinguished herself in the months following Nuhmudira's disappearance 
    and had become the de facto head of the Arcanum. The last to arrive was 
    Celdiseth the archmage, as usual; just another of his ways of showing that 
    position and rank meant little to him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Celdiseth took his seat, Elysa stood up 
    and opened the council. “Thank you all for coming. We have much to discuss, 
    although our time is short. In just the last hour the situation has 
    progressed and we must respond to it. However, before we begin, we have two 
    more who will be joining us.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A curious look crossed the faces of some as 
    she stated this, and a moment later the doors to the chamber swung open. 
    Gasps escaped a few lips as a towering Lugian strode into the room, followed 
    by a Tumerok from the island of Marae Lassel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa scanned the faces of the council and, 
    gesturing toward the Lugian, said, “This is Lord Kresovus of Linvak Tukal.” 
    He inclined his head as he was introduced. Directing her hand toward the 
    Tumerok, she said, “And this is Aun Hareltah of Timaru. The Lugian and 
    Tumerok people face the same doom as we. They have been invited today to 
    serve in an advisory capacity.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hareltah directed his attention toward Elysa 
    and bowed. “Thank you, Ispar Elysatah.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes, thank you, Queen,” Kresovus spoke up. 
    “Although your people still war with our brethren, it is in our best 
    interests, especially now, to work together.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Thank you for coming,” she said with a 
    smile, then turned her attention back to the council and began, “Let me 
    bring you up to date on what has happened. You are all aware that in the 
    past few weeks Asheron has divined the locations of Gaerlan's siphoning 
    crystals. Our people have been successful in shattering these crystals, 
    although with each successive assault, they find the crystal stronger and 
    more difficult to destroy.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she spoke, she surveyed the faces of the 
    council. “The last one, which Asheron discovered only a few hours ago, was 
    the most powerful and proved to be the most challenging. The intensity of 
    the energy contained there prevented our people from even entering the 
    facility where it was located. In order for our people to enter, they were 
    required to step out from under Asheron's protection. We were also 
    distressed to hear that a few misguided citizens opposed the destruction of 
    the crystal, out of fear of what might be released if it was destroyed. They 
    attacked our people and tried to hamper their efforts. However, in the end 
    our people proved successful. This crystal's destruction has weakened 
    Gaerlan, opening a way to attack him directly.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She paused for a moment and looked down at 
    the table, collecting her thoughts. She returned her attention to the 
    council members and continued, “Martine has been working alongside Asheron 
    to aid our people--” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“And what of Martine?” Celdiseth interrupted 
    loudly. “So nice of you to inform us of this now, even though I had heard 
    reports right after the first crystal was destroyed. How are we to know that 
    this isn't just another of his mad tricks? That he isn't playing us for the 
    fool?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Celdiseth,” she said slowly, turning to face 
    him. “You are well aware that I have. . . reservations about dealing with 
    Martine. Nevertheless, Asheron has assured me that Martine's intentions are 
    pure and that he is a changed man. In regard to the situation currently 
    confronting us, I have no reason not to believe Asheron. However, do not 
    think for a moment that I have forgotten all Martine has done.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Celdiseth simply snorted in response. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“As I began,” she continued, focusing her 
    attention back to the faces of the council. “Martine has been aiding our 
    people, informing them of what is to come. After the last crystal fell, he 
    created portals to a location below Gaerlan's floating citadel. Reports from 
    some of my Guard indicate that he told the crowds that he was going to face 
    Gaerlan personally.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes, a member of--” Ciandra blurted, then 
    stopped an instant as she realized the attention of the entire council was 
    upon her. “A-a-a member of the Arcanum spoke to Sir Olivier Rognath, a 
    member of the Explorer Society. Sir Olivier had known Martine before he was 
    modified by the Virindi and was in attendance when Martine spoke to the 
    crowds. Sir Olivier said that Martine appeared before them as a human. He 
    appeared as Sir Olivier originally remembered him!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Amazing,” Asheron said quietly, stroking his 
    beard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Asheron?” Elysa said, turning her attention 
    toward the man seated next to her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I knew that as his mind healed,” Asheron 
    addressed the council, “he would gain the ability to appear human once more. 
    However, I'm surprised he gained the ability so quickly. Although Elysa and 
    I differ on our feelings, I feel that Martine's mind is truly healed. I can 
    feel the sincerity in him, the enormous guilt that he feels. I feared that 
    it might move him to take this course, to confront Gaerlan. I only hope he 
    survives.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At one side of the table, the usually quiet 
    and serene archmage Shoyanen Kenchu spoke up, “I can appreciate the need to 
    bring us up to date, Your Highness,” she said, agitation clear in her voice. 
    “But you have not yet told us what we are to do. The destruction of the 
    crystals has not removed Gaerlan's elemental creatures from the land. They 
    still surround my tower, and my visitors are slaughtered as they try to 
    approach.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she continued, a tremor entered her voice. 
    “Just before I was summoned here, I witnessed a horrible murder of someone 
    new to our lands. Although they were returned to life, death still has a 
    price.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Shoyanen finished, the council broke out 
    into a chorus of voices, each clamoring for Elysa's attention, or the 
    attention of the person seated next to them. Some talked of events they had 
    witnessed, others of the course the Queen should take to rout Gaerlan. Elysa 
    tried to regain their attention, but their voices drowned her out. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Suddenly, from a corner of the room, a voice 
    cried out, “Silence!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All eyes turned to Lord Kresovus, who simply 
    said, “Among my people it is customary to respect the matriarch.” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Thank you, Lord Kresovus,” Elysa said as 
    their eyes turned back to her. “I can appreciate your concerns--all of your 
    concerns. I share them. We will act, and we will focus on the dual threats 
    that face all of our people.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she spoke, she looked directly at each 
    person in the room. “First, we need to prepare for the assault on Gaerlan. 
    We must face him and rise to the challenge that he presents. Together we 
    faced the Hopeslayer and defeated him; can we do no less with this Gaerlan? 
    Asheron has promised to provide whatever means of support he can to aid us 
    against Gaerlan.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her voice turned gravely serious. “Although 
    the destruction of the crystals has greatly weakened Gaerlan, he will be a 
    formidable force to counter. It will require the abilities of all our 
    people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Lord Kresovus and Aun Hareltah,” she said, 
    directing her attention to the two figures that stood to the side of the 
    table. “I would ask that you provide whatever support your people can to 
    help in the battle. Already your support has been invaluable, and I wanted 
    to thank you especially for helping us to try to understand the threat 
    growing below Yanshi.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scholar Asaina al-Arqis spoke up, “Is 
    this the second threat that you spoke of, your Highness? Something in Yanshi?”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And now they were coming to the decision 
    Elysa had made, the one she knew Asheron would not agree with. There was 
    nothing to be done about that now, though; it was necessary. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes, below Yanshi something is forming. Our 
    scholars feel that this thing, if left unchecked, could destroy this world.” 
    She paused to let that point sink into the minds of her listeners, then 
    continued, “However, our people should focus their attention initially on 
    Gaerlan. I will lead my Guard against the threat below Yanshi. If the 
    Mothers smile on us, the threat will be easily countered. If not, then 
    hopefully we can provide the vanguard that will lead our people to its 
    defeat.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elysa. . .” Asheron began, but was 
    interrupted by an earth-shattering rumble. He rose and quickly strode to the 
    nearby window. The sky above them was now a sheet of elemental colors, 
    flashing from green to blue to red to purple and back again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It has begun.” He turned back to face the 
    council. “Candeth is attacking Gaerlan.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa spoke, gaining the council's attention. 
    “We must hurry. Let us conclude our discussions here, then set about our 
    tasks. The fate of our people may well rest on our actions in the coming 
    hours and days.” </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The flame grows. It burns, tearing at my body 
    and mind. It builds. Focusing becomes difficult. My thoughts drift to you my 
    wife, my love. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I came home to you, Melanay, after my day. 
    More cargos have come in today, ship after endless ship emptying its hold. 
    You ask me of my day, to talk to you. What shall I tell you? That the most 
    interesting facet of my day was the discovery of a miscalculated ledger 
    sheet? My heart burns for exploration, excitement. How it burns. . . </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Alayne approaches me. Since falling 
    through that swirling maelstrom to this strange, intimidating world, I have 
    been lost, without focus. He speaks to me of a purpose on this new world. He 
    says we should set out and explore it, map its edges, and see what none of 
    our kind has seen before. This has been my fondest wish, it has been the 
    very call of my heart, but now it leaves a bitter taste. I have betrayed 
    you. I have followed my heart and lost all that it holds dear. It smolders 
    with the loss of you and little Aritta. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Mosswarts surround me, their spears 
    prodding me in the direction they want me to go. If only the overwhelming 
    fear of death didn't paralyze me. But those Lifestones, how can I trust 
    them? How can I trust devices created by a man who abandons us on this 
    blighted world? And even if they do restore life, I have seen the corpses of 
    those who have died. Even though they knew they would be returned to life, 
    their bloated faces are disfigured into masks of pain and fear. This is a 
    world of sorrow, Melanay, it blisters us all. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Master congratulates him on the control of 
    his abilities. “Who am I?” he thinks, and a voice in his mind responds, “A 
    separate part of the whole.” Master blasts a wave of pain through his mind, 
    driving those thoughts away. Master explains that soon he will be given a 
    task, and he will be a tool of the whole. He must begin to repay the whole 
    for the gifts given to him, for his abilities. His training continues and 
    the power builds within him, focusing, burning. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Later, clarity returns to me and my thoughts 
    are once more my own, though not entirely. The voice of the Virindi within 
    my mind cries out. It misses its connection to the whole, its connection to 
    the Singularity. It has lost all that it once knew. If I still had a mouth, 
    perhaps a wry smile would cross it. “Now we are very much alike, you and I,” 
    I muse. The amusement leaves soon, though, and the pain of existence 
    returns. The pain threatens to consume me, it burns within me so strongly. . 
    . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ketnan begs for his life. He is just one of 
    those I meet as I study the society our people have built on this world. 
    From some of those I meet I take what I need. Others I manipulate to suit my 
    needs. Would you be ashamed of me, Melanay? Or maybe even horrified? It 
    matters not, for I will gain the respect of this world. With respect, I can 
    control this world. I wish to wipe away its chaos and pain. I have so many, 
    many plans. I will provide gifts to our people, although they will come with 
    a price. Some of my gifts will instill the fear of death in them. Other 
    gifts will leave them questioning the nature of their existence on this 
    misbegotten world. I will show them the way and be a blazing beacon to them. 
    . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As I walk in the shadows cast by our people, 
    I find others who are as I was when I first arrived on this world. They are 
    directionless, filled with hopelessness. What kind of monster would drop 
    these people on a world of pain? I will become these outcasts' benefactor, 
    not abandoning them like that man has. They will not be torn apart by this 
    world. The sight of them stokes the fires of hate in my heart, hate for 
    Asheron. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These outcasts of society remind me of 
    something from the past. In what now seems a lifetime ago, the departed Sir 
    Alayne gave me a purpose: to explore this world. Although he is gone, his 
    mandate remains, and I will begin exploring this world, mapping its edges. I 
    find that even after all that has happened, my heart still burns for 
    understanding, for exploration. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My exploration has found other people, 
    Melanay, although they are not people. Tonk, they call themselves. They are 
    a peaceful, spiritual race living in a devastated land, a land they call 
    Palenqual. They will provide a purpose for our people. We will help these 
    Tonk free their land from the threat we have defeated. I will establish a 
    stronghold for our people to find in this plagued land. I will provide more 
    gifts for them, more direction, more insight, showing them how meaningless 
    their lives are. Perhaps I can finally quench the fire within me . . .
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am within my chambers, surrounded by my 
    people. This town has grown and prospered, all hidden from the world above. 
    I focus my mind on the final spell, the spell that will bridge the gap that 
    separates the Tonk and our people. Tremendous energies build within me. I 
    begin to weave the tendrils of energy into the portals our people will use. 
    As I complete the spell, I sense a host of minds around me. Intrigued--for I 
    still consider myself an explorer--I send forth my mind toward them, but I 
    find myself rebounding off a barrier. Could this be the Singularity, 
    protecting itself from attack? I focus on one mind, a mind consumed with 
    rage and anger. Perhaps this is Master, or Overseer, or one of the others 
    who had tortured me, who had turned me into something else. Again and again, 
    I strike out at that point, trying to pierce the barrier. Torrents of pain 
    rain down my body. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I awake, finding myself on the floor. As I 
    stand upright, I see the form of a man struggling to his knees. . . but he 
    is not a man. He is an Empyrean. Another deceiver, another liar. He has 
    appeared among my people to mislead them, to scar them like I have been 
    scarred. Power wells up within me, my hands crackle with energy. . . Then he 
    speaks. He begs. He pleads. He is rather pitiful, actually. It is obvious to 
    me now: He recognizes my power, he sees that it is greater than anything 
    ever wielded by his own people. Yet he claims to have a means to destroy 
    Asheron, and I listen. He fuels the fires of hatred. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Confusion. At times you are with me, Melanay, 
    but other times Asheron keeps us apart. How did you come to be on this 
    world, or are you still back on Ispar? The moment has come; I will finally 
    accomplish what I had set out to do. I am gaining the respect of the world 
    and it will be mine to make right. The firestorm within me burns. I make the 
    final move and unleash the rage and pain at the man responsible, I unleash 
    it on Asheron. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the truth comes, and I see that the fire 
    has consumed me entirely. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is my memories of you, Melanay, and the 
    actions of a brave child, a child so much like our own, that ignite a new 
    fire in me. The old passions and desires have been turned to ash and blown 
    away. I burn brightly now, my love, yet instead of consuming me, the fire 
    makes me stronger, it makes me the man I once was. . . and more. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This fire will burn up all the wrongs I have 
    committed. I will use it to destroy the disease I have brought to this 
    world. The fire burns. It is blinding, Melanay, burning brighter and 
    brighter. It is burning up the pain, the confusion. It consumes it all. It 
    burns and burns. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Until. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">. . . only you and Aritta are left. </font>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As discussed in the
      <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0902.asp" style="color: #FFFFCC">
      Letter to the Players</a>, if you find duplicate hooks or chests in your 
      home, please remove all items from these immediately to prevent item loss. 
      After you leave the area and the server resets your home, the duplicates 
      should no longer be present and you can safely use your hooks for storage 
      again. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have revised the types and levels of 
      enchantments that can be found on various pieces of armor and weapons.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have tweaked the rate at which certain 
      weapons appear as treasure, as well as the racial restrictions applied to 
      these weapons, to be more inline with their skill point costs. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Certain thrown weapons--such as throwing 
      axes, clubs, daggers, djarids, darts, javelins, and shokens--will no 
      longer appear as treasure. Worry not, though! The multitude of players who 
      use these items will still be able to find a selection of such weapons on 
      sale at the 9 Nexus town bowyers. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Granite and Ceramic should now appear 
      slightly more often in higher quality treasure. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Examining stacks of salvaged Black Opal, 
      Fire Opal, and Sunstone will provide a better description of the effect 
      they add to an item, instead of just providing the name of the effect.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Chests that require a Sturdy Iron Key to 
      open should now provide slightly better treasure. Chests that provide 
      level 7 scrolls, and require a Sturdy Iron Key, are unaffected by this 
      change. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Arcanum has continued to work out the 
      last few kinks in the Isparian Arms. The Isparian Atlatl now has the 
      correct description, while the Shimmering Isparian Crossbow has been 
      assigned the correct slayer property. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Agents of the Arcanum have recovered 
      from their temporary amnesia and should now be helping you again on 
      several Arcanum quests, such as “Nuhmudira's Boon.” </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We had designed various Elemental 
      creatures so that they could spend the experience they received from 
      resisting and evading attacks. The assaults on Gaerlan have affected these 
      creatures, and they are no longer spending the experience they receive on 
      their skills or attributes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It has been possible to find gems that 
      cannot be salvaged (because they have not been mutated by the treasure 
      system) as treasure. These gems would appear as though they could be 
      salvaged; however, when the Ust attempted to salvage these items, it would 
      generate an error. The Ust has been given an upgrade so that it will 
      recognize these items as being unsalvageable. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have made a further upgrade to the Ust. 
      Double-clicking an item in the Salvage panel will now remove it from the 
      panel, and the “Salvage” button has been moved to the right-hand side of 
      the panel. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The animations and sounds from double- and 
      triple-striking just weren't cool enough, so we tweaked them slightly. 
      Thrill at the enhanced swinging action! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In the distant past, when the Virindi 
      Director was a unique creature only to be found in the Disaster Maze, he 
      was assigned a unique treasure profile. However, due to the abundance of 
      Directors now found in game, we have removed that unique profile and 
      assigned them a better treasure profile. </font></li>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">September is another exciting month for 
    players of <i>Asheron's Call</i>! Here is a summary of the changes and 
    additions for September. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Greetings fellow adventurers! I'm Tim Holman, 
    the new <i>Asheron's Call </i>Producer. I've taken over for Ken Troop, who 
    has moved on to <i>Asheron's Call 2 </i>and is pouring his high level of 
    talent into the upcoming release. Being a player of <i>Asheron's Call </i>
    for over two years, I'm very excited to join the talented and dedicated 
    teams at Turbine and Microsoft. In continuing the tradition of fresh and 
    exciting content delivered each month, I'm very proud of what the team has 
    created for you in September. Most changes this month are pure content, and 
    while I won't spoil it for you here, let me assure you that September brings 
    danger to Dereth that threatens the very existence of all life! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'd also like to take this opportunity to 
    invite you all to check out two new <i>AC </i>forums. The first,
    <a href="http://www.accmty.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    http://www.accmty.com/ </a>, is where you can find official news on the 
    state of the code and the state of the network. The second, at
    <a href="http://forums.turbinegames.com" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    http://forums.turbinegames.com</a>, has been established as a place to ask 
    the odd question, share tales of heroics, and connect with your fellow <i>AC
    </i>players in a friendly environment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before I address some of the changes that 
    have been made, I'd like every player to read the following: </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Doubled Hooks/Storage--VERY IMPORTANT!!! </b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    As you know, we have had an issue with duplicated housing objects--hooks, 
    storage chests, and covenant crystals--off and on for several months. In 
    certain server conditions, it is possible for your housing objects to be 
    doubled or even tripled, leaving you the proud owner of two or more 
    identical copies of your hooks or storage. These copies are confusing, often 
    do not behave correctly, and carry the risk of item loss. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In our continuing effort to deal with this 
    problem, we are introducing new code this month that will both lessen the 
    incidence of doubled house objects and help correct the situation if it 
    occurs. However, because there is some small risk associated with this 
    situation, we want homeowners to be aware of the following: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you find multiple copies of your housing 
    objects--especially your hooks and storage chests--in your residence, please 
    remove all items from the hooks/chests and let the house reset. Once you are 
    back to one copy of each hook/chest, they are safe to use again. IF YOU DO 
    NOT DO THIS, YOU RUN THE RISK OF LOSING YOUR STORED ITEMS. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do I tell if I have doubled hooks/chests? </b>
    </span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    You can determine if you have doubled housing objects by using the [ and ] 
    keys on your keyboard to select the items near you. If you have two or more 
    storage chests, for instance, you will be able to flip between selecting 
    both chests by using the [ and ] keys, even though you can only see one 
    chest and select one chest with the mouse. Once you have selected one of the 
    doubled housing objects with the keyboard, use the R key to open the object 
    so that you can remove the contents. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do I let my house reset? </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    In order for a house to reset, the landblock containing the house needs to 
    be empty of all players for about 10 minutes. You can tell if the house has 
    successfully reset because it will no longer have multiple copies of its 
    housing objects. At that point, it is safe to return your items to their 
    places in your hooks or chests. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What if I'm not around when my hooks and storage 
    doubles? Will I lose everything? </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The primary risk of item loss from doubled housing objects occurs when you 
    are transferring items to and from your hooks/chests while they are doubled. 
    If you are not around to access your storage, then the risk of losing items 
    due to doubled housing objects is very small. Get into the habit of checking 
    for doubled hooks/chests whenever you are transferring items to and from 
    your storage, and you should be fine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, on to some of the other changes this 
    month: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Residential Quarters: </b>This month, 
    we've added new Residential Quarters to Dereth. We're continuing to make 
    improvements to lag in these areas and to resolve storage issues. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Elemental Spawns: </b>The tide of the 
    invasion has changed and the elementals have been driven deep into Dereth. 
    Players will find that Dereth is still a very dangerous land, but the threat 
    of last month has been abated. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hollow Missile Weapons: </b>Unfortunately, 
    these did not make it into the update this month. Despite our best efforts, 
    we were not happy with the results at the time of code freeze and decided it 
    best that we hold off. Direct all hate mail to me. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Creature Spells on Armor: </b>We have 
    altered what spells can appear on what pieces of armor. It should be a bit 
    easier to get full coverage of Creature Spells on loot armor. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>The Future </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <br>
    This month's event is promising to be one of our biggest yet, providing 
    players with quests and content unlike any seen before in <i>Asheron's Call</i>. 
    We'll see you next month, and thanks for playing!<br>

      <br>
      This is the latest installment of a frequently updated series of reports 
      on The State of the Code for Asheron's Call. In this report, we keep 
      players informed as to the state of some of the more technical aspects of 
      AC, particularly bugs we are working on and technical limitations of which 
      you should be aware. Look at the News page on the Zone for other articles 
      about recent additions and changes to Asheron's Call. <br>
      <br>
      Warning: On Purchasing Mansions and Villas in September <br>
      We have discovered an issue with purchasing Mansions and Villas in this 
      event. If you purchase a Mansion or Villa while the dungeon area of the 
      house is not loaded into the world, the hooks and storage chests in the 
      dungeon will not be informed that you are their new owner. Therefore, you 
      will not be able to access any of the hooks or storage chests in the 
      dungeon area of your new home. If the dungeon area of the house is loaded 
      into the world when ownership changes, however, all of the hooks and 
      storage chests are updated in the normal fashion. <br>
      <br>
      For this reason, if you are purchasing a Mansion or Villa this month, 
      please ask a friend to stand in the dungeon area while you complete the 
      purchase. This forces the dungeon area to remain loaded, and thus the 
      hooks and storage chests are updated properly. <br>
      <br>
      This issue will be resolved with the next monthly update. At that time, 
      all of the affected dungeon hooks and chests will have their ownership 
      automatically updated and will once again be accessible. Alternatively, a 
      Mansion or Villa owner with this problem may choose to abandon their house 
      and then re-purchase it while the dungeon is loaded. If you choose to do 
      this, make certain that the dungeon area remains loaded by stationing a 
      friend in the dungeon during this process. </font></p>

      to yet another Asheron’s Call dev chat. Hopefully you’ve been enjoying the 
      September event, next month’s is shaping up to be quite interesting. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says</font>: We’ll field as many 
      questions as we can in the time that we have. Ken Karl unfortunately will 
      not be joining us tonight, but with me here are Sandra (bounty hunter

      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> So, without further 
      babbling from some producer type, let’s see the first question! <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> Btw, I seem to be having a 
      problem of getting kicked out and then having to come back in, so if I cut 
      off in the middle of a sentence, that’s the reason <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Callador in AsheronsCall asks</font>: What will you 
      do about the ability to get in to the cit by jumping through the mountain 
      surrounding it? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> It wasn't intended, but it 
      didn't ruin things, so we decided to leave it alone for this month. But 
      we'll be fixing it next month. <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Damuell in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Are we going to 
      see any changes to the way Magic Tinkering works? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>We have no plans at this 
      time to change the mechanics of magic item imbuing. We do, however, have 
      plans to introduce other magic item tinkering effects that use the 
      'standard' tinkering mechanics (rather than the imbuing mechanics). <br>

      nothing done with the worlds that defended the last cistern? it looked 
      like it was totally ignored <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>We had plans to do 
      something for those worlds that had successfully defended the cores. But 
      now that all of the worlds have defeated the crystal cores it shall 
      forever remain a mystery. <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Thrust5000 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Now that 
      hilted weapons arn't the best of the best, will we see the timer on them 
      lowered? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> At this point there are 
      no plans to adjust the timer on the hilted weapons. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>There are also no plans 
      to remove triple strike dagger or double strike swords from the game. We 
      are still considering an increase in the skill required to utilize the 
      triple strike to bring them more in line with the other weapons. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> We will let you know when 
      and if those changes come to be. <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">DaMuleBoyz in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Are there 
      any plans to revisit life magic and do something about Drain Stamina and 
      Mana which now are sadly lacking and left mages in a bad place? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>We have no plans at this 
      time to revisit the life magic changes. We may continue to do some minor 
      tweaking, but overall we are satisfied with the effects of the changes. </font></p>

      AsheronsCall asks:</font> Did you really intend for Arc spells to move as 
      fast as streaks and do full level 7 war damage? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Yes, the arcs are working 
      exactly as intended. We decided that instead of further increases to the 
      power of war spells we'd just make it easier to hit your target instead.
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> The DoT of war magic is 
      very respectable, but only if you can actually hit things. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> I do wish that I could 
      have convinced our physics code to make the spell arc higher than they 
      currently do, though. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> One other thing that many 
      folks have thought was a bug are the spell words. They are intentionally 
      the same as the old war spells to add some spice to PvP combat, again to 
      make it easier to hit your target. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Not knowing what's coming 
      at you means there is no &quot;always best&quot; dodging method, although both 
      spells can be dodged using the right tactics. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ghoti42 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> How long have 
      you guys been working on this newest quest. GREAT job btw <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>This quest took us last 
      month. The team really pulled together and made this one of the most fun 
      quests to develop and we hope you found it one of the most fun to play.

      <font color="#FFFF99">Atticus30 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Hollow 
      Arrows, when? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> Hollow arrows were not 
      included in this month's update for the reasons stated - we weren't happy 
      with their balance and decided to wait until we were. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says: </font>This is the main reason we 
      don't promise content on certain dates, as if we are not 100% satisfied, 
      it won't go out. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> Believe me, my archer is 
      eagerly waiting as well! <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">wburgess in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Are the two 
      staves and the Shield the only variable rewards available from the Gaerlan 
      quest? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>The reward chest is not 
      broken it is functioning as designed. In fact I would say that it will 
      take players at least 6 weeks to discover all the rewards. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">CloseHealer in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Do you plan 
      to update the starter quest? Lore wise <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>Yes, though it will be a 
      matter of time available to revisit the lore aspect of the quest. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">ShinsFortress in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Any 
      chance of Mana Conversion love? (I know it's useful, but I'm an old 
      &quot;loyal&quot; char that &quot;can't&quot; re-roll. ) <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>We haven't forgotten 
      about mana conversion. <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">kbartrum in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Why was 
      nothing done about the wall-climbing to get the Martine items? One would 
      assume that this was not intended. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> When we found that the 
      citadel was climbable we talked about whether it had an impact on the 
      quest as a whole and we decided that the only thing that it truly impacted 
      was the players that did not get the full effect of going through the 
      quest as a whole. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>At this time we have no 
      plans to punish any players that used this path to obtain the items. The 
      other players will be attaining the awards through the means as originally 
      designed. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MongrelGuts in AsheronsCall asks: </font>When will 
      we see Prismatic Peas? For a mage to carry enough tapers to hunt for any 
      reasonable amout of time, he has to carry far more burden than he did 
      under the old component system. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> We aren't currently 
      planning to introduce Prismatic Peas, we're happy with the length of time 
      mages can stay in the field using this new system. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ol_Dogg in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Whats going on 
      with that harbinger monster? Did he die with Gaerlan? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Wait and see. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">peebee929 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Any plans on 
      making Isparian weapons muleable? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> We've been looking into 
      various options for allowing players to mule and hook all sorts of no-drop 
      items. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> With luck, you'll begin 
      to see some of these options soon. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">acdtdude in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Can we expect 
      to see more quests like Gaerlan in the future? Like will each month be on 
      this scale? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>: dies from exhuastion
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> We strive to make each 
      month exciting, however not every month will contain something like 
      Gaerlan. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> *runs screaming* <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">romside in AsheronsCall asks:</font> I really don't 
      want to come into work and see Orion sleeping on the couch again <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Keth_Turbine says:</font> oops <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> It's very time consuming 
      (as seen in Todd dropping but we do try <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">ReinMaster in AsheronsCall asks: </font>I seem to 
      have lost romside's question, essentially it was how long was the quest 
      timer on Gaerlan's quest <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> The timer is for a full 
      cycle of days. This roughly translates into 7 days. And give Keth a break 
      the client is giving him an anuerism. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">KahlansMom in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Are your 
      plans to have more of the riddles and traps involved in more dungeons. I 
      loved everything this month. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>We are very excited about 
      being able to introduce new tech such as this. So you can be assured that 
      this is not the only time you will see such quests or dynamics. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">gollumone in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Are there any 
      plans to update the look of any more monsters. I.E. Banderlings <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> Yes. We like to do that 
      every now and then, and there is one in the hopper waiting to get out. <br>

      is AC locking up when we ALT Tab <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>We are aware of some 
      problems this month when people Alt-Tab away from the client. We will 
      continue to investigate this problem and see if we can figure out what's 
      going on. <br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">TwinklyCoyote4 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will it 
      be possible to dye covenant armor? With the number of shades (espacially 
      rare ones like pink or bright red) it is hard to get a matching suit made
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> We are working on 
      extending Derethian dyeing technology to a number of new items. It is 
      likely that Covenant Armor will be included in that list. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">JarJarBinksII in AsheronsCall asks:</font> What is 
      that human looking figure in a red shirt and black pants from the 
      portal.dat from this month? Someone on a message board said that it's a 
      turbine employee? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> That could be your worst 
      nightmare. In fact it just MIGHT be. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Rean_Slayter in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Cast Heart 
      Seeker on Missile Weapons...any effect? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> It wastes mana ... <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>Sorry to be blunt. *grin* 
      No, as we stated in a Letter to the Player a few months ago, Heart Seeker 
      and similar attack skill modifiers on missile weapons does not and never 
      has helped you hit your target. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">duckonthehunt in AsheronsCall asks: </font>What 
      happen to Martine? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>What happened to Martine? 
      That's a good question. How would you answer it? <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">ddrrds in AsheronsCall asks:</font> based on the 
      most recent Gaerlan quest, I plan on extending my stay in AC1, i still 
      believe its the best game on the market, can we expect more quests of the 
      same epic nature? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> The future is still very 
      bright, the only thing that i can say is that the amount of work that goes 
      into a patch like this is staggering. We would like to, that is for 
      certain. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Marshall_ in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will the 
      Gaerlan quest/event be permenent or end at the next patch ? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>Yes. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>The quest is going to 
      become permanent. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>Again we have plans to 
      remove the landscape access to the area, which will restore the quest to 
      the way that it was originally intended. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">henrys in AsheronsCall asks:</font> So are Lugian 
      and Tumeroks are friends now ? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> I think that you can 
      surmise that things are looking up here. But remember you've been out 
      there for a good long time killing them so the process may well be slow 
      and filled with a few bumps along the way. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">UBJK_Rjmig88 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Can we 
      have new dye colors such as orange and pink? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says: </font>Adding new dye colors is a 
      huge, gargantuan task that requires going back over every single thing you 
      can wield or wear and adding data to it. With such a tremendous effort 
      required, it is unlikely you will get more dye colors. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> However, pink and orange 
      are freely available now, by failing to dye things. So if you are really 
      bad at it, you will get those two colors. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">OptimShi in AsheronsCall asks: </font>With October 
      just around the corner, will the tradition of the past two years continue 
      and we'll have more fun masks to play with? (Like a Squid Mask!) <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> October has always been a 
      &quot;fun&quot; month. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> Do squid even HAVE faces?
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Crovax_X in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Anyway you 
      could make a bow/crossbow/atlatl with a cool effect on it? 
      Wands/staffs/orbs and melees all have cool effects on there weapons, give 
      missle some graphical love! <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> Sure, it's possible, but 
      it's unlikely you'll get flame, lightning, etc, effects on it like you 
      would with melee weapons because the damage type is inherent to the ammo, 
      not the weapon, so it may not make sense to do those. Others, however, 
      sure. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> If the design calls for 
      it. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">AC_DM_Freak in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Was the 
      fact that the Gaerlan war staff does not have Moderate War Apptitude a 
      bug? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Yes. This is a bug and 
      the item will be upgraded for the next patch. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">KahlansMom in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Is there any 
      chance of Weapons like the Silifi of Crimson Stars getting an upgrade to 
      make them more like the weapon damage of today? <br>

      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">ChillyCibbe in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Does War 
      eco really work as its supposed? With 360 base war i dont hit any harder 
      then a guy with 300 base it seems<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> First of all, there is no 
      more War Economy, it was removed. The skill based damage bonuses seem to 
      be working correctly though.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>The maximum bonus a spell 
      can receive is determined by the level of the spell though, so two high 
      level mages casting level 3 spells might be doing exactly the same damage.<br>

      </a>Double Hooks/Storage VERY IMPORTANT - </font></b></span><font face="Arial"><small>From 
    the Zone</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">September 11, 2002</font></b><font size="2">
      </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In September's patch, we will be introducing 
    code to eliminate the issue of doubled storage hooks and chests. Below you 
    will find instructions on what to do if you encounter double storage hooks 
    and chests after the patch. Prior to the patch, it is advised that you 
    remove all duplicate storage hooks and chests. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As you know, we have had an issue with 
    duplicated housing objects--hooks, storage chests, and covenant 
    crystals--off and on for several months. In certain server conditions, it is 
    possible for your housing objects to be doubled or even tripled, leaving you 
    the proud owner of two or more identical copies of your hooks or storage. 
    These copies are confusing, often do not behave correctly, and carry the 
    risk of item loss. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In our continuing effort to deal with this 
    problem, we are introducing new code this month that will both lessen the 
    incidence of doubled house objects and help correct the situation if it 
    occurs. However, because there is some small risk associated with this 
    situation, we want homeowners to be aware of the following: </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you find multiple copies of your housing 
    objects--especially your hooks and storage chests--in your residence, please 
    remove all items from the hooks/chests and let the house reset. Once you are 
    back to one copy of each hook/chest, they are safe to use again. IF YOU DO 
    NOT DO THIS YOU RUN THE RISK OF LOSING YOUR STORED ITEMS. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do I tell if I have doubled hooks/chests? </b>
    </span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    You can determine if you have doubled housing objects by using the [ and ] 
    keys on your keyboard to select the items near you. If you have two or more 
    storage chests, for instance, you will be able to flip between selecting 
    both chests using the [ and ] keys even though you can only see one chest 
    and select one chest with the mouse. Once you have selected one of the 
    doubled housing objects with the keyboard, use the R key to open the object 
    so that you can remove the contents. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do I let my house reset? </b></span>
    <font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    In order for a house to reset, the landblock containing the house needs to 
    be empty of all players for about 10 minutes. You can tell if the house has 
    successfully reset because it will no longer have multiple copies of its 
    housing objects. At that point, it is safe to return your items to their 
    place in your hooks or chests. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What if I'm not around when my hooks and storage 
    doubles? Will I lose everything? </b></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    The primary risk of item loss from doubled housing objects occurs when you 
    are transferring items to and from your hooks/chests while they are doubled. 
    If you are not around to be accessing your storage, then the risk of losing 
    items due to doubled housing objects is vanishingly small. So get in the 
    habit of checking for doubled hooks/chests whenever you are transferring 
    items to and from your storage, and you should be fine.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">As she sat at his bedside in the dawning light, Elysa 
	was amazed at the transformation in Asheron. In the weeks following his 
	healing, the color had been slowly returning to his face.&nbsp; After seeing 
	the state he had been in, the pall of death hanging over him, his recovery 
	seemed nothing short of a miracle.&nbsp; Already his strength had returned 
	enough for him to open the ways to weaken Gaerlan's citadel. He hadn't 
	completely healed yet; he still rested more than he once had.&nbsp; Yet 
	soon, she knew, he'd be at full strength.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">As she sat there watching Asheron sip his green tea, 
	she grinned as she called to mind something one of her council members had 
	said long ago. She didn't even remember the context--some minor crisis--and 
	Celdiseth had sighed and said in his usual sarcastic manner, &quot;Dereth is full 
	of wonders.&quot; Indeed, her son was one such wonder. He was responsible for 
	saving Asheron, and perhaps their people.</p>

	STORY OF SEPTEMBER</span><br>
	The latest event, Verdict, presented one of the fiercest challenges yet to 
	the world of Dereth. The epic saga included such key figures as Candeth 
	Martine, Elysa Strathelar, and Asheron himself, all aiding in the struggle 
	against the powerful sorcerer Gaerlan. As important as the event is the 
	background story, told in chapters throughout recent weeks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/171">Part 1</a>: 
		Elysa was amazed at the transformation in Asheron. He hadn't completely 
		healed, but soon would. But the threat presented by Gaerlan still loomed 
		over them all… </li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/175">Part 2</a>: 
		Asheron had not heard from Elysa since her departure. Had she been 
		there, she would have noticed the lines of concern around his eyes. 
		However, she was not, and he was just beginning to realize what her 
		absence meant. </li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/176">Part 3</a>: 
		Ciandra heard the stirrings in the next room and pulled back her covers. 
		The desert should have been very warm this time of year, but this was no 
		ordinary year. A soft whisper-hiss snapped her out of her deep thoughts…
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/177">Part 4</a>: The 
		air crackled around him. The ground sizzled where he walked. Beads of 
		acid flew from his hands. Moisture condensed in his frozen breath and 
		slowly floated to the floor as snow. </li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/178">Part 5</a>: 
		Elysa thought to herself that a more unusual council meeting would have 
		been unimaginable just a few months before. </li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<a target="_blank" href="http://g.msn.com/0NL33946/172">Part 6</a>: Two 
		men meet on a floating fortress. Neither is human. One was once a man, 
		but is now a twisted fusion of man and Virindi. The other is an 
		Empyrean, possessing vast elemental powers. </li>

      <a target="_blank" href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/skills1002.htm">Zone</a></small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">October 3, 2002</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Skill Level Changes</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While this change will not go into place 
    until patch day, we wanted to inform players of this very important change 
    as soon as possible in order to allow you to make more well-informed 
    decisions. Some recent changes to our internal systems have resulted in two 
    changes involving skill levels that will occur with the next update. This 
    letter explains these changes in excruciating detail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, some background. The level of a skill 
    is made up of three different parts: the part that comes from your 
    attributes, the part that comes from the experience points you have invested 
    into the skill, and the 'free' points that get added in on top of the other 
    two parts. Note that the part from experience points includes both 
    proficiency points earned by using the skill, character points that you 
    spent on the skill, and some quest rewards (such as from turning in tessera). 
    Also note that we have never previously used the third category, the 'free' 
    points.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Specialization Bonus</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the next update, we are changing the 
    nature of the bonus that you get when specializing a skill at character 
    creation. This change will be retroactive - that is, it will apply to all 
    existing characters with specialized skills as well as new characters 
    created after the update. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously, when you specialized a skill at 
    creation, you were awarded 671 free experience points into that skill. That 
    experience gave you 10 levels worth of skill, but it also increased the 
    experience cost of the next skill level. After the update, you will not 
    receive any free experience for a specialized skill, but you will instead 
    receive 10 'free' levels of that skill. These levels are added onto the 
    levels from your attributes and the levels from invested experience, and 
    therefore do not affect the cost of your next skill level. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Existing characters that have specialized 
    skills will lose 671 experience points from that skill - the 671 experience 
    points that they were given at creation - but will receive in exchange the 
    same 10 'free' levels that new characters receive. Note that losing 671 
    experience points may drop your skill level one or more levels, so that you 
    may not immediately be a full 10 levels higher in a specialized skill. 
    Investing 671 more experience points into the skill, however, will make up 
    this difference.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that this change only applied to 
    specialized skills. There is no change to the nature of the bonus you get 
    when training a skill at creation. Training a skill at creation has 
    previously and will continue to give you 526 free experience points in that 
    skill, which is enough experience to purchase the first 5 levels of your 
    skill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Regarding Quest Skill Experience 
    Rewards</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As mentioned above, quests that reward you 
    skill points - like the tessera and the Scroll of Dark Rain - actually 
    increase the level of invested experience in your skill. Because of a flaw 
    in the experience system, it used to be possible to use the rewards from 
    certain quests to raise the level of a specialized skill above the maximum 
    normal level. That is, you could invest experience points in the skill until 
    it was at its maximum level from experience, and then turn in tessera to 
    raise the skill another 1-5 levels. If you tried to accomplish this same 
    goal with a trained skill, however, you would still use up the tessera, but 
    you would receive no lasting benefit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This behavior was never intended. And recent 
    changes to the internal structure of the experience system no longer allow 
    this behavior. From now on, trained and specialized skill will behave the 
    same way with respect to tessera - if you have already invested the maximum 
    experience possible into the skill, then quest rewards like the tessera or 
    the Scroll of Dark Rain will not benefit you in any way. We strongly 
    recommend, therefore, that you do <strong>not </strong>attempt to receive a 
    quest reward for a skill in which you already invested the maximum amount of 
    experience. Indeed, we have always recommended that you do attempt to 
    receive a quest reward for a skill in which you already invested the maximum 
    amount of experience. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters who have already used quest 
      rewards to raise the level of a specialized skill above the normal maximum 
      will lose the excess levels of that skill with the next update. For 
      example, let's say that Bob has invested experience to get his war magic 
      skill to 223. (Note that we are only talking about the part of his skill 
      level that comes from experience here, and ignoring the part from 
      attributes.) Then he turned in 5 war magic tessera. His war magic skill is 
      now 2 levels above the normal maximum from experience, or 228. After the 
      update, Bob's war skill will lose those 2 excess levels, and his war magic 
      skill from experience will be 226. Of course, since Bob has war magic 
      specialized - and we know that he must, or he wouldn't have been able to 
      get those excess points from tessera - he also receives the 10 free levels 
      for having the skill specialized. Overall, his war magic goes up 8 
      levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm not surprised that you are confused. I 
      think a lot of people are. To be honest, it's a confusing topic. I've 
      heard several people comment that the Letter to the Players that we posted 
      on the subject wasn't terribly clear. I'm afraid that's my fault -- after 
      I spent hours trying to explain to our writer what the changes meant and 
      what people need to know from the Letter, he gave up and gave the task to 
      me. *grin* I understand what the code is doing, but it's not an easy thing 
      to express to others sometimes. But I will do my best, and you can tell me 
      if I am being utterly incomprehensible.<br>
      <br>
      So, the short form, which applies to almost all players:<br>
      Your trained skills will not change in any way.<br>
      Your specialized skills will lose 671 experience, and gain 10 levels. <br>
      These new levels do not increase the experience cost of the next level of 
      the skill.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example #1:<br>
      </b><br>
      Let's say you currently have a specialized sword skill of 225. <br>
      Let's say that your strength and coordination are both 150, so the part of 
      your sword skill that comes from attributes is 100. <br>
      That means that 125 levels of your sword skill comes from the experience 
      that you have invested into it, either by swinging your sword and earning 
      proficiency points, or by spending your available character points on your 
      sword skill.<br>
      So, checking my handy experience tables, that means that you have invested 
      somewhere between 2,368,266 and 2,497,430 experience into your sword 
      skill. (If you just spend character points on the skill, it will be 
      exactly 2,368,266, but if you've been earning experience by swinging your 
      sword, then it could be higher.)<br>
      Let's say that you have actually invested 2,400,000 experience into your 
      sword skill. You are thus 97,430 experience away from having a sword skill 
      of 226.<br>
      Summary: Your sword skill is 225 and costs 97,430 to raise.<br>
      <br>
      Now, the update happens.<br>
      You lose 671 experience from your sword skill. You now have 2,399,329 
      experience invested into your skill (2,400,000 - 671). This still equates 
      to 125 levels that comes from your experience, and you now need 98,101 
      (97,430 + 671) experience to buy the next point of sword.<br>
      Of course, you still have 100 levels of skill coming from your attributes.<br>
      And in addition, you now have 10 free levels that are tacked onto the top.
      <br>
      Summary:Your sword skill is now 235 and costs 98,101 to raise.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example #2:<br>
      </b><br>
      Let's say that everything is the same as the above example, except that 
      you have a little less experience invested in your sword skill. This time, 
      let's say that you have exactly 2,368,266 experience in your sword skill, 
      which is just enough to give you 125 levels of sword from experience. So 
      you need 129,164 experience to raise your sword skill a level.<br>
      Summary: Your sword skill is 225 and costs 129,164 to raise.<br>
      <br>
      Now the update happens. <br>
      You lose 671 experience from your sword skill. You now have 2,367,595 
      experience invested in your sword skill (2,368,266 - 671). This equates to 
      124 levels from experience, so you have lost a level. It only costs you 
      671 experience to get back to the level you were at, however, and the cost 
      of the level after that has not changed.<br>
      In addition, you now have 10 free levels of skill tacked onto the top. <br>
      Summary: Your sword skill is 234 and costs 671 to raise. The point after 
      that -- to get to 235 -- will cost 129,164.<br>
      <br>
      Simple, right? *grin*<br>
      <br>
      Now, you'll notice that I said that this is how it will happen for almost 
      all players. For a small number of players, this process is a little more 
      complicated. If in the past you had packed a specialized skill full of 
      experience until it wouldn't hold any more -- which means investing 4.2 
      billion experience, more or less -- and *then* you turned in a tessera or 
      a Scroll of Dark Rain for that skill, you would have accumulated excess 
      skill levels (because of a bug in the experience system). Now, with the 
      update, you will still get the 10 free levels, but you will also lose the 
      excess levels you accumulated previously, so that the net increase you see 
      in your skill will be lower. The most excess levels you could have 
      accumulated, however, was 8, and so at the very least you will still see 
      your skill go up by 2 points. Again, this *only* affects characters that 
      meet the following conditions:<br>
      1) Invested the maximum possible experience into a specialized skill 
      (approximately 4.2 billion experience);<br>
      2) *Then* turned in a tessera or Scroll of Dark Rain *for that skill*.<br>
      <br>
      (If you've never heard of tessera or the Scroll of Dark Rain, you don't 
      need to worry about this part. Those items are quest rewards -- you would 
      know if you had turned one in.)<br>
      <br>
      So, I hope that helps to alleviate your confusion. Was it completely 
      incomprehensible? *grin* I am, as Ken said, buried in work tonight 
      (weekend? what's that?) but I will do my best to keep up with this thread 
      and answer any other questions that come up.<br>
