      March 2001</b></span><br>
      The winter snows have given way to the song of spring across Dereth. As
      the land awakens from its slumber the Children of Ispar find the stirrings
      of adventure filling their hearts once again.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the desert a new portal has opened into
      the catacombs beneath Samsur, within three Undead that speak of collecting
      their memories inside of tiny pyramids reside. These pyramids are carried
      by the strongest and most intelligent of the undead and are scattered
      throughout Dereth. To unlock the memories within one needs to craft an
      ornate key from the heart of Golem with a tool purchased from one of three
      towns and their understanding of locks as their only guides. An unlocked
      pyramid gains a greater reward from these undead collectors.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Tufa, humans have taken to collecting
      these green triangles as well. Their rewards are those of new arrowheads,
      potent healing kits, and gems that purge harmful spells from one's being.
      Again the unlocked forms of these pyramids grant a greater reward.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But traveling in the desert has become
      difficult as the floating Virindi masters have become increasingly
      aggressive, sending new creations out into the world to strike down the
      other races of Dereth. Undead creations, called Marionettes, glide across
      the landscape, their lifeless bodies dancing to the machinations of a
      cruel puppeteer. Standing beside their grim cohorts are Dolls, creatures
      made from nothing more than energy and cherubic masks that terrorize those
      who travel the desert sands.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These two new additions to the Virindi
      forces are augmented by the arrival of new Virindi champions. Swathed in
      cloaks of near impenetrable darkness these Virindi Executors assault and
      lay waste to rank upon rank of Dereth's defenders. In the remote town of
      Ayan Baqur these beings are most prominent as here they bolster the
      Virindi troops that lie just beyond the town's border.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As adventurers brave the forces on the
      Obsidian Plains they find that Virindi and their most feared servitors,
      Hollow Minions, now carry vibrant, radiant, and alien devices. These
      devices bind themselves to those who touch them, but only those with the
      greatest knowledge of locks armed with the intricate tools for carving
      keys can craft them into anything usable by Isparians. The resulting
      Singularity keys are used to unlock the floating troves guarded by the
      most dominant of the Virindi.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What designs do the floating masters have
      planned for the future? Is it their taint that stains the sky? These
      mysteries remain yet unanswered.</font>
