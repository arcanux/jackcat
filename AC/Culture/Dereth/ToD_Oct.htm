		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=282">Turbine Site</a> 
		- Oct. 11, 2004</font></span><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hail and 
		well met!</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It really seems like just a couple days 
		ago that we stood before you at Turbine Nation and unveiled some of the 
		details of the upcoming Asheron's Call expansion pack, <i>Throne of 
		Destiny</i>.&nbsp; Hard to believe it has actually been two months (!!!); 
		time to start talking in even more detail about what you can expect to 
		see when <i>AC: TD</i> ships.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Beginning this week and continuing every 
		week until the launch, we'll be posting one or more new articles, FAQs, 
		forum threads, art pieces and/or dev diaries from the <i>Throne of 
		Destiny</i> development team.&nbsp; The goal here is two-fold; let you know 
		some of the details of what is happening, so you can comment and ask 
		questions about them, and, frankly, to tease y'all a little bit between 
		now and the launch, because we haven't yet revealed all of the new 
		features that will launch with <i>TD</i> (why, yes, I <i>was</i> a 
		marketing puke once, briefly; does it show?).&nbsp; We'll cover everything 
		from the new minimum machine specs you'll need to run the game to how 
		the level cap, augmentation gems and rare items will work in the game to 
		just what the graphics upgrade will look like when the 6,000 textures 
		have been replaced.&nbsp; Every subject we cover will have a forum thread 
		assigned to it, so you can comment and ask questions.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I can anticipate a number of your 
		questions right off the bat, so we might as well get those answers out 
		of the way now:</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, we're still on track to launch 
			in the first quarter of 2005;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, we're still upgrading the 
			engine to DirectX 9;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, the plan is still to have <i>
			Throne of Destiny</i> available at retail shops; we consider this a 
			key not only to <i>TD</i>'s success, but in attracting more players 
			to <i>Asheron's Call</i> throughout 2005;<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Yep, we're going to spend some 
			pyreals on marketing to support the <i>TD</i> launch.&nbsp; Quite a few 
			of them, in fact; I need to hit a vendor and change out some large 
			notes.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To get us started, today we've got a <i>
		Throne of Destiny</i> overview FAQ, an article on raising the level cap 
		and a dev diary and bio from srand, our Lead Engineer for the expansion. 
		Later in the week we'll be talking about augmentation gems and have a 
		bio of another one of the team members and we'll just continue on from 
		there.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of us on the AC franchise – &nbsp;the Live 
		Team, the expansion pack team, QA, NetOps and the Envoys – want to thank 
		you again for supporting the game, especially since we reacquired it 
		last year.&nbsp; It means a lot to us that you still play and enjoy AC; 
		you're the reason we're investing millions of dollars and tens of 
		thousands of development hours in the game.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Regards,</font></p>
