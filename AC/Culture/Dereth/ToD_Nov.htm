		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=307">Turbine Site</a> 
		- Nov. 4, 2004</font></span><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, here we 
		are coming into the home stretch before the holidays and things are 
		really popping on <i>Throne of Destiny</i> development.&nbsp; We're working 
		like dogs to get everything in shape to declare a key milestone, Code 
		and Content Complete, a.k.a. CCC.&nbsp; This is the stage where all the 
		mechanical bits and pieces have to be in the code build and available 
		for testing.&nbsp; We have to get to this point to start the detailed, 
		soup-to-nuts QA testing, as opposed to &quot;unit testing,&quot; where we test 
		separate tasks at our desks before checking it in for further QA 
		attention.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're at that stage where we can see the 
		major pieces starting to come together and it is very satisfying to see 
		your work beginning to take shape on the screen.&nbsp; Our current plan is to 
		hit CCC before the Christmas holidays, when people start taking off to 
		see the family.&nbsp; Unless something slips, we'll actually beat the 
		holidays by a comfortable margin (and I hope to god I haven't jinxed 
		anything by writing that).&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, you might ask, what are we working on 
		just now to get to that point?&nbsp; Here's a quick survey of what we've been 
		working on the past couple of weeks:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>ART</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We've been spending a lot of time on 
		large palette issues the past week, specifically: What is the best way 
		to convert the texture files we're getting back from our outsourcers to 
		the new format and integrate them into the <i>Throne of Destiny</i> 
		build tree?&nbsp; Basically, we're just trying to find a way to do it in 
		batches, so we don't have to open all 6,000 textures by hand to get it 
		done.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">That isn't as easy as it sounds, due 
		mainly to some legacy code we're dealing with now.&nbsp; We'll no doubt have 
		to write a new tool to handle it efficiently; Lodestone, a consultant 
		group that we're working with on the graphics upgrade, has some clever 
		ideas we're going to try on for size.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other art tasks we've been working on 
		recently include vetting and approving the art for the new rare items, 
		integrating the new Viamontian buildings into the <i>AC:TD</i> build 
		tree so we can play around with them and really digging into modeling 
		the new quest objects.&nbsp; This week, we're also heavily into animating the 
		new monsters; the Eater is the first up.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On top of that, there are hundreds of 
		textures to be looked at every week as they come back from the artists.&nbsp; 
		We check for quality, send back some of them for another revision and 
		update an Excel spreadsheet with the results (and if I never have to 
		look at another 6,000-plus line spreadsheet again, I won't complain; 
		there are days when my eyes bleed).</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>ENGINEERING</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The real question here is: What <i>
		haven't</i> these guys been doing lately?&nbsp; They've been working on 
		everything from finishing up the new code to raise the level cap, 
		cleaning up the Augmentation Gems code, doing some polishing on Rare 
		Items code, to some scary, low-level work on the engine to support 
		DirectX 9 in the graphic upgrade.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're also porting back, where it makes 
		sense for AC, some core engine and server code changes in the 
		Middle-Earth Online development tree.&nbsp; This doesn't mean we're porting 
		back the MEO graphics engine; the incompatibility between using Maya and 
		bones in MEO and the segmented limbs in AC is just too great.&nbsp; Rather, 
		we're pulling back some nice bits of code that should optimize some 
		functions (and I think I'll save a full explanation of just what we're 
		grabbing for a subsequent Letter; it is actually pretty interesting).&nbsp; 
		The Core Software team in Westwood has been doing some nice work and we 
		decided to add a couple days to the current milestone to grab some of 
		it.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>CONTENT</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Crowley and the Content crew is currently 
		finishing building out the dungeons and quests from their spec 
		documents, polishing up more web lore stories for posting and working on 
		revisions with the in-house artists as they model and texture the 
		objects that go with the quests.&nbsp; All of this involves a number of 
		separate tasks for each component; for example, checking the quest 
		object textures to make sure they portray just what the designer 
		intended and that the object itself is what the designer is looking for.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of all the crews here, this one is the 
		most likely to be finished first, even though they are building out a 
		large amount of content; five years of work on the Worldbuilder tools 
		have eased the way.&nbsp; They are taking advantage of that to add quantity 
		to quality.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PRODUCTION</b></font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Production Director, Steve Kaminsky, 
		who is also my co-Executive Producer, has been spending a good amount of 
		time honchoing work on the cinematic trailer that will be included with 
		the expansion pack.&nbsp; He's the right man for that job; check out his 
		credits at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0436756/">
		http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0436756/</a>.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As part of that, he's negotiating with a 
		'name' Hollywood actor to provide the voice-over for the trailer; more 
		on that as it happens, but we've got our fingers crossed.&nbsp; The actor 
		visited the studio to see what we're doing and you would not <i>believe</i> 
		how shamelessly srand threw herself at him.&nbsp; I mean, really, now; I had 
		bruises over half my body from the way she tried to elbow past me.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to all that, Steve has been 
		maintaining the production schedules; if you've ever worked on a game 
		development project, you know what an excruciatingly detailed – and 
		thankless – task that is.&nbsp; It isn't just making lists; it involves 
		talking to everyone on the project, looking at results and making sure 
		everyone knows the state of everyone else's tasks.&nbsp; He's an ace at it; 
		this is one of the few projects I've seen in game development where we 
		actually know the true state of every single task and how close to 
		completion each one is.&nbsp; Rather mind-boggling, considering the thousands 
		of separate tasks that need to be tracked.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And that is where we're at right now.&nbsp; 
		We're still on track for release in the first quarter of 2005 and things 
		are starting to come together nicely.&nbsp; You'll be the final judge, but we 
		truly believe this will be a worthy addition to AC.</font></p>
