    Valentine's Day -- when a young warrior's heart turns from carnage to more 
    romantic pursuits. In honor of the holiday, we asked our players to send in 
    their tales of love (or woe) in the course of Asheron's Call. The results 
    proved as varied as they were plentiful: Stories of marriages made and 
    marriages strained, off-line romances blossoming, even mournful accounts of 
    unrequited love. To celebrate the day, we'd like to share some of our 
    favorite tales that we received, and give hearty thanks to everyone for 
    writing in! </font></p>

    Since our wedding day, my husband and I promised that we would write to you 
    and thank you for &quot;introducing us.&quot; Without Asheron's Call, we would have 
    never met and married. We married on December 30, 2000 -- just two months 
    ago. <br>
    <br>
    Chris &quot;Trip&quot; Lee and I, Christine &quot;Morrigana&quot; Lee, lived about four states 
    apart. We met on Asheron's Call, shortly after Solclaim came up. One 
    afternoon, Trip approached me and asked if I'd like to hunt with him. I 
    turned to look at him. I wondered who he was, why he was talking to me, and 
    if I should run away really fast. I asked him if he was planning on getting 
    me killed. He replied, “I'd never do that to any of my friends.” I concluded 
    that he had me confused with someone else, but I went with him to the 
    Disaster Maze anyway. We had a wonderful time draining Tuskers. It was an 
    awesome “first date.”<br>
    <br>
    Hours later, we returned to Baishi, and upon our arrival, he asked me what 
    it would take to marry me. Nervously I said, “I think we should date more 
    first.” However, after that day, we were inseparable. We soon started 
    e-mailing each other and voice chatting. We'd chat late into the night. We'd 
    try to fall asleep near our computers so we didn't have to say good-bye. 
    Miraculously, my family planned a Thanksgiving vacation located about two 
    hours away from where Trip lived. I told him about our vacation, so he and I 
    made plans to meet. It was love at first sight. We spent a glorious holiday 
    together. We knew in our hearts, this was “it.” A week after I had returned 
    home, Chris proposed, and I accepted. A month later, we married! <br>
    <br>
    Thank you AC Team! <br>

      My boyfriend Lee and I both play Asheron's Call. He's been playing since 
      the very beginning, while I started playing late last October. I would 
      have to say that, for the most part, it has been a positive influence on 
      our relationship. He helped me tremendously at the beginning, making sure 
      I had armor light enough to wear, supplies, weapons, and tools, as well as 
      helping to keep my poor first-level cook from getting almost killed by 
      wimpy monsters like Gnawer Shreths and Drudges! And, since he has two 
      computers at his place, we actually play together quite often -- and I 
      have the game on my machine at home, so we can play on evenings we don't 
      spend together. He has a character who is my alter-ego's &quot;boyfriend&quot; and 
      who has come to my rescue when other players have flirted too much. It's 
      kind of cute. <br>
      <br>
      There are times when it causes stress . . . like when he came home to find 
      me in tears when I got turned around fleeing from monsters and ended up 
      running all the way from Holtburg to Cragstone in a panic and couldn't get 
      back. There was also the argument when I needed a grinder desperately, and 
      when he came into some pyreals he spent them on armor for his new archer! 
      Or the little annoyances on both our parts, like my insisting on searching 
      EVERY corpse and having to stop to kill too many rabbits, and his killing 
      things before I get to them, or telling me I'm not strong enough to attack 
      something while he goes off and one-shots it. <br>
      <br>
      But overall it's definitely been more good than bad, and AC is definitely 
      a big part of our lives. His brother and sister-in-law also play, so it 
      becomes quite fun when we run into them online. <br>
      <br>
      And when we have a disagreement &quot;away from keyboard&quot; -- there's no better 
      way to work off the frustration than to go out and kick some Drudge butt!

      I am twenty-seven years old and my husband is thirty. Currently, I live in 
      Washington and due to army schooling, he lives in North Carolina. He has 
      been there for about eight months and will be there for at least eight 
      more. <br>
      <br>
      When he is able to, we play Asheron's Call all the time. Long distance 
      bills being what they are, we can get together in AC for sometimes the 
      entire day and be able to feel like we are together even if we aren't. 
      With the 3000 mile separation, it is very nice to be able to connect this 
      way and do something fun together (vs. opening a monotonous chat window 
      for a couple hours and trying not to fall asleep). <br>
      <br>
      In real life I have pledged myself to him, and likewise in the game I have 
      become his faithful vassal. He performs his husbandly duties in AC taking 
      care of me and making sure I have whatever I need to keep in good health. 
      It might not be the same as having him at my side, but it is the next 
      closest thing. <br>

      <i>My entry might be a little different from many that you receive; it's a 
      third person narrative. To set the scene: I'm the wife that the essay 
      refers to. My husband is the &quot;Dereth adventurer.&quot; I hope you enjoy it.</i><br>
      <br>
      It commands his time without waiting its turn and teases him with ideas of 
      uber-loot and the ever-present promise of leveling. His face shines, 
      radiantly, in the soft glow of the computer screen and his hearing 
      responds only to the eerie death shrieks of high-level Drudges or the 
      spawning swoosh of a Virindi Servant. With his headset on, he game-voices 
      his way through the plains and dungeons of Dereth. Never is a pause made 
      to remember the wife that he has left at home -- sitting, ten feet away, 
      on the sofa. In the real world, conversations center around 
      friends-unseen-with-last-names-unknown or computer upgrades and 
      improvements. “All the better to experience Dereth with, my dear. . .”<br>
      <br>
      Screams of frustration and loud yells of sheer fright can go unanswered. . 
      . because they were rhetorical, anyway. The perceived laughing of Tusker 
      Guards once his back is turned is met with renewed determination and the 
      voicing of the intention to attack and destroy. <br>
      <br>
      Spectators swing between the emotions of amusement and concern as they 
      watch the schizophrenic behavior of a man living in two worlds, two minds, 
      and two realities. Daring to speak is a risky business. Break his 
      concentration and the penalties could be steep. It could mean a trip back 
      to the lifestone for the offender and fifteen years of vitae. <br>
      <br>
      Hours and minutes that drag by for his wife -- still alone and lonely in 
      the real world -- pass by at sheer warp speed for our Dereth adventurer as 
      he pounds at his keyboard and “screams like a girl.” Mesmerized by the 
      multi-colored text of conversation and of battle, he doesn't acknowledge 
      the disappearance of his wife to bed and the -- by comparison -- animated 
      company of her fiction novel. Oh, well. . . just one more thing away from 
      the screen that he has failed to notice. <br>

      It was a relationship not meant to be. With her beautiful pale skin, green 
      eyes, and pretty face. And there was me, born with an ugly face, in armor 
      that never matched. But for some reason we both loved each other. She had 
      a high and pretty voice, almost one like a cat's meow. Mine cracked and 
      squeaked. Yes, I do not know how we stayed together for so long. . . until 
      the end. <br>
      <br>
      For that one fateful day we decided to hunt together, and I have doomed 
      our relationship ever since. She had just leveled up, I distinctly 
      remember, and I was not sure what level she had achieved. I clicked on her 
      in order to assess her, but accidentally clicked attack low. . . <br>
