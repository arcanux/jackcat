		Turbine Site</a> - Oct. 11, 2004<br>
&nbsp;</font></span><div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Who are you?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My name is Sandra Powers, a.k.a. srand, 
		and I'm the lead engineer for the Throne of Destiny expansion. As lead 
		engineer, I'm in charge of a small team of programmers who are furiously 
		at work both on improving the graphics experience in Asheron's Call, and 
		on implementing all the intriguing new features we're going to be 
		discussing in the coming months. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What do you actually do?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I spend a good bit of my time on the 
		details: reviewing with what the engineers are doing; making sure we're 
		on schedule; dealing with difficulties as they arise; coordinating and 
		communicating with art, design, and the live team. I'm also the 
		engineering contact point for the executives, marketing &amp; basically 
		anyone who needs engineering input to answer a question. I often don't 
		have those answers myself, but I know which engineer to ask, and I can 
		translate the response back into English. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rest of my time is spent designing 
		and implementing the game systems for the expansion. That includes major 
		new features such as raising the level cap and smaller content support 
		tasks such as providing treasure tables for Viamontians. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">How did you end up here?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I first started working on Asheron's Call 
		in December of 2000, when I was hired – more or less straight out of 
		college – to program game systems for AC2. At that time, there weren't 
		any actual game systems for AC2 yet – none of the combat, skills, 
		inventory, etc. existed yet – so I trained by fixing bugs on AC1. Even 
		after AC2 got off the ground I continued to do a little work on AC1 on 
		the side, and in January of 2002 I moved onto the AC1 team full time.
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I remained the primary game systems 
		engineer on AC1 Live until mid-2003, at which point Jessica Mulligan 
		(our Executive Producer) loaded me down with the additional title of 
		Producer. I handed that hat off to Mirin earlier this year when we began 
		work on the expansion, but if all goes well I am slated to move back 
		into the Live Producer position after this expansion is complete. This 
		caused Ibn to bestow upon me the title of &quot;Once and Future Producer&quot;, 
		which amuses the hell out of me. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Those are the facts; more subjectively, I 
		applied to Turbine because I adored Asheron's Call; I fought to be on 
		the live team because I was (and remain) completely and utterly in love 
		with the game; and I've relished every working day since – even the 
		horrible ones. Asheron's Call continues to be my favorite all-consuming 
		hobby. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your favorite quest in 
			Asheron's Call and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps it's silly, but one of my 
		favorite quests has always been retrieving Miyako's book of poetry from 
		the Mysterious Tunnels in Nanto. It's a simple quest with a lot of 
		atmosphere, and the dungeon is just gorgeous. There's a variety of newer 
		quests that are just as good, but Miyako's quest is everything I want in 
		an accessible, stylish bundle. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm also quite fond of Runed chests 
		because I spend so much time running randomly cross-country. I'm not 
		sure that Runed chests count as a quest as such, but they certainly give 
		me something to do. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">What is your least favorite monster 
			and why?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Generally speaking, I kill without 
		prejudice. But if I have to pick a monster type that I'm just not 
		terribly fond of, it would probably be elementals of all sorts.&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Where did you get your nickname?</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've used a number of names since I 
		started on the bulletin boards back in high school – although only ever 
		one at a time, of course. I started using srand just before I 
		transitioned to the AC1 team. It's my favorite nickname because it fits 
		me in so many ways. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Firstly, srand is a code term – many 
		programming languages have a method called srand which seeds the random 
		number generator. And I am, first and foremost, a coder. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Secondly, the srand method seeds the 
		random number generator – which basically means using a non-random 
		number to set up the generator to produce pseudo-random numbers. If you 
		think of Dereth as a seething mass of chaos (and I often do), then much 
		of what I do involves using non-random methods to produce random bursts 
		of creativity and fun. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">And srand is also a partial anagram of my 
		first name, of course. Although because it lacks a vowel at the end, 
		most people assume it is a masculine name – which also amused the hell 
		out of me.<br>
