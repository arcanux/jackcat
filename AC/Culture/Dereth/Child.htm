      December 5, 2000</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Alayne looked up at the solid stone of
      Ithaenc. So this was the place that begat the end of the world.
      Interesting. The tremors had finally subsided, and the foolish adventurers
      had fled before the dark onslaught. Except for the glistening red
      waterfall pouring its fury into the sea of blood, things were quiet and
      peaceful. At least, as much as they could be.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hand of Bael'Zharon caressed Dereth,
      and the world shuddered in response. The rivers and the mountains were not
      the extent of it. The sky itself acknowledged its new lord. And troubling
      reports involving the Hopeslayer himself had come from many of his
      explorers out in Dereth. Too many.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Everywhere, people were asking, “What
      should be done?” Lesser and weaker men squabbled and squawked while
      their world fell apart. Sir Alayne had no time for discussion, no time for
      indecision. Now was the moment to act. He had already begun to extend his
      hand to the new arrivals on Dereth, preparing for the future if the world
      held.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the world held. . . . He had done all he
      could on that front. Even if what he had done would damn him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But what point to think of that? It had
      begun. He could not alter the tide of events even if he wished to do so.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bael'Zharon walked the earth, and every
      living thing felt incipient doom in those footsteps. Anything done to
      defeat the Shadows was justifiable. Anything.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The water continued falling to the sea, red
      mingling with red in a bloody froth. Out of the corner of his eye, he
      noticed a cluster of verdalim plants succumbing to the increasing cold. .
      . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Enough. It was foolish to put this off any
      longer.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Shurov Thiloi.&quot; Ithaenc
      dissolved into a field of blue. Alayne tried not to think of who would be
      greeting him when he stepped out of the portal.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the 
      world of Dereth continues to evolve each and every month. New lands have 
      been discovered, new creatures battled. Towns and seasons have even come 
      and gone. Consider last month, when island explorations discovered the 
      Shard of the Herald -- the final crystal of the dread Hopeslayer's prison. 
      One can only wonder what changes and additions will soon take place when 
      we open our December event, “<i>The Child of Daralet</i>.” Be sure to 
      continue your part in this incredible ongoing story, and we'll see you in 
      Dereth! Now, more than ever before, are heroes needed.<br>

      - From the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/decrollout.asp">Zone</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">December 12, 2000</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many first learned of the Soul Stone
      crystals during last year's Sudden Season event. Then, the Great Work held
      the very world captive, draining Dereth's heat and plunging all into a
      wintry abyss. Yet the heroes of the land rallied, destroying the Great
      Work and freeing Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More crystals were to come.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Animate fragments, glittering across the
      landscape, promised swift death to the unwary traveler. Further Soul
      Stones were also found, hidden deep within the dungeon Vestibules.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These, too, Dereth's heroes destroyed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most recently, explorers discovered the
      jungle-strewn Vesayen archipelago, and on its last isle, the final crystal
      Soul Stone -- the Shard of the Herald. Many heroes attacked, thinking to
      do what was right and just, and completely rid Dereth of these malignant
      artifacts. Yet however dangerous they might seem, the crystals also served
      a higher purpose, as the prison for the dread Hopeslayer, Bael'Zharon.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the final crystal broken, the prison
      itself shattered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bael'Zharon has been freed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rising from his ancient slumber, the
      Hopeslayer's presence has had immediate effect upon the world. Swollen
      rivers flow this Snowreap, yet stained with the crimson taint of blood.
      Other patches of land, formerly rich with fauna, have been found dead and
      blasted, more akin to the Obsidian Plains than anywhere else.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Already, heroes of the highest valor have
      begun joining together to face this evil, able to swear renewed bonds of
      fellowship. Vowing to share the danger, in this and other causes, they've
      agreed to better share the rewards of experience.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, those recently arrived to Dereth
      will need to learn far more of the world before daring to face its dread
      Hopeslayer. To this end, several incredible quests await those looking for
      training and experience; from Al Arqas to Yaraq, younger adventurers have
      come to wonder about the mysterious letters filtering into the towns. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the terror facing this month, a few
      pleasant moments nevertheless present themselves. Certain winter plants
      have come into season, promising fresh colors of dye for armor and
      clothing. With the temperature dropping and many starting to don their
      furry matty coats, adventurers will find that even newer coats of hide,
      and other well-crafted pieces of armor, have been devised. For some, the
      winter months mean more time spent indoors; as such, scholars have
      finished collating the history of Dereth for the various libraries.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Still, of the changes and additions taking
      place this month, nothing compares to the release of Bael'Zharon. Truly,
      this will prove a time when even the strongest heroes pray while lesser
      ones weep.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the 
    most interesting additions made to the game this update. However, please 
    note that not all changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of 
    finding out everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the 
    town criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the 
    trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and 
    abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Highlights include: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Changes to the fellowship system have been 
      implemented. The possible fellowships that can now be created are as 
      follows: </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1. Players can 
      choose to use the communication advantages of a fellowship without having 
      to share experience points. There is no level restriction for choosing 
      this option. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Experience 
      points are shared equally amongst all members of the fellowship if 
      everyone is within five levels of the fellowship's founder. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Experience 
      points will be shared proportional to the levels of the fellowship members 
      if anyone is more than five levels apart from the founder, up to a 
      difference of ten levels. <br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Around two-dozen quests for low-level 
      characters have had their rewards greatly increased, and a wide-ranging 
      “stamped letter” quest has been added as well. To find out more, talk to 
      vendors and collectors in those towns where new characters appear. It's 
      never been more fun to be a new character in Dereth! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Landscape changes reflect the release of 
      the dread Hopeslayer. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Corpse decay time is now a minimum of 
      sixty minutes. All corpses will decay in the character's level times five 
      minutes, or sixty minutes -- whichever time is longer. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Players can now wield an orb, wand, or 
      staff, and use trade skills at the same time. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Incorrect (and especially damaging) attack 
      types of those monsters on the Vesayen Isles have now been changed. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The bug allowing players to summon an 
      untie-able portal has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Changes have been made to help prevent 
      portal storming -- including storms to the particularly bad location near 
      Fort Tethana as well as onto Aerlinthe and Eastham Islands. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New fashion items have arrived just in 
      time for the cold winter months. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New seasonal plants for dyes can now be 
      found on the landscape. </font></li>

      <b><a name="fellow"></a>Upcoming Fellowship Changes</b> 
      - From the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEfellowship.asp">Zone</a></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">December 
    7, 2000</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">This 
    month, we're introducing a major enhancement to the fellowship system which 
    should make it much more appealing and useful for all players. In the past, 
    players were limited by the narrow level restrictions of the system, and 
    many disliked the proportional experience point (XP) sharing. Many players 
    didn't want any XP sharing at all, but wished they could utilize the 
    communication and targeting enhancements that fellowships allowed. In 
    addition, upon reaching “extreme” levels, the 10-level restriction made even 
    less sense, as a level 55 and a level 80 player might very well wish to 
    collaborate on the same quest but were unable to use the fellowship system 
    to help them do so. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, say hello to progress! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On your fellowship panel, starting in 
    December's “<i>The Child of Daralet</i>” event, there will be a checkbox 
    allowing you to choose between two different types of fellowship -- XP 
    Sharing and Non-XP Sharing/No Level Limit. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fellowships will be defaulted to XP-Sharing. 
    If all members of the fellowship are within 5 levels of the founder, XP will 
    be shared <i><b>equally</b></i>. If members are all within ten levels of the 
    founder, XP will be shared proportionally, much like in the old system.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If all members of the fellowship are level 50 
    or above, all members will share XP equally, and there will be no limit to 
    the levels of the members involved! Players of level 50, 55, 70, and 90 
    could all be in the same fellowship, each earning 25% of the XP. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alternatively, <i><b>any </b></i>ten players 
    can join a No XP-Sharing/No Level Limit fellowship, which functions pretty 
    much as it sounds. A level 2, a level 20, and a level 80 player could all be 
    in the same fellowship for targeting and communication purposes, but no XP 
    would be shared between them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the makeup of a fellowship changes such 
    that it would invalidate the current type, the fellowship will dynamically 
    change to accommodate this. For example, if a level 10 player creates an 
    XP-Sharing fellowship, and a level 5 and a level 15 player join, they will 
    split the XP equally. If a level 20 player subsequently joins, the 
    fellowship will automatically change to a proportional sharing fellowship. 
    If the level 20 player then leaves, the fellowship will revert to the way it 
    was; there will be no need to recreate the fellowship. (However, you will 
    have to recreate the fellowship if you wish to change from XP-Sharing to 
    Non-XP-Sharing.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're sure that these changes will make 
    adventuring in the land of Dereth a more easily coordinated venture for 
    allegiances, friends, and mercenaries. Enjoy, and happy questing! </font>

      - December 8, 2000</b> </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>A Tale of Six Crystals (or, “It was the best of 
    events, it was the worst of events. . .”) </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    December will mark the culmination of a twelve-month story arc, which has 
    ranged from the icy caverns of Frore, to the tops of the Shadow Spires, to 
    the enigmatic Nexus facility, to the smoldering crater where Arwic once 
    stood. A war has waged over the entire last year, and countless casualties 
    -- humans, shadows, and even the poor Arwic cow -- have been inflicted. Now, 
    this war's final battle is at hand. Bael'Zharon has been freed from his 
    crystal prison of two thousand years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'd like to talk a bit about the November 
    event and the Shard of the Herald. A lot of what we did in November came 
    from reaction to player feedback. In prior months, especially regarding the 
    Nexus, players complained that there was no way to intervene in the 
    plotline. People wanted the chance to defend the crystal, to keep BZ 
    imprisoned. We thought that this would make for fantastic role-playing, and 
    tried to come up with a system that would allow people to take a more active 
    part in the event. Thus the PK-only dungeon for the final Shard was created. 
    We wanted to give the players a choice -- to defend the Shard, or to destroy 
    it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What followed became, half by design, half by 
    fortune, what was probably the most dramatic event in any ORPG to date. 
    While most worlds broke the crystal in rather short order, Thistledown 
    mounted a defense. And what a defense it was! The Shard was monitored around 
    the clock in well-organized shifts. Needless to say, this exceeded our 
    expectations by a long shot! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The premise behind the event was good, but 
    was immediately complicated by a rather irritating bug. There was a means by 
    which people could summon portals to unintended places -- as a result, the 
    defense could be bolstered more than we ever expected, and perhaps more 
    importantly, non-PKs could get into the dungeon to shatter the crystal. 
    Secondly, we discovered that Harry (a.k.a. Harold, a.k.a. The Shard of the 
    Herald) was leveling at an unexpectedly high rate, making the crystal nigh 
    invulnerable as long as someone stayed with it at all times. Ah, the plot 
    thickens! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps the most telling aspect of the whole 
    event was that, despite the ability to do so, non-PK players never broke the 
    Shard. According to every law of game design and human nature, we figured 
    the Shard would fall that way. But it never did. And we are impressed.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the event progressed, it became clear that 
    the defenders had the means to achieve victory, and that meant we needed to 
    turn to Plan B. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Plan B was also created in direct response to 
    player feedback. One of the things made loud and clear after the destruction 
    of the Cragstone Spire, and the rubble-ifying of Arwic, was that people 
    didn't like it when big events happened “off camera.” This is essentially 
    what we would have had to do for December. You see, we can't really have our 
    servers diverge -- for the storyline to progress, we needed BZ free on all 
    worlds in December. So, we had two choices: Wave our hands mysteriously and 
    say, “Well, some . . . um . . . mysterious force broke the crystal, and BZ's 
    free now.” Or, we could get directly involved, and have the event take place 
    “on camera.” Thus did Plan B come to pass. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On Tuesday, we sent out a world broadcast to 
    let everyone know that the show was far from over -- Bael'Zharon called out 
    to his faithful for aid. Interestingly enough, Thistledown happened to have 
    the two players who passed BZ's test back in March. Vidorian and Blackthorn 
    had both received a Shadow Stone in exchange for a favor to be named later. 
    Time to call in that favor! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Leh Rhan and Ferah had been biding their 
    time, waiting to see if BZ's followers were indeed faithful to their dark 
    master, or if they had turned to the banner of the traitor Dule. The crystal 
    prison still stood, and the time had drawn too short. The Isparian killers 
    had made their choice, much to the anger of the loyalist generals. They 
    gathered up the true servants of Bael'Zharon, and moved in his name. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The reality of the matter was that we tried 
    something that we had never really done before -- get directly involved in 
    the action, and tell a bit of the story ourselves, so that the plot could 
    continue. Another reason that fueled the timing of the event was the fact 
    that we wanted TD players to have a few days to see BZ in his lair, as well 
    as to take a shot at the Black Breath and the Treasury of the Order. To make 
    this all happen and, most importantly, to make it happen in-game and “on 
    camera,” we brought in two admin characters to take care of business. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To set the scene on our end, imagine Jesse at 
    his desk, two computers running. Crowd about four people around him. In the 
    conference room, pile in twenty people, watching a live video feed of the 
    action on a television. (We're cleaning up the .avi that we recorded from 
    the event, for release to the fansites; expect this in the next couple 
    weeks.) The conference room and Jesse are connected via speakerphone. 
    Shouting, chatting, cheering. Add in Dave Namerow, better equipped than most 
    fighter pilots, with a couple messengers and observers on hand. The word is 
    given, and the camera rolls. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, you should have heard the laughter and 
    jeers when Jesse died. (Which paled in comparison to our reaction of people 
    jumping up and down on his corpse!) Let's just say that this did not exactly 
    run according to the script. Truth is, the event was scripted to be a lot 
    shorter and cleaner -- summon the Black Breath, which, aided by Jesse, would 
    clear the room pretty quickly. We'd debuff Harry, to make the crystal mortal 
    again, bring Vidorian in to get the kill, and then get out. Nice and simple.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What actually happened was a little bit 
    eerie. Harold resisted our attempts to alter him. And then, he refused to 
    die. We were worried that perhaps the Shard had achieved sentience. I guess 
    we'll never know, because we finally figured out how to make Harry 
    vulnerable again, and after an extended struggle, he fell. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The end result was messier than we would have 
    liked. Vidorian died a few times, defenders died left and right, and my 
    blood pressure went much higher than I would have preferred. Truth is, we 
    didn't expect Plan B to ever come to pass, and as a result we were already 
    deep into testing December's update when we needed to prepare this special 
    event for November. All in all, we considered the event a success, but with 
    definite room for improvement. The action had taken place “on camera” as 
    planned, and the story was ready to move forward again, all lore intact.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All in all, we learned an awful lot from the 
    event. We were breaking new ground and weren't aware of all the pitfalls. 
    Well, now we've got a better grasp on things, and we give thanks to our 
    players for bearing with us through this learning process. The entire 
    dynamic created this month was very exciting indeed! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In closing there's one thing that I want to 
    make abundantly clear: We did not do this to “make the defenders lose.” We 
    did this <i>because </i>the defenders had won. In January, Thistledown 
    residents are going to be rewarded with a unique monument, in honor of the 
    Defense of the Shard. It's not ph4t l3wt, but we didn't feel we could 
    individually reward each and every person who participated in the defense. 
    Instead, the memorial will be a reminder of this unique event, and a 
    reminder that there are rewards to be reaped and lessons to be learned by 
    challenging the notions of what “can't be done” in an online world! </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Congratulations to all involved! </font></p>

      the chat. I'll turn things over to DaveJ to get things rolling, then 
      head-first into the questions we'll go. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; So... a word about the dagger &quot;fix.&quot; The fix has not yet 
      been seen. The &quot;fix&quot; in its complete glory will be seen in January. 
      December has a &quot;preview&quot; of the fix. You'll know it when you see it. 
      Beyond that, I can't give any other hints. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; and with that, bring on the questions! <br>

      ken@turbine&gt; we have some ideas for lockpick...but they mostly involve

      <br>
      Gooopsta&gt; I've heard things like you are horribly understaffed, and only 
      one person works on the game at a time. I don't know how much of it is 
      true, but I do know that the player base is tiny compared to other MMORPGS, 
      and I think I've seen... <br>
      <br>
      Gooopsta&gt; one ad for AC in the last year. It's also really hard to find AC 
      in many stores, and in some cases they have stopped selling copies. As a 
      long time player, I just want to know what you guys think about the game, 
      it's future, and longevity. </b><br>
      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; Well, I'll be as forthcoming as I can, here. <br>
      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; We've got a small staff doing ongoing updates. More than one, 
      less than a dozen. <br>
      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; We're still in some stores, and we do intend to grow the game 
      over time. <br>
      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; AC's got plenty of future ahead of it, worry not. <br>
      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; DaveJ had a comment, too. <br>

      Crowley@turbine&gt; I have one comment on small team size: we are few but we

      <b>Mr_Nox&gt; Q: Great game but why a year on are there still so many flaws 
      in the game? For example need 100+ strength to carry the pyreals I need to 
      buy my Master-Robe, some skills are just plain useless (lockpick, thrown 
      weapons)... <br>
      <br>
      Mr_Nox&gt; warriors make poor followers cos' the stat used to calculate their 
      loyalty is useless to them, also if a warrior want's to use magic items he 
      needs Arcane Lore another skill based on Stats he doesn't particularly 
      need... <br>
      <br>
      Mr_Nox&gt; even though a swordsman can be incredibly skilled with his weapon 
      that doesn't mean he'll be able to ID any swords he comes across because 
      the ID skill is again based on a stat he doesn't really need... <br>
      <br>
      Mr_Nox&gt; Oh! Specialised War Magic costs too many skill points, didn't we 
      play a beta to sort these things out. ga. </b><br>
      <br>
      ken@turbine&gt; I agree that there are a lot of issues with balance in AC, as 
      there would be with any game of this scope and reach...that said, I think 
      each month we get closer to shaping AC into a better and more balanced 
      game. However, due to the fact that certain... <br>
      <br>
      ken@turbine&gt; dynamics are now solidly entrenched in the game, it will be 
      very hard to tinker with those dynamics...but we still hope to make the 
      game as fun as possible even with those constraints <br>

      working. When im healin myself it use stamina (why and for what?) and with 
      skill healing bout 200, i dont see any diference between good, expert and 
      peerless healing kits. <br>
      <br>
      SQAFiLCoN&gt; I found out that healing is workin better in peace mode (less 
      fails). Am I right? </b><br>

      <b>SQAFiLCoN&gt; thnx =o] </b><br>
      <br>
      nei@turbine&gt; if you want to wait like 10 minutes, i can get back to you 
      with a &quot;decent&quot; answer. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; quality of kit determines how many points you get back 
      with each successful healing check. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; it is easier to heal when you're more lightly wounded.
      <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; so don't wait until you're down to your last 10 or 20 
      health before you use the kit. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; this is also a good question for the Q&amp;A board. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; as for the peace mode thing... I think we should wait 
      until Nei has done more research. <br>

      <b>B_Neely&gt; Q: It’s about lore. I and others have a great interest in 
      gathering knowledge. It would be nice to see “mage” types find books and 
      lost lores that would lead to quests to far away lost lands. … <br>
      <br>
      B_Neely&gt; Not exactly hand out coords but tell a story of a lost city in 
      the desert or a lost island. Give a feel more like some other book and 
      dice RPG. Except some of us can play the mage when we find the book. <br>

      Nik@turbine&gt; If I understand your question, you want more lore leading 
      people into quests? Yes, that's something we can do. Some quest have been 
      a little sparse, hint-wise. <br>

      <b>Kavad6&gt; Can you comment on fixing magic resistance? Seems it may or may

      Crowley@turbine&gt; Magic Resistance, yeah, it's not all that useful these 
      days <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; monsters have such high skill you can never resist them, 
      and their magic D is so high you can't hit them <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; we're looking at rebalancing monsters very slowly over 
      the next few months <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; magic skills and defense are prime candidates for 
      re-evaluation. <br>

      <b>Thanatos_Doom&gt; 2 questions: first is about the new server will we ever 
      see a server that starts over? from the beginning of the story, its not 
      that much fun to jump into the middle of the story, or not even be able to 
      do events/quests because i didnt buy it 6 months soo <br>
      <br>
      Thanatos_Doom&gt; what is the reason for some portals being untieable? Down

      <br>
      Nik@turbine&gt; No, there's no way to have server data diverge. And planning 
      one event per month is kinda rough as it is. :) <br>

      </a>Backstage at Asheron's Call</b> - From the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEbackstage.asp">
      Zone</a> </font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>December 13, 2000</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In this article, we'd like to better 
    illustrate how we make and maintain Asheron's Call. This should answer 
    several questions that players may have, though it likely has far more 
    detail than most players care about. If you just like playing the game, by 
    all means, do not consider this essential reading! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For those players who are interested, 
    however, we hope you find this informative. The whole “AC Team,” which 
    includes both those at Microsoft and Turbine, jointly prepared this article.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>It's been a year. What took you so long? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    To some it may seem that this article has been a long time coming. We've 
    never formally published anything of this sort before. Perhaps we have 
    waited too long; but for reasons explained below, we have tried to give our 
    players a sense of having one point of contact, and avoid giving details 
    about the many dynamic groups working together to make AC. However, now that 
    we have been producing AC for over a year, it's time to open the backstage 
    door a bit and let you see some of the “what, how, and why.” </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>So who are “we”? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Our intent has been to not distract our players with exactly who does what 
    in producing AC. All those on the AC team, no matter where they happen to 
    work, unite towards one goal: keeping our customers, the players, happy. If 
    you go to an amusement park, you should not hear the ticket taker say, 
    “Well, it's not my problem the Barf-o-Rama isn't working -- go complain to 
    the maintenance staff.” You should hear something like, “We are sorry the 
    Barf-o-Rama is out of service. We'll try to get it working as soon as 
    possible.” We want to treat our players in a similar way (though sadly there 
    is no Barf-o-Rama yet in AC). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, in nearly everything you read on 
    the AC website and in the system messages, we use the term “we” to represent 
    the entire AC Team, even if we are really talking about something that is 
    purely an issue with the game code, the network operations, the community 
    management, the website, the testing, or the like. This will not change. We 
    still think it is the best way to serve the vast majority of our players.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, we acknowledge that some players 
    really do want to know the nitty-gritty about who does what. We also want to 
    clear up some misunderstandings or incomplete assumptions that have cropped 
    up during our silence. So in this article, we'll largely drop this “we” 
    stuff and talk about the different functional groups that help make AC what 
    it is. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What are the roles of Microsoft and Turbine? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Microsoft is the “publisher” and Turbine is the “developer” of AC. Though 
    making AC is a labor of love for everyone, the general roles are most simply 
    described in financial terms. Microsoft (“MS” from here on out) supplies 
    people and money to help maintain and update AC. Expenditures include 
    management, testing, and community staff in MS, as well as equipment, 
    network costs, and so on. MS pays Turbine to continue to maintain and 
    develop AC, as well as shares with Turbine a percentage of the revenue from 
    AC sales and subscriptions. Turbine uses the funds from MS plus its own 
    investments to develop AC, doing programming, testing, art, game design, and 
    so on. As such, it's not very different from the relationship between a 
    movie producer and movie production company. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Microsoft is a developer and publisher of 
    software products and services. Nearly all the MS people who work on AC are 
    located in the Seattle area, though there are critical people in sales, 
    localization, customer support, and other functions who work worldwide. 
    Turbine is a developer of software products and services as well, including 
    games and game technologies. All of the Turbine people are located in the 
    Boston area. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most important thing to communicate here 
    is that MS and Turbine are partners in a business venture. Our relationship 
    is deeply collaborative, friendly, and oriented toward the exact same goals: 
    make money by giving our players what they love. As in any business 
    partnership, there are at times dynamic tensions among the various 
    sub-groups. This is healthy. Everyone pulls for what they think AC needs 
    most, and the ensuing discussions generate the best plans for action. What 
    we all do share, however, is interest in each other's well-being, and 
    devotion to making the best Online Role-Playing Game (ORPG) in the world.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the publisher, MS in principle has the 
    “final say” over the nature of the product presented to the players. MS 
    makes the majority of the investment and desires a certain kind of product 
    in return. However, Turbine is far from a mere contractor under orders from 
    a dominating boss. Turbine has a great deal of its own money, time, and 
    reputation invested in AC. Moreover, AC directly affects Turbine's image as 
    a company. Therefore, Turbine has a great deal of influence on AC. MS 
    realizes this and encourages it, not only because MS values Turbine as a 
    partner, but also because MS recognizes that many important decisions 
    concerning the development and evolution of AC are best left to those who 
    love the game and know it the best. Turbine is full of those people, working 
    and thinking night and day about how to make their “baby” better. That said, 
    the MS people are not a bunch of suits behind mahogany desks. The MS game 
    development group has many people who love games as well, and many of them 
    have worked at other prominent game companies. They also play AC, talk about 
    it in the hallways, devour the fansite traffic, and have their own passions 
    about what is best for the game. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though both MS and Turbine would love to add 
    everything to AC right away and make it perfect, game development and 
    publishing is a business. Contrary to popular belief, no software company -- 
    not even Microsoft! -- has a barrel of cash in the hallway with a sign 
    saying “take what you need.” Turbine does have a budget. The game 
    development group at MS also has a budget. All things considered, we think 
    we do a great job within the constraints we have, and we plan to serve our 
    players well for a long time to come. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do MS and Turbine work together? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    It's not easy to make an Online Role-Playing Game with the critical 
    development and functional groups three time zones apart. Communication and 
    a friendly relationship are the most important things to have. We are 
    constantly in touch by phone and e-mail. A big conference call takes place 
    each week that includes all of the functional “leads” (those who head up 
    each functional group) in MS and Turbine during which we discuss anything 
    and everything. In a different weekly conference call, the appropriate leads 
    discuss bugs in the game. After each monthly event, we do a “postmortem” 
    meeting by phone to discuss and document what went well and what did not go 
    so well. When we can, we get on a plane and meet in person. (Teleporter 
    vendors: please get in touch with us soon.) </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Break it down. What are the different groups and 
    functions? </b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    So, in a nutshell, here are the functional groups. Labeling is always an 
    inexact science, but this should give you a general idea of who is who. Then 
    we can explain which of these functional groups do what various things.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Developers</i>” is a general term 
    that refers to pretty much everyone at Turbine who works on AC, including 
    programmers, QA, visual and audio artists, game designers, and producers.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Publishers</i>” is also a general 
    term that refers to those at MS who make production and business decisions, 
    including planning, budget, staffing, marketing, and PR. Others at MS fall 
    under other more specific labels below. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>Programmers</i>” are those who write game 
    code, build technologies, and make development tools. They all work at 
    Turbine. (Confusingly, some use the term “developers” to refer to just 
    programmers. In our parlance, “developers” is the more general term 
    described above. Also, some “programmers” prefer to be called “software 
    engineers” or “coders”.) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>QA</i>” are those at Turbine who test the 
    game. They make sure that a “build” of game code and data are in working 
    order before it is sent to MS. They also find and confirm the fixing of many 
    bugs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>MS Test</i>” are those at MS who test the 
    game. QA and MS Test have somewhat different tasks, which are too detailed 
    to cover here. In broad terms, QA largely concentrates on detailed content 
    issues (that is, specific properties of in-game objects, places, monsters, 
    art, and so on) while MS Test does detailed testing of game code plus a 
    high-level check of the content. However, there is a lot of overlap. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>Artists</i>” refer to those who make 
    visual or audio content for AC. They all work at Turbine, though some of the 
    art in the manual, website, and setup program was done by artists at MS.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>Game Designers</i>” are the main 
    designers of the game rules and functions as the players perceive them. They 
    “spec” (specify) how various things in the game should work; they use tools 
    to map out dungeons and landscapes; they write game lore and texts; they 
    spec out quests and items; and, they also “tune” existing systems -- that 
    is, they adjust the values and strengths of things in the game to pursue the 
    philosopher's stone of “perfect play balance.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>Producers</i>” are those who direct and 
    organize the flow of work at both MS and Turbine, track schedules and 
    budgets, monitor overall quality and customer issues, report to the business 
    managers, and assure communication. At MS, the producers are called Program 
    Managers or “PMs.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Community Lead</i>” is a PM at MS who 
    closely monitors customer service issues. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Operations Staff</i>” are those at MS 
    who maintain the AC servers. They monitor the server status 24 hours a day, 
    and report problems. They also put the new “builds” on the game servers.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Zone Staff</i>” are those at MS who 
    keep the MSN Gaming Zone (which is itself a separate MS product) up and 
    running. This includes the AC website on the Zone as well as the “lobbies” 
    (those windows with the purple “play” button you click on to launch AC). 
    They also made the code that downloads new AC “client” software to you, the 
    player. When you see the “Downloading Zone Files” dialog box, it's the 
    Zone's tech giving you a new AC “client.exe” or other files to make the Zone 
    work. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Billing Staff</i>” are those on the 
    MS Zone Staff who concentrate on maintaining AC subscriptions and fixing 
    related customer problems. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>PSS</i>” are those at MS who provide 
    product service and support. They are the people you communicate with if you 
    contact Tech Support via the information provided in the front of the AC 
    manual. They provide phone support and maintain the
    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/games/Zone/Asheron/TShoot/Default.asp" target="_blank" style="color: #FFFFCC">
    troubleshooter website</a> to help solve technical problems. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“<i>The Fire Team</i>” is composed of MS 
    employees who also volunteer to play test builds of AC. They are managed by 
    MS Test, and also share the same testing goals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whew! Perhaps you now see why we tend to use 
    the catchall term “we.” Otherwise, it would really be distracting to always 
    detail exactly who is informing you of various game issues! </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do AC bugs get fixed? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    “Bugs” are those things in AC that don't work as the game creators intended. 
    The first step is to discover the bug. We find and fix most of them before 
    the update ever reaches the public. Those that “slip through,” we typically 
    discover thanks to customer reports, fansites, PSS, and the Fire Team; 
    however, sometimes they are discovered by others on the general AC Team.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once found, the bug is carefully described 
    and put into a bug database called “RAID.” Both MS and Turbine can read and 
    edit this database. The first stop for the bug is “triage” (borrowing a 
    hospital analogy). Every day, the producers, QA, and MS Test look at bugs in 
    triage and assign them to a developer to fix. At the same time, the bug is 
    rated with a “priority” (where on the big list of things to fix the bug 
    ranks) and a “severity” (how badly it affects the customer when it hits). 
    Everyone generally agrees on priority/severity the first time around, but if 
    anyone thinks a bug should be a different priority, they can send it back to 
    triage for reconsideration. The goal is to have everyone agree on a bug's 
    priority, and that is almost always accomplished. Developers then fix the 
    bugs in the order of their priority. If faced with bugs of equal priority, 
    developers generally tackle those of the greatest severity. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So the developers, always hard at work, look 
    at bugs in RAID assigned to them and fix them as soon as they can. Very 
    serious bugs can get fixed right away (more on this below). Bugs of urgent 
    priority get fixed in the next monthly update, while bugs of less urgent 
    priority may or may not get fixed as soon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A developer, upon fixing a bug, “resolves” it 
    and assigns it to QA or MS Test to confirm that it is in fact fixed. If the 
    fix is confirmed, the bug is then “closed.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is very rare that we disagree over when or 
    how to fix a particular bug. We nearly always achieve our goal of decision 
    by consensus. If a bug needs more discussion, it goes to “supertriage,” 
    which is a weekly phone meeting of all the relevant leads at MS and Turbine.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Usually we fix bugs in the next monthly 
    update. However, if a bug is especially problematic for a large number of 
    players, or threatens the stability or integrity of the game, we may want to 
    “hotfix” it, meaning we fix it before the next monthly update. Once again, 
    we nearly always all agree on whether a bug merits a hotfix or not, and if 
    we don't, we try to keep discussing it until we have a consensus. A hotfix 
    eats up a lot of time from a lot of people who are otherwise working hard on 
    future monthly updates. Even a couple days of delay can throw off our pace 
    for the entire month. Not only does the hotfix need to be coded and built, 
    it also needs a full testing cycle since even a tiny fix can break something 
    else, with major consequences. Next, our Operations Staff needs to get up in 
    the wee hours of the morning to put (or “prop”) the new build onto the 
    servers. During the prop, the servers are all shut down and nobody can play 
    (that's why we do it in the wee hours of the morning). When the worlds are 
    restarted after the prop, there is a chance for instability. For all these 
    reasons, we try to hotfix only when we can make and fix the bug quickly, and 
    when it is important enough to risk stability and the loss of time. </font>
    </p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How do new things get added to AC? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Each monthly update starts off as a “spec,” or documented specification. It 
    starts in brainstorming sessions among the game designers, drawing from 
    ideas within Turbine, MS, and from the players themselves. The game 
    designers write up specs that describe what the next month should bring. 
    This process begins several weeks before the public gets the update. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The PM at MS comments on and approves the 
    specs, representing what the publisher wants in the product -- that is, 
    happy players of all types, as well as good opportunities to further 
    publicize and sell the game. Likewise, the game designers choose the 
    direction and focus of the updates, balancing all the things they want to 
    introduce. The PM and the game designers discuss and refine the specs until 
    everyone is satisfied with the plans for the next update. Meanwhile, the 
    Turbine producer makes sure that the work slated to be done for that month 
    stays within the development budget, and the testing teams make sure that 
    the update will not be too hard to test. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a deeply collaborative process, and 
    what comes of it is a spec better than any one group could have done on its 
    own. The updates are both a science and an art, both a business and a 
    performance. Each of the functional groups share a respect for the roles of 
    the others, and the goal, almost always achieved, is for everyone to be 
    happy with what is coming next to AC. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the developers create new code and content 
    as described by the spec, QA and MS Test start testing it out. They report 
    bugs and make suggestions. Soon they get help from the Fire Team. This work 
    gets increasingly intense. In the last week of testing, only quite serious 
    bugs will result in changes to the build, because any fix, no matter how 
    small, might break something else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then comes “prop day,” when the new build is 
    put on the public game servers. The Operations Staff shuts the worlds down 
    in the early hours of the morning and begins the process of updating all the 
    server files, which takes at least a few hours. Meanwhile, the Zone Staff 
    prepares the new client.exe file for download. The servers are started up 
    and checked, though players cannot yet enter the worlds. Once things look 
    good, the players are let back in. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then, we all watch and wait. We devour all 
    the news on the fansites and in the game chat. Any problems are either put 
    on the docket to fix next month or, in urgent cases, set up for a hotfix.
    </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How are the servers maintained and the worlds kept 
    going? </b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The AC datacenters are in Washington state, running on hardware leased by MS 
    from a major datacenter service provider. The Operations Staff manages new 
    props (see above) and maintains backups of critical data. Monitoring the 
    servers 24 hours a day, they also send alerts to the AC Team when there are 
    problems with the servers or the datacenter. They capture and report data as 
    requested by the programmers or producers, so the programmers can obtain 
    clues as to what may be affecting AC's performance. Some problems are in the 
    datacenter itself, such as problems with server or router hardware. Some 
    problems are bugs in the AC server code. Slow performance may be due to 
    general Internet lag, a datacenter overload, or due to the fact the AC 
    servers are simply doing too much work. All such problems are taken very 
    seriously. However, they are also the kinds of problems that are very hard 
    to diagnose and solve in a stable and effective manner, taking careful 
    iteration to improve over time. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How are new worlds brought into being? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Each game world's server is capable of doing a certain amount of work. The 
    more players there are online at once, the more work they need to do. When 
    the worlds approach peak populations high enough that they threaten to 
    overtax the servers, we start planning to bring a new world online. We are 
    also carefully pursuing code optimizations to get even better performance 
    out of the game servers we have, which helps us stay on budget. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>How is the AC website on the Zone updated? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    The text of the articles published on the AC website on the Zone can be 
    supplied by many sources within either MS or Turbine. An editor at MS works 
    with the PM to assure the quality and consistent messaging of the articles. 
    The editor uses tools supplied by the Zone Staff to publish new articles 
    online. The monthly newsletter is composed by similar means. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>What about all my other questions? </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    We hope that this article has been informative, but we know it may not 
    answer every question you have. As we see more questions come up in fansites 
    and game chat, we'll try to answer them here. Please be aware that if we 
    have anything officially true to say, we'll say it in a published article or 
    system message. Beware believing speculations or opinions you read online! 
    No single person ever has a complete picture; we try to get several AC 
    functional groups to buy into what we publish on the Zone to make sure we 
    inform you, our players, as fully as possible. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We all look forward to many more great 
    updates. We truly feel that Asheron's Call is improving all the time, and 
    that we continue to break new ground in the ORPG genre. We feel very lucky 
    and privileged to serve you by inviting you into our ever-changing fantasy 
    world. </font></p>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>
	</font> 
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">As she had every morning of her life thus 
    far, young Marta began the day clanging a bucket against her brother's 
    sleeping head.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Ow! All right, already. I'm up! I'm up!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Reggie! Come on! We have to get going. We have to go see--&quot; <br>
    <br>
    True, a painful way to greet the dawn, but Marta knew no other way to get 
    her brother out of bed. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>She needed to head down to Cragstone's nearby lake 
    to fetch the family's daily water.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;To do so here in Dereth, her parents 
    demanded she take along her older brother Reginald with her. However short 
    the journey, Reginald went armed with the family's sword and shield.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;Shallows Sharks proved dangerous enough, but these were also days of the 
    dread Hopeslayer. <br>
    <br>
    *** <br>
    <br>
    &quot;What now, Reggie?&quot; Marta knelt by the shore, her bucket filled with blood. 
    &quot;The water's all still red! We can't drink this.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Reginald stood guard nearby. His sword drawn, he kept his wary eyes on a 
    Tainted Golem shimmering further down the river. &quot;No one can,&quot; he said. 
    &quot;We'll have to leave it, and make due with what little we still have 
    stored.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Just then, both brother and sister turned their heads toward the crash of 
    resounding lightning. A palpable cloud of doom encroached upon Cragstone. At 
    the center of this cloud -- the dread Hopeslayer, Bael'Zharon. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Wait! Don't go!&quot; Marta ran after her brother, who'd started back to town. 
    Already the first sounds of battle, of spells cast to bolster defenders' 
    skills, the clash of running armor, carried through the air. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;No Marta! Just stay there -- hidden! I have to go bring father back his 
    sword!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    At that, the young man rushed off, forever leaving his sister behind. </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">THE CHILD OF DARALET<br>
    Our latest monthly update, &quot;The Child of Daralet,&quot; opened December 12th -- 
    and on that day, Bael'Zharon was unleashed upon the lands of Dereth! <br>
    <br>
    With the destruction of the final Soul Stone, the Shard of the Herald, 
    Bael'Zharon's mystic prison has been irrevocably shattered. 
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Seen gathering 
    his strength for much of last month, the Hopeslayer now walks abroad; and 
    with him, the world itself has changed. The rivers, the falling rain, even 
    water-constructed Golems flow with the crimson stain of blood=85 a telling 
    prelude to Bael'Zharon's attacks upon the towns. His spells have stripped 
    the flesh from defenders' bodies and thrust them to deadly heights above the 
    ground -- if for nothing more than to cruelly watch the heroes of Dereth 
    bleed, or fall, to death. <br>
    <br>
    Still, no calamity in Dereth is without its cure. The emissary of Asheron, 
    Boraelian Strathelar, has held desperate meetings with certain heroes, 
    discussing what must be done. Coupled with this knowledge, rumors abound of 
    a new quest, &quot;The Fall of the Hopeslayer,&quot; designed to confront Bael'Zharon. 
    However, it's also been said that heroes of every level will be needed to 
    complete this mission -- and possibly the help of Asheron himself! <br>
    <br>
    While Bael'Zharon proves the most telling addition to the game this month, 
    other features include a host of low-level quests. Centered around 
    mysterious scarlet red and lucky gold letters filtering into starter towns, 
    those heroes looking to learn much of Dereth would do wise to complete any 
    such quest. More information on the &quot;Society Letter Quests&quot; can be found at

    of the Riches</a></font>.&quot; With over a year of Asheron's Call, many bards in 
    the game have found the inspiration to write not only short stories, but 
    novel-length works as well! <br>
    <br>
    Be sure to keep contributing links to your stories. Please note, though, 
    that we cannot accept direct fiction submissions. However, if you run a fan 
    or an allegiance site, feel free to send in links to fiction pieces you 
    currently host. Again, URL addresses can be submitted for review to: 
    website@asheronscall.com; and, as always, content must be appropriate for 
    Microsoft's Zone or, regrettably, the piece cannot be included. <br>

    PORTAL SPACED<br>
    Oddly enough, the latest rumors about the dread Hopeslayer include the 
    following sightings: <br>
    <br>
    Shodan Xi wanders into the Leather Crafter's shop near Tou-Tou and !s as he 
    finds Bael'Zharon there. <br>
    <br>
    Bael'Zharon dons his newly acquired Ursuin Helmet and runs up to Shodan Xi.
    <br>
    <br>
    Bael'Zharon says, &quot;I AM A URSIN LOL!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Shodan Xi travels to Qalaba'r. <br>
    <br>
    Shodan Xi finds Bael'Zharon standing around in Qalaba'r. <br>
    <br>
    Bael'Zharon says, &quot;CAN NE1 OPEN PORTAL 2 ITHAENC CATHEDRAL PLZ? THX.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Our thanks to Jihad al-Fatwa, for posting the above sightings on the 
    Crossroads of Dereth. The full account, &quot;Bael'Zharon is loose! (And selling 
    armor in Kryst...)&quot; can be found <font face="Arial" size="2">

	TIPS</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">AC Tips has just updated its uber 
    chest guide. Silveran, of AC Tips, recently posted his thoughts, that some 
    of the best items in the game can only be found using Sturdy Iron Keys (SIK) 
    and in uber chests. But that SIKs &quot;are so hard to find and using them is 
    like lottery=85. So to find locations, monsters dropping keys, other chests 
    with similar or better loot=85 you can go right to our latest guide.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The AC Tips' uber chest guide may be found <font face="Arial" size="2">
