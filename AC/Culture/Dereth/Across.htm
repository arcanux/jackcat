	<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“In the 
	course of our travels to other worlds, it has become apparent that we are 
	not the only entities that are aware of the place that exists between these 
	worlds. It can be theorized that we are not the first race to pass through 
	these portal wells, nor will we be the last.” – Asheron Realaidain, Master 
	of the Lyceum at Knorr<br>
	</i><br>
	Wails grew louder and the little figured looked backward, tripped on a root, 
	and tumbled into the thick muck of the Blackmire Swamp. Though the nights 
	were warmer than they had been only weeks before, the night air was still 
	wintry. The creature’s muscles stiffened and his blood became as viscous as 
	the winter swamp about him. Another wail sounded and the mosswart clapped 
	his yellow-green hands over his ears and met the sound with a scream of his 
	own. His breath came in short gasps and his saucer eyes looked about wildly.
	<br>
	<br>
	“Dead all!” the little thing howled into the night. Crying and whimpering, 
	he grasped the roots of the nearby banyan tree and struggled to his feet. 
	The wail echoed through the swamp again, the sound of hundreds of claws 
	drawing across slate in perfect unison. Chills ran down the mosswart’s spine 
	and he pushed away from the tree and launched into a full sprint. His wide 
	feet sent the filth of the Blackmire into the air as he ran southeast from 
	his home.<br>
	<br>
	For hours Grearrk ran. Squealing, scampering, tumbling, running, covered in 
	filth and blood, driven by the panic and fear that had crept into his heart 
	as he slept and the horror that had nearly drained his soul when he woke. He 
	ran through the swamp, northwest toward the humans. They would help. The 
	Banderlings were as much an enemy to them as they were to the Mosswarts. 
	When the torches of Sawato became visible the panic in Grearrk’s heart began 
	to subside. He was filled with hope and pressed his little form even harder.<br>
	<br>
	Ite Kenzen had stepped out of his tavern to enjoy the first of what he hoped 
	would be several warm nights in Wintersebb, when he saw the yellow-brown 
	form charging toward him with large wild eyes. He yelped and tried to roll 
	to his right as the mosswart sprung upon him and toppled him to the ground.<br>
	<br>
	“Help won’t you, Grearrk! Help won’t you!” The mosswart screamed again and 
	again. Its little voice sounded hoarse. The creature lifted Ite to a sitting 
	position and then slid behind him, cowering and using his body as a shield. 
	Ite felt a wave of panic wash over him -- the mosswart was fleeing from 
	something and he was being used as a shield. As the creature’s voice fell to 
	a whimper, Ite began to scan the outskirts of the town for signs of what 
	happened. A patron came from the tavern and drew a sword. The mosswart 
	screeched and scurried beneath the steps of the establishment, bawling and 
	begging in broken Roulean.<br>
	<br>
	Ite, free of the creature’s grasp, stood and held a hand up toward the 
	adventurer. He shook his head and then spoke to the mosswart in a gentle 
	tone.<br>
	<br>
	“What happened?”<br>
	<br>
	“Wanga, without warning comes Wanga. Machine of screams is hidden in home. 
	Banderlings bring Wanga in screams. Very bad is new magic! Dead all, dead 
	all! Grearrk escape only. Help won’t you Grearrk?” The little creature 
	crouched on all fours and shifted left and right, wary that the 
	sword-wielding human would lash out him.<br>
	<br>
	Ite looked at the frightened creature and turned to adventurer. “Fetch a 
	guard for me.”<br>
	<br>
	“Hurt no, Grearrk. No weapons he brings. Hurt no, Grearrk,” the creature 
	sobbed.<br>
	<br>
	“I am going to help you, Grearrk.”<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	Ulgrim staggered along the roadside and smiled as he saw the broken 
	lifestone in the distance. Taking another pull from his ale he made his way 
	up the short incline and stared at the shards of blue. He dropped his stein 
	to ground. It landed with a thud and miraculously did not spill a drop. From 
	within the folds of his robe he produced a wand and started an incantation. 
	In the middle of the casting a belch escaped his lips and a scent of burning 
	hair was all that remained of the mage. Fortunately, he had grabbed his 
	brew.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	“I am sorry, Aulakhe, I have not heard from Lord Asheron in several weeks.” 
	Elysa sat beside the crouching Tumerok and spoke softly, trying to console 
	him. “If the place where the atua ngamaru are keeping Aun Tanua has become 
	unstable, I am sure that many will come to investigate.” The tumerok bowed 
	his head and shook it in agreement once.<br>
	<br>
	“Thank you, Ispar Elysatah. I will do my best to strengthen the will of 
	those in my akiekie.” He rose and turned to leave but stopped short as he 
	heard footsteps coming to the door.<br>
	<br>
	Antius pushed the door open and gave a half-bow and salute to Aun Aulakhe, 
	then turned his attention to Elysa. <br>
	<br>
	“It is true. The mosswart’s name is Grearrk. He’s resting now just outside 
	of Sawato. We looked over the structures he directed us to between Sawato 
	and the ruins of Yanshi.” He smiled lightly. “We found that there were 
	several mosswarts who were not attacked, but he spoke true. His hovel looked 
	like a massacre had taken place.” He passed Aulakhe and sat beside Elysa. 
	The Tumerok lightly beat the drum at his waist. “We searched the area 
	briefly; aside from the stench we could see nothing out of the ordinary.”<br>
	<br>
	“We shall see what the morning light brings,” Elysa said calmly and nodded 
	her head as she placed her hand atop Antius’.<br>
	<br>
	“Ispar Elysatah, Ispar Antiusnua, the spirits are agitated. Their words warn 
	of a terrible kah that comes to us all. They know fear,” Aun Aulakeh said in 
	a quiet tone.<br>
	<br>
	“Whatever that is, Aulakhe, we shall stand against it and set the spirits to 
	ease once again. Our Xuta’s will be strong, together.” Elysa smiled to 
	reassure the young Tumerok leader.<br>
	<br>
	*****<br>
	<br>
	As the sun began to rise over the Blackmire, a thin vine reached through the 
	surface of the swamp and promptly perished.</font></span></p>

	drawn across supple flesh presages the appearance of blood-soaked words. 
	There is no quill writing upon the page, nor is there light in this chamber, 
	far removed from the surface of the world. No footfalls in the hallways, no 
	being working over the tome, only a whisper of a woman’s voice endlessly 
	speaking, followed by the sound of bone carving the flesh of the book. So it 
	has been since the coming of the dark ones, since the world grew cold and 
	darkness consumed darkness while the light whimpered and watched its 
	children fall.<br>
	<br>
	The sun rises each morning. The moons come each night. Words ceaselessly 
	appear on the pages of this book. Auberean has survived by way of these 
	constants. But what happens to creation if the words one day…stop?<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">The Ongoing Saga<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	Dangers seem to be everywhere in Dereth these days. Zharalim working for the 
	Queen have gone rogue, and statues of the Hopeslayer have appeared in towns, 
	calling to Isparians to shrug off Asheron’s Protection.<br>
	<br>
	In the town of Sawato, near the Blackmire, a terrified mosswart fled some 
	unknown threat. Those who investigated found a massacre, with no hint as to 
	what could have caused such destruction. What new danger lurks just below 
	the surface of the fetid swamp?<br>
	<br>
	Many of this month’s changes have already been described in detail in the 
	Letter to the Players and the Follow-Up. There are three more topics that 
	we’d like to mention in detail.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><b>Portalspace and the Invoker<br>
	</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	This month, we’ve updated the Portalspace quest, including the Buadren and 
	the Invoker. The changes are intended to make the quest less confusing and 
	less likely to result in players getting stuck and unable to complete it. 
	The quest and the rewards have also been rebalanced. Here are the most 
	important changes:</font></span></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Players who have 
		become stuck in the past – generally through loss of the Ember – should 
		now be able to complete the quest successfully.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is no longer a 
		timer on creating a Buadren.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">All of the Buadren 
		parts have been renamed and moved onto new monsters. Since this is a 
		simple name change, if you currently have any Buadren part in your 
		possession, you can still use it to create a Buadren.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">None of the items 
		required to create a Buadren are Attuned or Bonded anymore, although the 
		Buadren itself is still Bonded and Attuned.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Portalspace / 
		Invoker part of the quest is now restricted to 70+.<br>
		You no longer have to attempt Portalspace within a month after having 
		created a Buadren. Aun Aulakhe will always remember that you’ve created 
		a Buadren.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Getting an Invoker is 
		now repeatable.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Invoker has been 
		upgraded. If you have an old Invoker, it will not be automatically 
		changed. However, you can trade it for a new Invoker by giving it to Aun 
		Saritea. If you trade for a new Invoker, you can never get the old 
		Invoker back.</font></span></li>
		<li><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Portalspace 
		dungeon has seen considerable changes.</font></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><b><font face="Arial">Yaraq<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	The other content revision this month is to the town of Yaraq. Yaraq has 
	been revised in the same way that Shoushi was in January, and Holtburg will 
	be in April. Portal drops and Lifestones have been moved, and the 
	surrounding content has been revised.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">In Concept / In Development<br>
	</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	We’re working on a better means of keeping you up-to-date on our development 
	activities. We don’t expect to give the full status on each topic in each 
	month’s Letter to the Players, we’d prefer to let you know which topics have 
	been changed or updated. We’ll most likely be adding permanent In Concept 
	and In Development pages to the official Asheron’s Call website.</font></span></p>

    <p><font size="2">Welcome to the March 2004 Letter to the Players! This 
    letter was initially intended for Monday, March 1st, but we held it so that 
    we could include additional comments regarding the treasure changes. 
    </p>
    <p><font size="2">In Dereth, we were reminded that not all threats to 
    civilization need come from outside. Near Zaikhal, an entire force of 
    Zharalim fell to corruption and madness, and strange small statues were 
    found in several towns, encouraging the citizens of Dereth to refuse 
    Asheron’s protection and battle one another.</p>
    <p><font size="2">Now let’s take a look at some of the changes coming in the 
    March event.<br>

    <div class="headlineMedium" style="width: 437; height: 19">
      <b>Treasure</b></div>
    </font><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">
    <p><font size="2">Last month, we introduced the first part of sweeping 
    changes to our treasure system, and we received a great deal of negative 
    feedback.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">One thing that the feedback made clear is that we failed 
    to properly prepare you for both the long-term and short-term impacts of the 
    change. In addition, your feedback has alerted us to a number of issues with 
    the change that we are working to resolve.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What is the long-term goal of these changes? Essentially, 
    it is to resolve a number of limitations in our loot system. The old loot 
    system had a number of issues. There were four generic levels of loot that 
    we could give to creatures intended for characters below level 50, but only 
    two levels of loot for characters above level 50. This made balancing loot 
    for the most uber characters very difficult – almost anything that we added 
    for the most difficult monsters would start appearing in monsters intended 
    for all 50+ characters. This was the largest flaw, but there were other 
    issues across the board.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Our goal is that creatures intended for a specific level 
    range should be more likely to drop loot that is useful for that level 
    range. For example, newbie characters should not find 325 wield req weapons 
    that they can’t use, and Uber characters should not find weapons with <i>no</i> 
    wield req. Also, there should be no creatures that always drop “useless 
    loot”. There will always be a range of loot, but that range should be more 
    reasonable than it has been in the past.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The first phase of our changes tied the six levels of loot 
    directly to the six target levels of characters that have existed in the 
    game for some time: Newbie (1-20), Low (20-40), Mid (40-60), High (60-80), 
    Extreme (80+), and Uber (100+). Creatures intended for characters in a 
    specific level range should drop loot appropriate for characters in that 
    level range. This improved loot overall for many creatures – many Tuskers 
    are a good example – but also decreased the average quality of loot found on 
    other creatures – such as many Olthoi. Many types of Olthoi had been given 
    loot well above their target level. This was good for players who just 
    wanted to loot a lot of peas easily, but was annoying for the players who 
    were intended to fight these Olthoi. These low-level players tended to get 
    weapons and items as loot that they wouldn’t be able to use for some time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">How do you know where to find creatures for your level? 
    The best place to look is at our Creature Distribution Map, which can be 
    found on our <a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=172">
    Download</a> page. This map shows how the creatures were laid out during the 
    landscape redistribution last year. The levels given are suggested player 
    levels, so that gives you a place to start hunting and see how it feels.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Now, just to be very clear about this – AC is a 
    skill-based game, not a level-based game. The ranges on that map are 
    suggestions based on assumptions we have made about average skill levels and 
    hunting styles. We suggest that you start with the range that that 
    corresponds to your level and see how you like it. If you've pumped more XP 
    into your combat skills, or if you like to live life out on the edge, you 
    may want to go up a range and see how that feels. If you have spread your 
    experience out more, or you're a more conservative sort, you may be happiest 
    trying out the range below your actual level. Our goal with this map was 
    merely to make some useful suggestions about where to start.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I cannot overemphasize the fact that the changes to 
    creatures <i>are not done yet</i>. Due to the size and scope of these 
    changes, it was not possible to make all of them in one month. As we 
    mentioned in last month’s Rollout Article, there are still a number of 
    issues. Some of these issues will be resolved in this month; others are 
    pending for April and later.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The following issues will be resolved in the March event:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Spell scrolls:</font></b><font size="2"> The scrolls 
      dropped by creatures haven’t been on-target for some time now, but the 
      February changes really exacerbated this issue. For March, we have 
      adjusted the scroll drops on creatures and in treasure – you should now 
      find scrolls that are appropriate for your level. Our goal is that you 
      should be able to find most of your scrolls for your next level before you 
      need to buy them. </font>
      <p><i><font size="2">Does this mean that there is a chance to find level 7 
      scrolls on creatures and in loot?</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2">Yes. Yes it does.</font></li>
      <li><b><font size="2">Spells on items: </font></b><font size="2">As we 
      said in the Rollout Article, spell levels on creatures intended for 80+ 
      characters were out of whack. After receiving your feedback on this issue, 
      we realized that the problem was more widespread. For March, we’ve 
      adjusted the spells on items upwards for all creatures and chests intended 
      for characters higher than 20. </font>
      <p><i><font size="2">Does this mean that there is a chance to find level 7 
      spells on loot items?</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2">Sorry, not at this time.</font></li>
      <li><b><font size="2">Chests:</font></b><font size="2"> Last month, we 
      concentrated primarily on creatures. This month, we’re turning our 
      attention to chests. Chests should now, in general, spawn items useful for 
      characters in the level range for which they are intended. </font>
      <p><font size="2">In addition, some chests have been adjusted so that they 
      have a chance of providing better loot than other sources within the same 
      target level range. Runed Chests and the Virindi Troves are good examples 
      of this.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The Singularity Trove deserves its own comment. The 
      Singularity Trove used to be in the class with the best possible loot in 
      the game – but the troves and keys could be found by characters at a lower 
      level. The Singularity Trove is now in the 80+ target range of loot.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">At the moment though, the 80+ and the 100+ ranges have a 
      lot of overlap. In addition, many of the issues that were reported with 
      Singularity Troves in February – such as scroll levels and weapon 
      modifiers – will be resolved this month.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Offense and Defense Modifiers: </font></b>
      <font size="2">In all cases, we’ve increased the average offense and 
      defense modifier on melee weapons. We’ve also increased the maximum mod 
      that can be found at each level – except the top level, which was already 
      the maximum possible. This change was made primarily as a result of player 
      feedback.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">The following issue should be resolved in the April event:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Border Creatures:</font></b><font size="2"> Right 
      now, if a creature is intended for level 60 characters, it will have loot 
      for level 40-60. This can make it very challenging to “break in” to the 
      next level of creatures – you can’t fight stronger creatures without 
      getting better equipment, but you can’t get better equipment without 
      fighting stronger creatures! </font>
      <p><font size="2">Starting in April, creatures that are designed for 
      characters within 5 levels of a difficulty break will have the treasure 
      intended for the next highest difficulty. For example, creatures that are 
      intended to be fought by level 36 characters will have loot intended for 
      characters from 40 to 60. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In addition, some creatures that are completely outside 
      the system will be brought in, and other creatures will be adjusted as 
      necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">It is important to remember that a creature’s level is
      <i>not</i> a direct correlation to the level of character that should be 
      fighting it. In general, you should be able to take on creatures that are 
      higher level than you are. When we rebalanced creatures last year we tried 
      to line up the display level so that there is an obvious relationship 
      between that and difficulty – so that a level 110 monster is harder than a 
      level 100 monster. However, some creatures are easier for one type of 
      character – mages, say – and harder for another – melee, say. So if you're 
      a melee, a level 100 mage-oriented creature may be tougher for you than a 
      level 110 melee-oriented creature.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">The following issue will be resolved in a future update:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Armor:</font></b><font size="2"> The type and 
      qualities of armor found in the various levels of loot are out of whack. 
      This is one of the reasons why you’re finding AL20 leather at much higher 
      creature levels than you would expect. We’re aware of this issue and are 
      working on it, but the changes will not be in March, nor are they likely 
      for April. </font>
      <p><i><font size="2">Does balancing armor include introducing new types of 
      armor?</font></i></p>
      <p><font size="2">Probably, yes.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">Another issue that has resulted in a great deal of 
    feedback is the value of items – many players have reported difficulty in 
    making enough pyreals through hunting to pay for their components, mana 
    charges, and other consumables. We are watching the situation closely, but 
    at this time we have no plans to directly change the value of loot items. 
    Many of the other changes that we are making – both in treasure and 
    elsewhere – may change the situation considerably. In particular, the scroll 
    changes may resolve the issues reported with mages not being able to afford 
    scrolls that they needed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">We understand that a large number of you were very 
    surprised and upset by these changes. We believe that this was caused by two 
    main factors. The first is that the changes are not complete, and you are 
    seeing an incomplete system at work. The second is that I personally did not 
    properly explain the goals and phases of these changes – I hope that this 
    letter explains things to your satisfaction.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    </font></font></font><font size="3">
    <div class="headlineMedium">
      <b>Armor Buffing, Transfer Spells, and Arcs</b></div>
    </font><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">
    <p><font size="2">What do these topics have in common? The two changes are 
    being made primarily from a PvP point of view, but they also impact NPK 
    players.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2">Armor Buffing</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">In the past, there has been no means of buffing or 
    debuffing another player’s armor.&nbsp; Negative armor Item Enchantment spells 
    such as Lures or Brittlemail were only useful on a target wielding a 
    shield.&nbsp; PK and PKL players have never had a means of countering, or 
    “breaking through,” the positive effects cast upon an opposing player’s 
    armor. Starting in March, you will now be able to do so – with some 
    limitations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Beginning in March, Item Enchantment armor buffs or 
    debuffs cast upon a player <i>who is not wielding a shield</i> will redirect 
    to whatever armor is worn on that player’s chest. If the player is not 
    wearing armor, the spell will fail. Clothing, such as a shirt or Asheron’s 
    Raiment, does not count in this situation – but robes do, as they are 
    considered armor. When cast on a player wielding a shield, these spells will 
    redirect to his or shield, as they have for several months now. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This allows for several new options for players. NPK 
    players can assist a friend with armor buffing, so long as their friend is 
    not wielding a shield. However, we expect these changes will be most useful 
    to PKs and PKLs, who can now debuff the armor of their opponents.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">It is important to note that the dynamics associated with 
    buffing or debuffing a target’s armor will work similarly to that of a 
    target’s shield or weapon.&nbsp; If the targeted item is not wielded at the time 
    the spell is cast, the spell will fail.&nbsp; If the targeted item is 
    unenchantable, the spell will also fail.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This change is intended to provide a method to directly 
    counter the ability to debuff another player’s weaponry.&nbsp; Without the 
    ability to negate a player’s positive armor Item Enchantment spells, it was 
    often very difficult for a melee or missile attacker to inflict meaningful 
    damage on an opponent. A player could always debuff a weapon, tilting the 
    combat advantage in his or her favor – yet the player using a physical 
    attack had no equivalent tactic available.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2">Transfer Spells</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">For some time, the low-level transfer spells have been 
    unbalanced at high levels, and not as effective as hoped at the low levels 
    for which they were designed. For example, a high level mage can often cast 
    Stamina to Health I and restore almost all – if not all – of his health. 
    This seems inappropriate for a first-level spell. Why is it so much better 
    than Heal Self I, for example?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Let us define what is meant by Life Magic transfer spells: 
    &nbsp;Health to Mana, Health to Stamina, Mana to Stamina, Mana to Health, Stamina 
    to Health, and Stamina to Mana are all of the spells that we consider to be 
    part of the Life Magic transfer class of spells.&nbsp; These spells traditionally 
    take a portion of one secondary attribute (health, mana, or stamina), and 
    convert some amount of that portion into a different secondary attribute.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Starting in March, the first three levels of transfer 
    spells will have their percentage returned increased, to improve their value 
    for low-level characters. In addition, to reduce the imbalance issue, the 
    first four levels of transfer spells will have their maximum transfer 
    capped. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2">“Maximum Transfer” refers to the maximum value <i>either</i> 
    drained or converted. For example, Stamina to Health I, when cast by a 
    character with 150 Stamina, used to drain 75 points of Stamina and provide 
    56 points of Health. Now, it will only drain 50 points of Stamina, and 
    provide 45 points of Health. No level I transfer spell will drain <i>or </i>
    provide more than 50 points of any pool.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">This change is intended to increase the value and usage of 
    low-level transfer spells for low-level characters, while decreasing their 
    power when used by high-level characters.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2">Arc Spell Words</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">Since their introduction, arc spells have used the same 
    spell words as bolt spells, due to the fact that they use the same 
    components when not using Foci. For example, both Flame Bolt and Flame Arc 
    use the words <i>Zojak Quaguz.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In today’s PvP arena, this means that one aspect of player 
    skill – knowing what the spell words mean so you can know what your opponent 
    is casting at you – cannot be used when trying to distinguish Bolts from 
    Arcs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Starting in March, Arcs will have a different formula – 
    they will use Amaranth instead of Hawthorn. Players who use Foci will not 
    notice a difference – they will still use prismatic tapers and scarabs – but 
    the spells will now have <i>Kedrack</i> as their first word instead of <i>
    Zojak.</i> If you aren’t using the War Magic Foci, you will need to buy 
    Amaranth before you will be able to cast Arc spells.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">So now, if you see your opponent say <i>Zojak Quaguz</i>, 
    you will know that he’s casting a bolt and not an arc.</font></p>

      <b><font size="2">Additional PvP Concerns for the Future</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">As we stated in the February Letter to the Players, we are 
    taking a closer look at a number of PK and PKL issues. In the near future, 
    you may see changes to:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font size="2">The lack of an Aegis-like ability for archers. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font size="2">The balance of dispels – dispel spells, gems, and 
      potions. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">The Jumpspin issue – how can we prevent players from 
      using our physics code to guarantee escape from sticky melee, and yet 
      still provide a means for skilled players to get away from the melee that 
      is targeting them? </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Melee weapon damage over time in PvP – specifically, 
      bringing more diversity to melee beyond “if you’re not sword, you’re out 
      of luck”. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">“Loot Weapons” vs. “Quest Weapons” – Re-examining PK-oriented 
      quest weapon suites to provide viable choices between the different types 
      of weaponry </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">New/Improved pathing choices for missile attacks, 
      similar to the arc/bolt choice for War Magic</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">I can’t provide a specific ETA for any of these changes, 
    but we want to let you know what we are working on. The feedback threads 
    that we’ve run on our forums have given us a lot of great information about 
    what you do and don’t like about PvP combat in Asheron’s Call. We’ll be 
    using that information to make PvP better for the folks who play it most.<br>

      <b>Content Revisions</b></div>
    </font><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">
    <p><font size="2">In March we are continuing our ongoing process of updating 
    out-of-date quests and areas. This month, you’ll see Yaraq and its 
    surroundings receive an update similar to Shoushi’s update in January. The 
    Invoker, or Portalspace, quest will also be updated.<br>

      <b>Fellowships and Quests</b></div>
    </font><font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">
    <p><font size="2">One of the new quests this month has as a key part of it a 
    quest dynamic that you’ve not seen before – fellowship quests and “locked” 
    fellowships. A fellowship quest means that your whole fellowship is on the 
    quest, not just an individual. If you drop out of the fellowship, you will 
    not be able to complete the quest. A “locked” fellowship is one in which new 
    members cannot be recruited for the length of the quest. Fellowship members 
    who leave the group have 15 minutes to get back in before they are unable to 
    rejoin.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Please, <i>don’t</i> take these changes as an indication 
    that we are removing Asheron’s Call’s soloability! The ability to advance 
    while playing alone is one of Asheron’s Call’s strengths, and we have no 
    intention of removing it. However, in certain special circumstances or for 
    specific quests, we may use these new features to ensure that the quest be 
    tackled by a group of players.<br>

    <b><a name="lttp2"></a>Letter to the Players Follow-Up&nbsp;- </b>
    
    <font face="Arial">From the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=211">
    Turbine Site</a> </font>
    <p>In listening to the feedback received since posting the Letter to the 
    Players, we’ve realized that there are some gaps in our communication 
    process. One of the largest of these is that frequently players are not 
    advised of changes included in an upcoming month until the Letter to the 
    Players for that month is posted. Because of our schedule, this means that 
    by the time we are seeing your reaction to planned changes, we are already 
    in a freeze state in which altering or reverting those changes are very 
    difficult.</p>
    <p>I’d like to apologize for not taking further steps to prevent all of you 
    from being blindsided by some of our upcoming changes. More to the point, 
    we’re making some big changes to the way we release information about 
    upcoming updates. We’ll be releasing information farther ahead of time, 
    which will allow us to listen to your feedback and discuss these concepts 
    and ideas with you long before we begin development on them.</p>
    <p>In addition to this article, we plan to provide in-depth articles 
    regarding several large-scale systems and our visions for them. The first of 
    these, regarding PvP combat, should be posted early next week. The second 
    will be regarding the Treasure changes and will follow a week or so later. 
    The third will talk about our plans to improve the buffing process and will 
    probably follow a week after the Treasure article.</p>
    <p>Each Letter to the Players will now have three sections. The first 
    section is going to contain information about the upcoming month. The second 
    section, <b>“In Development,”</b> will contain information about what we are 
    working on for the next month. The third section, <b>“In Concept,”</b> is 
    going to contain information about changes that we are working on for later 
    updates. This will give you more information about future changes and more 
    opportunity to provide feedback on these changes before we even write a 
    single line of code. Only changes to existing game systems will be included 
    in these updates; in general we will not release information about upcoming 
    content.</p>
    <p>It is important to stress that nothing in the <b>&quot;In Development&quot;</b> or
    <b>&quot;In Concept&quot;</b> is final. These are all works in progress. Nothing in 
    either section is guaranteed to go into the game in the form described, or 
    even at all. The purpose of these sections is to find out how you feel about 
    these topics before they are final.</p>
    <p>Rather than explain in further detail, you can see exactly what I mean 
    below. We wanted to get this information about April and beyond up as soon 
    as possible, as many of the changes you’ll see below directly impact many of 
    the concerns that were raised regarding the March Letter to the Players.</p>
    </font></font></font></span></font><span lang="en-us">
    <font size="3">
    <p>
    <b>Coming in March</b></font><font size="2"><p><i>(These are items that are 
    coming in the March event. In the past, we would have saved this information 
    for the March Rollout Article. Under the new communication system, they are 
    appropriate for the Letter to the Players.)</i><p><b>“Hidden” Properties No 
    Longer Hidden</b><p>There are several quest weapons, such as the 
    Quadruple-Bladed Axe, that have what we’ve referred to in the past as a 
    “hidden property”. Starting in March, these properties will appear when you 
    ID such an item.</p>
    <p>An item that is described as having the <b>Biting Strike</b> property has 
    a greater chance of a critical hit in combat. An item that is described as 
    having the <b>Crushing Blow</b> property has a greater than normal critical 
    multiplier – it is likely to do more damage in a critical hit.</p>
    <p>Unlike imbues, these properties do not scale with your skill; they are 
    set to a specific level. </p>
    <p><b>Character Options</b><p>Over the years, we’ve added several options to 
    the Character Options panel. The grouping of these options was, well, 
    counterintuitive at times. Starting in March, the options will be grouped 
    under the following headers: <i>User Interface Behavior, User Interface 
    Display, Grouping, Other Players, Character Behavior, </i>and <i>Chat</i>.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, we’re adding several new options – Character Display 
    Options, and Crafting Confirmation.</p>
    <p><b>Character Display Options</b><p>These options will be found under <i>
    Other Players</i> and control what other players can see if they 
    successfully assess you. The different pieces of information that you can 
    toggle on or off are:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Your real-time date of birth. </li>
      <li>Your in-game age. </li>
      <li>Your chess rank. </li>
      <li>Your fishing skill. </li>
      <li>Your number of deaths.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these options are toggled off by default.</p>
    <p><b>Crafting Confirmation</b><p>This is something that has been requested 
    several times, and we’re happy to be able to provide it. Starting in March, 
    there will be a new option in the Character Options panel under <i>User 
    Interface Display:</i> “Crafting Chance of Success Dialog.”</p>
    <p>This option is unchecked by default. If you leave it unchecked, all 
    crafting interactions, including Tinkering, behave as they have in the past. 
    Most interactions simply either succeed or fail, while some interactions – 
    mostly Tinkering – have a warning in advance.</p>
    <p>If you check this option, any existing warnings will not be shown. 
    Instead, you will make the “clapping” motion and the following will occur:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>If you have a 100% chance of success in this craft interaction, it 
      will succeed.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>If you have a 0% chance of success in this craft interaction, it will 
      automatically abort and you will receive the message, “<i>You cannot 
      possibly succeed”</i> in the upper-left.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>If your odds of success are somewhere between 0% and 100%, you will 
      receive a dialog box stating your odds and asking you if you want to 
      continue. If you choose to continue, the interaction will either succeed 
      or fail as it has in the past. If you choose not to continue, the craft 
      interaction will abort and you will receive the message, <i>“You chicken 
      out”</i> in the upper-left.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obviously, few crafters will leave the option permanently checked or 
    unchecked. If you’re making flour and your odds are, say, 95%, you probably 
    want to leave it unchecked. On the other hand, if you’re tinkering your best 
    weapon with Black Garnet, you probably want to check the option so you have 
    an idea what your odds are.</p>
    <p><b>Ulgrim</b><p>We want to warn you in advance that Ulgrim won’t be found 
    in his house immediately after the March event. Don’t worry, he’s not gone 
    for good! He’s just run into a bit of trouble – see the
    <a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=210">teaser</a>. 
    You’ll be seeing more of Ulgrim later in the month, and you’ll be able to 
    complete the quest in his house again before the month is over.</font><font size="3"><p>
    <b>In Development</b></font><font size="2"><p><i>(These are the game changes 
    that we are working on for the April event. None of these items are 
    guaranteed to be added for April, as scheduling and priorities can change. 
    Once the process has matured over the next two months or so, In Development 
    will contain items from the In Concept section that we’ve discussed with you 
    and decided to put in the development pipeline. There is no set schedule for 
    In Development items to go into an episode; this section only notes that 
    they are being worked on.</i></p>
    <p><i>As this is the first month for this section, it contains the work for 
    April and your feedback on these topics would be particularly valuable.)</i></p>
    </font>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Settlement Portals</b></font><p><font size="2">For some 
    time, the Settlement Portal Hubs have been found outside almost all of the 
    towns and cities of Dereth. These Hubs provided fast transportation all 
    across Dereth, but many players have complained that... well, they just look 
    ugly. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In April, we are planning to introduce the first phase of 
    a two-phase process to remove the Settlement Portals. The first phase is the 
    creation of portal summoning gems for all of the Settlements that are 
    currently linked to the Hubs. Each Settlement will have a vendor who will 
    sell that Settlement’s gem. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The second phase, currently planned for May, is the 
    removal of the Settlement Portal Hubs entirely. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The goal of these changes is to remove the ugliness of the 
    Hubs, as well as encourage exploration and travel through Dereth’s 
    wilderness. If there are several Settlements that you visit regularly, you 
    have the opportunity to purchase gems for these Settlements in the month of 
    April, before the Hubs are removed. If you wish to visit your friend’s home, 
    you can ask you friend to purchase that Settlement’s gem for you. We would 
    not be surprised to see gems for particularly popular Settlement 
    destinations being traded in the Marketplace!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Content Revisions</b></font><p><font size="2">We plan 
    to revise two towns and two quests in April. Holtburg will be revised in the 
    same way that Shoushi was in January and Yaraq will be in March. The portal 
    drops and Lifestone locations will be made more convenient, and the 
    surrounding content will be adjusted for balance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The second town that we are planning to revise is the 
    Lugian fortress of Linvak Tukal. It will be getting a Lifestone and direct 
    portal access, without the need to fight through the entryway.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Along with Linvak Tukal, we plan to revise the Arm, Heart, 
    Mind quest. Confusing aspects of the quest timing will be fixed, and the 
    quest rewards will be adjusted.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The second quest to be revised is the Little Green Seeds 
    quest. Terese’s interactions and the Swamp Garden will be revised, and new 
    types of seeds for higher-level creatures will be introduced. This doesn’t 
    mean new colors of dye, however.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Vendor Buy-Sell Rates</b></font><p><font size="2">Ever 
    since the creature spawn changes, there have been some disparities between 
    the difficult of hunting around certain towns and the buy-sell rates of the 
    vendors inside those towns. In April, we plan to adjust the vendor buy-sell 
    rates in several towns to better reflect the surrounding area.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In addition, to give each town some unique flavor, each 
    town will have one or two vendors who have better buy/sell rates than the 
    rest of the town. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Dispel Revisions</b></font><p><font size="2">For some 
    time, the dispel gems have been considerably better than any of the dispel 
    spells or dispel potions. Dispel gems could remove all of your debuffs in 
    one shot, they only removed negative spells, and they could remove level VII 
    spells.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To improve the situation and create more versatility and 
    usefulness for dispels, we are planning to add level VIIs to spells and 
    potions, and decrease the power of gems:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Dispel spells:</font></b><font size="2"> There will 
      be level VII versions of Item, Creature, and Life dispels, both Self and 
      Other. These spells will remove a random number of negative spells from 
      the target when successfully cast, and will not remove positive spells.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Dispel potions:</font></b><font size="2"> There will 
      be level VI and VII player-craftable dispel potions, which will be created 
      in a process similar to the existing dispel potions. One option we are 
      considering is the removal of the two lowest levels of dispel potions and 
      shifting the entire crafting process “down” two steps. For example, the 
      process that currently results in a level V dispel potion would now create 
      a level VII dispel potion.</font><p><font size="2">These potions will 
      remove a random number of negative spells from the user, and will not 
      remove positive spells.</font></li>
      <li><b><font size="2">Dispel gems:</font></b><font size="2"> These gems 
      will have their power reduced. They will no longer remove all negative 
      spells from the user, they will instead remove a random number. We are 
      also looking at the possibility of making them stackable.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">In general, when I write, “a random number” above, the 
    final random range has not yet been finalized. We’re looking at a range of 
    or near 1-6 spells for each dispel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Buffing Improvements</b></font><p><font size="2">The 
    Buffing Changes article that will be following will provide information on 
    all of our planned buffing improvements and how they fit together. The first 
    of these, faster self-buffs, is planned for April.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In April, we plan to make all Creature and Life Self buffs 
    cast at the same speed as a level I spell, no matter what their level. This 
    should cut down on the amount of time spent preparing for battle for players 
    who cast their own buffs. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Why the Self spells and not Others? We believe that 
    training a skill yourself should always have some advantage over relying on 
    others who have trained the skill. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">What about Banes? As there are no “Self” or “Other” 
    versions of these spells, we need to be a bit more careful about our changes 
    to them. You’ll see some information regarding our plans for Banes in the <b>
    In Concept</b> section below, as well as in the coming Buffing Changes 
    article.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>House Purchase Timer</b></font><p><font size="2">An 
    issue that has resulted in a great deal of feedback is that of players 
    camping houses solely for the purpose of resale and a profit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After receiving all of your feedback, we've come at this 
    issue from a different angle. If we can prevent these players from being 
    able to quickly unload these houses and purchase new ones, it will impede 
    their ability to tie up the entire housing market.<br>
    <br>
    To that end, we would like to introduce a one month timer on purchasing 
    cottages, villas, and mansions. Residential Quarters will be exempt from 
    this timer. This timer is per account, not per character. The timer would 
    not extend across worlds.<br>
    <br>
    What does this mean? All players, whether they own a house or not, would 
    have a field in their housing panel stating the last time that they 
    purchased a house (for these purposes a &quot;house&quot; is a cottage, villa, or 
    mansion) and when they can purchase another one. You cannot purchase a house 
    until 30 days after the last time that you purchased a house.<br>
    <br>
    It is important to note that this has nothing to do with when you lose a 
    house, either through @house abandon or failure to pay maintenance. If you 
    have owned a house for several months and abandon it, you will be able to 
    purchase another house immediately. What you cannot do is purchase a house, 
    abandon it less than 30 days later, and then purchase another house 
    immediately.<br>
    <br>
    Purchasing an apartment in the Residential Quarters does not change this at 
    all. You could buy a house, immediately abandon it, and then immediately 
    purchase an apartment. However you would still have to wait the 30 days 
    before you could purchase another house.<br>
    <br>
    There is a feedback thread on this specific proposal
    <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.ac.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3756">
    here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Treasure Changes, Phase 3</b></font><p><font size="2">
    We’ve already mentioned several of the ongoing Treasure changes coming in 
    April in the March Letter to the Players, such as adjustments to border 
    creatures. In addition, we plan to make the following changes:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font size="2">Attack and Defense modifiers will appear more 
      frequently on weapons. In March, we’re adjusting the minimum, maximum, and 
      average modifiers that are found – in April, you will find these modifiers 
      more frequently in general.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font size="2">Mana Conversion modifiers will also appear more 
      frequently on casters. At high levels of loot, you will no longer be able 
      to find casters that <i>don’t</i> have a Mana Conversion modifier. In 
      addition, the average Mana Conversion modifier will adjusted upwards.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">New Defense Modifiers</font></b><font size="2">. In 
      April, you will be able to find Melee Defense modifiers on casting items, 
      and Missile Defense and Magic Defense modifiers on all weapons and casting 
      items. Casters will now be able to have Defender cast on them, as well as 
      be tinkered with Brass. At some point in the future we may create 
      equivalent spells and tinkers for Missile Defense and Magic Defense 
      modifiers on weapons and casters.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><font size="2">Casting items will have the ability to generate with 
      Defender due to the above change, and will also have the ability to 
      generate with the Hermetic Link spell or cantrips for any of the spells 
      that can be found on them.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><font size="2">“Second-class” Weapons Get Upgrades</font></b><p>
    <font size="2">In the past, some weapons within a weapon class were just 
    plain undesirable. For example, if you were a Mace user and you wanted 
    maximum damage, there was no reason to look at anything other than a 
    Morningstar. You turned up your nose at a Kasrullah.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In April, we’ll be making changes to bring the low-end 
    damage weapons closer to par with the maximum damage weapons in each class. 
    This is similar to the changes we made to bows and crossbows last year; 
    however we are not necessarily giving all weapons within a class the same 
    maximum damage. In many weapon classes there will still be weapons that have 
    a lower maximum than others, but the difference will be much smaller. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2">No weapon class is having its maximum damage increased, 
    and some classes are being changed more than others. For example, all three 
    types of Unarmed Combat weapons had the same maximum damage, so they will 
    not be touched. Weapons that are considered to be a “secondary damage type” 
    – Rapiers, Spiked Clubs, Naginatas, and Warhammers – are not being changed, 
    and we are taking into account the differences between hiltable and non-hiltable 
    Swords and Daggers.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2">Fellowship Spells</font></b><p><font size="2">As we 
    have hinted in the past, we are introducing spells that can be cast on all 
    members of a fellowship simultaneously. The first of these spells are 
    planned for April. We are taking it slow with these – they are only 
    attribute buffs, and no more powerful than existing spells.</font><p><b>
    <font size="2">Envoy Policy Changes</font></b><p><font size="2">Katahdin is 
    working with the Dev Team to help the Envoy team better assist you, our 
    players. Here are two of the ideas that we are currently considering:</font></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li><b><font size="2">Inscriptions.</font></b><font size="2"> While their 
      primary responsibility would always to be handle calls that are in the 
      Help or Abuse queues, Envoys could make themselves available to uninscribe 
      items upon request. There would also be scheduled times and places on each 
      world where you could find an Envoy to uninscribe your item. We’re still 
      working on many of the details and are interested in your thoughts on this 
      topic.</font></li>

      issues for players who are portaling in to the Marketplace. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">The Envoy team would like to encourage players to move 
    their bots into the outer rooms of the Marketplace. In addition, players 
    need to ensure that the speech that they are having their trade bots use is 
    not offensive. We are considering removing offensive or badly-placed trade 
    bots from the Marketplace. These bots would not be banned or booted, but 
    would be removed to isolated rooms until their owners return.</font></p>

    <p><b>In Concept</b><p><i><font size="2">(These are the game additions and 
    changes that we are thinking about for May and beyond. We cannot guarantee 
    that any of these additions and changes will be added to the game. The whole

    give you a chance to comment and to have a dialogue with us about them.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2">I can’t stress strongly enough – it is entirely 
    possible that <b>none</b> of the changes listed below will ever make it into 
    the game. We are going to be carefully watching what you post about these 
    concepts.)</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2"><b>Content Revisions</b><p>In the future, we would like to 
    revisit all towns in the same fashion that Shoushi has been revisited, and 
    Yaraq and Holtburg will be revised in March and April respectively. </p>
    <p>We also would like to revise the difficulty and rewards of Marae Lassel, 
    Aerlinthe, and the Vesayens in the same way that we revised the Singularity 
    Caul. In each case the island and associated quests would be revised for new 
    (not necessarily higher) target levels.</p>
    <p>We would like to revise the following quests: Palenqual’s Living Weapons, 
    Singularity Weapons, the “Three Crystals Quests” (aka the Fenmalain, 
    Caulnalain, and Shendolain Vaults), the Quiddity Weapons, and the Composite 
    Bow and Crossbow.</p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b>Better Weapons</b><p>In discussing the Treasure changes, we’ve 
      mentioned that one of the reasons that the changes were necessary was to 
      allow us to add cool new loot at the top end. What are we thinking of? 
      We’re thinking of higher wield-req melee and missile weapons and wield-req 
      casting items. To prevent these new items from throwing off existing 
      damage-over-time balance, as well as PvP balance, we are looking at 
      possibilities other than simply increased damage. One possibility is new, 
      special imbue effects that cannot be added through tinkering, or – for the 
      missile weapons and casters – special bonuses to specific types of 
      elemental damage.</p>
      <p><b>New Loot Armor</b></p>
      <p>Right now the loot system has some rather obvious flaws when it comes 
      to armor, such as when a high-level creature drops AL20 leather. We have 
      held off on adjusting the armor drop system as we are looking at a 
      complete revamp of it including new types of armor. We’re looking at 
      adding a new class of armor for each of the three races. These new types 
      would not be considerably better than existing armor, but would mix up the 
      existing racial armor stereotypes. For example, perhaps the new Aluvian 
      armor has metal protections like Celdon, but is a two-piece set like Amuli? 
      These questions are still being investigated.</p>
      <p>If it appears that we will have to delay the introduction of the new 
      armor, we can look at adjusting the armor drop tables without them. We 
      would prefer not to, but we understand that you would prefer to stop 
      finding AL20 armor in non-low-level loot as soon as possible.</p>
      <p><b>Rares</b></p>
      <p>Rares would be an entirely new type of loot drop, separate from 
      existing loot and trophies. Rares would have an extremely small chance of 
      dropping from any creature, at any time – you would be just as likely to 
      find a Rare on a Drudge Prowler as you would on a Virindi Profatrix. </p>
      <p>Rares would be designed to be useful to almost any character, but not 
      better in way that could be unbalancing. For example, we are considering a 
      Rare form of healing kit that has interesting properties with regards to 
      chances of healing and the amount healed. We would probably not consider a 
      Rare sword that has a base damage triple existing swords. </p>
      <p>Rares are intended to be exciting and interesting semi-unique items. 
      When you find a Rare, we want your reaction to immediately be, “Cool!” no 
      matter which Rare it is.</p>
      <p>One interesting note – to help us determine what the drop rate on Rares 
      might be, we decided to find out exactly how many creatures are killed by 
      our players in a given month. We added code to the game that would count 
      this for us! In the time between the January and February events, here are 
      how many creatures each world killed:</p>
      <p>Darktide: 13.5 million<br>
      Harvestgain: 10.4 million<br>
      Frostfell: 10.1 million<br>
      Wintersebb: 9.2 million<br>
      Leafcull: 8.9 million<br>
      Solclaim: 8.8 million<br>
      Thistledown: 8.8 million<br>
      Morningthaw: 8.4 million</p>
      <p>We won’t be doing these counts every month, but it’s some interesting 
      information to think about!</p>
      <p>More information on the above three Treasure topics may be found in the 
      upcoming Treasure article.</p>
      <div class="headlineSmall">
        <b>Further Buffing Improvements</b></div>
      <p>In addition to accelerated self buffs and Fellowship spells, we are 
      looking at introducing spells that buff multiple attributes 
      simultaneously. These spells could be introduced for Life, Creature, 
      and/or Item Magic. The exact details of these spells – how do you learn 
      them, what is the cost, how <i>many</i> attributes do they buff 
      simultaneously – are still in development.</p>
      <p>More information on this topic will be in the upcoming Buffing 
      Improvements article.</p>
      <p><b>Missile Attack Improvements</b></div>
    <p>We are investigating two improvements for Bow, Crossbow, and Thrown 
    Weapons characters:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Recalibrating the accuracy/speed slider. Currently setting the slider 
      to the far left allows you to fire at maximum speed, but penalizes your 
      skill by 50%. Likewise, setting the slider to the far right gives you a 
      50% bonus to your skill, but fires at the slowest rate.<p>We are 
      investigating the possibility of adjusting this slider to allow for 
      fastest speed with a smaller penalty – or no penalty – without changing 
      the bonus given at slowest speed.</li>
      <li>A new pathing type for missile attacks. War Mages have the ability to 
      choose between Bolts and Arcs for the purposes of targeting, whereas 
      missile users have only one option. We are investigating the possibility 
      of giving archers a pathing option. This would likely be either through 
      some sort of option in the attack bar, or through a new form of 
      ammunition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Town Improvements</b></p>
    <p>We are investigating several ideas to increase the appeal of towns and 
    increase the number of players that can be found in towns at any given time. 
    Some of these ideas include some form of crafting bonus that can only be 
    found in towns, or some form of capture-and-hold dynamic to appeal to PK and 
    PKL players.</p>
    <p><b>Allegiance Improvements</b></p>
    <p>We’re investigating a number of improvements to Allegiances in general. 
    Some of these include allegiance officers with titles, more controls on who 
    can and cannot enter an allegiance (such as account bans), better chat 
    functions and controls, and the ability to name your Allegiance.</p>
    <p><b>Mansion Improvements</b></p>
    <p>We’re well aware that many players feel that Mansions are not worth their 
    maintenance cost, and we are working on several ideas to make Mansions more 
    valuable. Most of these are special hookable objects similar to Jojii’s 
    Font.</p>
    <p><b>PvP Changes</b></p>
    <p>A number of the above topics touch on PvP combat, but there are other 
    topics that are specifically focused on PvP:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Adjustments to the damage-over-time of the PvP weapon suites: Hollow 
      weapons, Phantom weapons, and Weeping weapons. These adjustments would be 
      intended to improve the viability of non-sword melee classes, as well as 
      improve balance overall.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>A resolution to the Jumpspin issue. There should be a way for skilled 
      players to, in some way, get away from a melee that is “stuck” to them. 
      However the ability to indefinitely jump and spin, throwing off the 
      melee’s client prediction, is not the answer. The final solution on this 
      issue should also resolve the PvP jumping stamina penalty issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Housing barriers on Darktide. We are investigating possibilities 
      regarding this issue. Some of these include removing all housing barriers, 
      removing only mansion and villa barriers, or applying the PK timer to the 
      house barrier in some way. Other suggestions, such as allowing the barrier 
      to be temporarily destroyed in some way, appear to be too difficult to 
      implement in the foreseeable future.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Points, areas, locations, or the like to fight over. The first attempt 
      at this was found in the February event, and we are watching the feedback 
      carefully. This may also be tied to town improvements, as mentioned above.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More information on our vision and goals for PvP will be found in the PvP 
    article early next week.</p>
    <p><b>Web Integration</b></p>
    <p>Once we finish the billing transition, currently scheduled for this 
    summer, we can begin looking at tying the Asheron’s Call website more 
    tightly to the game. Some of the features we are considering include a 
    single login to both the game and the forums, the ability to view your 
    character or allegiance statistics on the web, and ranking or ladder 
    systems.</p>

    <p>Wow! That’s a lot of information to throw at you all at once. Again, it’s

	<p>We’ve recently made or proposed a number of changes to the world of PK 
	and PKL combat, and we’d like to take this time to provide more information 
	on where we are, where we’re going, and how we feel about the state of 
	Asheron’s Call’s PvP. <br>
	<br>
	Much of the information in this document comes directly from the feedback we 
	requested on our forums. Some of the changes were not taken directly from 
	the feedback, but are part of our overall vision for PvP.<br>
	<br>
	It’s important to note that what we describe below is not set in stone. 
	While we feel strongly about many of the gameplay changes we suggest, we 
	want to hear your feedback on them. The enormous amount of negative feedback 
	regarding the March PvP changes reminded us of exactly what happens when we 
	don’t come to the PvP community before implementing these changes.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font size="3">
    <b>The Current Status</b></font><font size="2"><br>
	<br>
	The current state of Asheron’s Call PvP is, in our opinion, very good, but 
	nowhere near perfect. While there are a number of issues that need to be 
	resolved, we believe that our PvP combat is as good as, if not better than, 
	the PvP that you’ll find in any other fantasy MMP. What makes AC’s PvP so 
	good?</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li><font size="2">The animation and physics system. Projectiles are 
		real objects that can be dodged. You have the ability to maneuver in 
		combat, and your movement choices have real consequences.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">Character choices. The skill system, the vast amount 
		of varied equipment in the game, and the ability to prepare for 
		different opponents creates a number of different tactics and strategies 
		for players.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">Player skill matters. While numbers – such as number 
		of levels and number of opponents – are very important, they are not 
		necessarily the deciding factor. A skilled player can defeat a more 
		powerful unskilled player, although it may be difficult.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">Speed. One mistake in PvP combat – just one – can 
		cost you your life. Combat can happen at any time.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2">Very few safe zones on Darktide. One of the hallmarks 
		of Darktide is the knowledge that nowhere is “safe”. You can be attacked 
		anywhere, at any time. The housing system has thrown a bit of a wrench 
		in this, however.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">However there are a number of factors that 
	prevent AC’s PvP from being as great as it could. Some of these factors are:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Balance issues. While Mage / Sword 
		balance is very tight, the other melee classes and archers are currently 
		less competitive. There is still a wide gap between the Weeping Weapons 
		and all other weapons and weapon classes in PvP combat.</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Animation issues. The same system that 
		makes AC’s combat feel realistic has a number of problems. Jump-spin, 
		“godmoding” potions and other consumables, fastcasting, slidecasting... 
		these are just the top issues. This has been exacerbated by varied Dev 
		Team response and a lack of communication regarding which, if any, of 
		these actions are “acceptable” and which are “exploits”.</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Time spent preparing. Since you can be 
		attacked at any time, you must be at maximum readiness at almost all 
		times. This results in a great deal of time spent buffing and not 
		fighting.</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Lack of meaningful fights. By this we 
		mean battles that have consequences, whether that is control of a 
		location or resource, or some sort of recognizable achievement such as 
		placement on a PK ladder. Left with this void, players on Darktide have 
		created their own resources to fight over – macroing locations. </font>
		</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">All of the above issues need to be handled in 
	order to make AC’s PvP all it can be. <br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font size="3">Our Goals for the Future<br>
	</font></b><font size="2"><br>
	Our vision for AC’s PvP can be summed up in one sentence: Improve upon the 
	positive and eliminate the negative. We want to take those features 
	mentioned in the first bullet-point group above and add to them, while 
	resolving the issues in the second bullet-point group.<br>
	<br>
	When designing for PvP combat, the first group that we must always consider 
	is Darktide. Darktide is the home of the majority of our most loyal and 
	experienced PvP players, and any changes we make to PvP combat should be 
	done to improve their gameplay first and foremost. <br>
	<br>
	One goal that we strive for is <b>balanced group combat</b>. There is a 
	considerable difference between, say, PKL dueling and a Darktide raid. In 
	the former, the two opponents can set rules and guidelines, such as, “No 
	debuffing,” or “No gems”. In the latter, you have no way of knowing which 
	tactics your opponents may be ready to use against you. <br>
	<br>
	In addition, we want to have an environment in which a diverse group will 
	tend to be more powerful than a group of similar characters. For example, 
	two melees and a mage should have an edge over three melees of a similar 
	level. This edge should not be overwhelming – the three melees may be 
	skilled enough to defeat their opponents – but we want to encourage 
	diversity.<br>
	<br>
	We want to increase the number of options and tactics in PvP combat. To give 
	you an example of what we’re trying to avoid, think of a typical arcade 
	fighting game. When your opponent picks his character, you know – in general 
	– what to expect and how best to try and counter it. While player skill is 
	extremely important, you know the type of attacks that will be coming as 
	soon as you see which character your opponent selected.<br>
	<br>
	This is what we don’t want in Asheron’s Call. When you are attacked by a 
	mixed group, you should not be able to know ahead of time exactly which 
	tactics they will be using. There should be multiple equally effective 
	tactical options, and each option should have an effective counter. This 
	last paragraph speaks to a number of recent changes – banes should be able 
	to be countered with an appropriate lure, and Blood Drinker should be able 
	to be countered with Blood Loather. Negative spells should be able to be 
	countered with dispels.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font size="3"><b>Specific Proposals<br>
	</b></font><font size="2"><br>
	I’d like to take the bullet points above and speak specifically on what our 
	plans are to emphasize, or resolve, each one.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Animation and Physics<br>
	</b><br>
	Most of the issues here will be touched on under resolving the negatives. It 
	is important to stress that we want to keep the ability to move in combat.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Character Choices and Player Skill<br>
	</b><br>
	Some of our more controversial recent changes have been towards increasing 
	the number of options available to players in combat. These include the 
	ability to debuff Weeping weapons and player worn armor, the planned changes 
	to dispel gems, and the changes to Arc spell words. We seek to increase the 
	number of choices available to players in combat, and to make multiple 
	viable responses to the choices made by their opponents. <br>
	<br>
	In the case of Arcs, we want to continue to reward players who recognize the 
	spell words used by their opponents and adjust accordingly. In the case of 
	the Dispels, we wanted to create the option of dispelling level VII spells 
	through a means other than gems, and then balance gems alongside these new 
	methods. We are still considering much of the feedback that we’ve received 
	on this topic, such as timers, speed of spellcasting, and stacking the gems.<br>
	<br>
	Other planned changes include the upgrades to “second-class” weapons and 
	adjustments to the damage-over-time of the PvP weapon suites. We are also 
	looking at the possibility of creating PvP-specific imbues for loot weapons. 
	It is our goal that, for example, a melee who wants to take part in PvP 
	combat has options beyond “Weeping Sword or nothing”. To that end, we plan 
	to adjust the Weeping, Hollow, and Phantom weapons. <br>
	<br>
	We are looking at ways to improve the low-end weapons in PvP, as well as 
	improve the Hollow and Phantom weapons, without significantly impacting 
	their balance in PvM play. The goal is for Hollow and Phantom weapons to be 
	viable alternatives to Weeping weapons, and for other melee weapon groups to 
	be viable alternatives to Sword. Sword will still be strongest, but the gap 
	between it and the other weapon groups will be decreased.<br>
	<br>
	It needs to be stated plainly: It may be necessary to decrease the damage of 
	the Weeping Sword. Our current damage-over-time charts, as well as in-game 
	experiences, indicate that it may be slightly stronger than intended. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Speed<br>
	</b><br>
	The most important goal with regard to speed is that we not change the 
	current situation. While we may introduce further “countermeasure” equipment 
	such as the Aegis shield, this equipment should have drawbacks in group 
	combat. In addition, tactics that decrease a player’s damage should be able 
	to be countered through spell or dispel.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Safe Zones<br>
	</b><br>
	This brings us to the topic of housing barriers on Darktide. There is strong 
	feedback to do something about them, but the best solution may not be 
	technically feasible for some time. We are looking at removing them 
	altogether, only removing barriers from villas or mansions, or introducing 
	some form of PK timer on the ability to pass through friendly barriers. One 
	feature which we’ve seen requested – the ability to temporarily destroy a 
	hostile housing barrier – is most likely not something we can add to the 
	game anytime in the near future.<br>
	<br>
	This issue is still in discussion internally, and we value any feedback that 
	you may have.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Balance Issues<br>
	<br>
	</b>Many of the topics mentioned under <b>Character Choices and Player Skill</b> 
	apply equally to Balance. We have also tackled other balance issues 
	recently, such as the imbalance in the low-level life transfer spells. <br>
	<br>
	There are a few topics for the future that are quite specific to Balance, 
	primarily the state of missile characters in PvP. We currently have three 
	ideas in concept to improve the state of PvP missile characters.</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Aegis-like equipment. Our current design 
		is an item that could be used on any loot missile weapon to add a Magic 
		Absorbing property to it. This property would be similar to the Aegis 
		Shield and would scale based on the wielder’s Magic Defense. The 
		downside is that the missile weapon would lose any melee defense 
		adjustment that it might possess. Also, obviously, one would need to 
		choose between this weapon and one’s Weeping Bow, Crossbow, or Atlatl.</font></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">We are also looking at the possibility of 
	creating similar equipment for casting objects, in order to give mages a 
	choice similar to the choice we are giving missile users.</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Pathing options. We would like to 
		introduce a new pathing type for missile attacks. War Mages have the 
		ability to choose between Bolts and Arcs for the purposes of targeting, 
		whereas missile users have only one option. Any new option would likely 
		be either through some sort of option in the attack bar, or through a 
		new form of ammunition<br>
&nbsp;</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Speed vs. accuracy. Currently setting the 
		speed/accuracy slider to the far left allows you to fire at maximum 
		speed, but penalizes your skill by 50%. Likewise, setting the slider to 
		the far right gives you a 50% bonus to your skill, but fires at the 
		slowest rate. </font></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">We are investigating the possibility of 
	adjusting this slider to allow for fastest speed with a smaller penalty – or 
	no penalty – without changing the bonus given at slowest speed.<br>
	<br>
	These ideas are still in the design process and your feedback would be 
	useful.<br>
	<br>
	We are working to ensure that many of the topics listed in the March Letter 
	to the Players Follow-Up, such as higher wield-req weapons, do not 
	negatively impact PvP balance.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Animation Issues<br>
	</b><br>
	Right off the bat, we’d like to differentiate between animation issues that 
	we now consider to be legitimate player tactics, and animation issues that 
	we plan to resolve.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Legitimate Tactics:</b></font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Player-controlled casting times – the 
		current “fastcasting” and “delay casting”. However if a new form of 
		fastcasting emerges that would allow players to rapid-fire spells beyond 
		that which is currently seen, it would likely be considered an issue to 
		resolve.</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Slide-casting within the current movement 
		limits.</font></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">Issues to Resolve:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Jump-Spin. More on this below.</font></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">“Godmoding” potions and food.</font></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Getting around the PK jumping stamina 
		loss. (The Jump-Spin resolution may make this a non-issue.)</font></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><font size="2">Animation-breaking issues not listed 
		above. This is the catch-all for lesser-used animation-breaking actions 
		or ones not discovered or reported yet.</font></p></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="left"><font size="2">Jump-Spin deserves its own paragraph, if not 
	more. One the one hand, it seems unfair that a player should be able to so 
	badly throw off his opponent’s client simply by jumping and spinning 
	mid-jump that it breaks sticky melee and allows the player to run away. On 
	the other hand, if that is the only means of escaping from a melee, what 
	else do we expect that player to do?<br>
	<br>
	We are still working on solutions to this issue. We have previously 
	considered solutions such as restricting movement while jumping, only to 
	find that they did not resolve the issue. Currently we are designing and 
	testing several other solutions, such as adding a PK jump timer (which would 
	allow you to jump-spin, but not as frequently) or improving client 
	prediction such that a target jump-spinning does not throw off sticky. <br>
	<br>
	We are also investigating the relationship of the Run skill to sticky melee. 
	Perhaps a character with a high Run skill should have a chance to break 
	sticky from a slower opponent? These are questions that require research, 
	both into whether we can do this, and whether or not we should.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Time Spent Preparing<br>
	</b><br>
	A number of topics in the Letter to the Players Follow-Up touch on this 
	directly, from faster self buffs to multi-stat buffs and fellowship spells. 
	In general we want to decrease the amount of time you spend preparing for a 
	fight, and increase the time you spend actually fighting.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Lack of Meaningful Fights</b><br>
	<br>
	This is perhaps the most long-term issue to resolve. It is clear that the 
	PvP community, Darktide in particular, wants something to fight over. We 
	have just scratched the surface with our town revisions (putting Lifestones 
	in towns) and the PK battle dungeons in the February event. We would like to 
	add more things to fight over, with better and more tangible rewards.<br>
	<br>
	However, it is in our best interests to resolve the other issues listed 
	above before we create meaningful combat goals and rewards. So this may be 
	one of the last issues we resolve. As we work on it, we will ask you for 
	your feedback on our ideas and proposals.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Lag<br>
	</b><br>
	A frequently mentioned issue for the Darktide community is the subject of 
	lag. We receive frequent reports that lag on Darktide is worse than on any 
	other server. We are always working to resolve any server-side lag issues 
	that we find, in addition we are working on adding improved performance 
	monitoring to our servers. When this is completed our ability to diagnose 
	and resolve any server-side issues should be greatly improved.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font size="3"><b>Conclusion<br>
	</b></font><font size="2"><br>
	Asheron’s Call’s PvP players are some of our most dedicated, passionate, and 
	vocal. Many of you know the guts of this game as well as we do, and we 
	respect that. We want to improve our communication with you so that you can 
	help us make Asheron’s Call’s PvP as great as we all know it can be. <br>
	<br>
	We hope that this article has been helpful in understand the Dev Team’s 
	goals for PvP. As I wrote earlier, the proposals that I’ve listed above are 
	not set in stone. Your feedback will help us prioritize and update these 
	ideas to better match what it is that you want to see in AC. <br>
	<br>
	In the end, we want PvP in AC to be fun. If it’s fun, we’ll enjoy designing 
	for it, and we’ll all enjoy playing it. Thanks for taking the time to read 
	this, and let us know what you think!</font><font size="3"><br>&nbsp;</p>

    &lt;@Uzi&gt; before we begin thanks to jessica for doing this <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; were going to pause for a few minutes here <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Uzi&gt; thanks to s/divine one and inhuman for the idea and thanks to all the moderators for their hard work
	<br>
	<br>
	&lt;@[twisti]&gt; seems alex isnt home yet, but he said he would try to come if 
	traffic allows <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@shadowcouncil&gt; thank you <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Uzi&gt; and also thanks to everyone on darktide for doing this and shadow council for getting jessica with us. we're going to pause for a few min while we discuss questions that 
	have been asked <br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Jessica&gt; AFK to get coffee<br>
	</font><br>
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; If anyone has a question they would like to submit, please do so 
	to #dt-mods now <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@shadowcouncil&gt; to reitterate what I said earlier ONLY MRCH PATCH QUESTIONS everything else will be handled at a later meeting if this 
	one goes well <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@[twisti]&gt; Jessica, you know why we invited you here most of all, the 
	debuffable armor issue. i'm certain turbine has already seen the huge uproad 
	that announcement caused. any word on preliminary thoughts you already came 
	up with, turbine-internal ? <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@shadowcouncil&gt; First I would liek to thank Inhuman Uzi Doomgaze Som and 
	everyone else that made this meetnig possible and the ability to show 
	turbine we have adult players here <br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Jessica&gt; sure...&nbsp; let me preface the answer 
	with something we discussed today... I was trolling the boards last night 
	and reading the, uh, outrage over the debuff issue... in the middle of that, 
	shadowcouncil's PM arrived... so we started communicating and one thing led 
	to another... once we were schedule, I had a meeting with some of the team 
	at Turbine... to go over this whole issue. Pretty much the first thing said 
	was, &quot;If they knew what was coming in April, they wouldn't be so mad!&quot; At 
	which point, someone lese said, &quot;Uh... should we tell them&quot; It was a real 
	Doh! moment for us. The esson there was, we should have come to you much 
	sooner... with our complete thoughts on what we wanted to do with PvP... <br>
	Sometime early next week, Ibn will post a full explanation... however, the 
	debuffs were only one part of this. Another part, scheduled for April, were 
	level7 dispells <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; Hi folks, sorry I'm late. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; Hey, Ibn&nbsp; Anyway, the upshot is, in erfect hndsight, we 
	probably should have implemented the debuffs separately from the dispell 
	changes. er, SHOULDN'T HAVE implemented, I meant </font>
	<p>
    &lt;@Inhuman&gt; Ok, the first question comes from Solarch Arcar of the 
	Fremen Knights. Why do the devs expect us to adapt to such an extreme change. 
	This is comparable to asking humans to adapt to an asteroid hitting earth. 
	Sure we can survive but how many really will still be around? This is also 
	like bringing nukes to the 12th century. So my question i guess is, why 
	change something so drastic that threatens to leave your only PvP server 
	practically empty? <font color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; Good question. As I mentioned just a bit ago, we borked the 
	communication on the PvP changes... f we had come out sooner with the full 
	thought for your evaluation and comment... we wouldn;t be here today, wih me 
	falling on my sword and bleeding all over the floor. So, yeah, it looks 
	drastic... until you look at the whole of it.... and then it starts to mesh 
	up. But you're right, it is a big change... and we should have been out here 
	sooner, beating the bushes for comments and ideas. Thazt answer the question 
	well enough? </font>
	<p>
    <font color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Ibn&gt; I'd also like to say If I may <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; and pardon my spelling; I'm typing fast and taking no prisoners.
	<br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; Jessica is not the only one falling on her sword here. Communication 
	with you is my responsibility And I should have presented this information a 
	long time ago, when it first came up, rather than springing it on y'all like 
	this. It won't happen again. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial"><em style="font-style: normal">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; 
	Next questions is a follow up from Ainvar of Og. Even if you have wonderful plans for pvp in the long run...the short term 
	effects may prove to be too much to bear for a few months. Wouldn't it be 
	better to leave them in testing until you can complete the full plan, 
	instead of putting a few changes in, that screw some ppl over? <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@shadowcouncil&gt; Ibn to be honsest I think you have gona above and beyond 
	trying to get answers especially after all of teh personal attacks on you on 
	ac boards. You've given 110% and b eing here proves that <br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Jessica&gt; Another good wquestion...&nbsp; first, I 
	don't necessarily agree that anyone is getting screwed over by the change...
	</font><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ainvar[Og]&gt; anyone not playing a melee char might disagree ;/ <br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Jessica&gt; but I don't expect a lot of sympoathy here 
	for that view, In a perfect world, we would just run it in the dev track for 
	the two-three months necessary to complete it all... In this case, that 
	wasn't possible for a number of reasons... the main one being, we would 
	probably have had to split out the builds into two tracks... and that would 
	have just sucked royally. The devs here can testify how ugly that can get... 
	and not just ours, bt any developer. If we'd done our communication on this 
	correctly, it would have been livable and caused far less comment... 
	springing it on you exacerbates the situation. Now, when were five days 
	before the launch of the episode... it isn't even possible to revert without 
	delaying the launch for a week, maybe two. It isn't as simple as just 
	reverting to an older version (trust me on this one, we could argue it all 
	night)... So the lesson for us here is, again: get the info out to you MUCH 
	sooner...</font></em></font><p><font size="2" face="arial"><em style="font-style: normal">@[twisti]&gt; Flash of DT asks: 
	Why not leave the changes you are talking about, and allow no movement 
	fizzle? That way, mages can have *skill* again, and melees can have a chance 
	at 1v1 (considering you now have massive stamina loss when jumping so the 
	historical godmode wouldnt be possible either way) <font color="#FFFF99"> <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; Let me ask srand about that... we'd hve to break code freeze and probably delay the prop, but 
	I'll ask her for an opinion on that. </b>
	</font></em></font>
	<p><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next 
	question is from Doomgaze of KoC. In the march letter to the players, it 
	hints around new armor types, could you elaborate on this more? Perhaps if 
	you make this more clear then the whole concept of lures/brittlemail would 
	be less extreme? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; I can grab this one. We'll be revealing more information on this in a 
	post tomorrow, but I can talk about it now as well. One of the reasons that 
	we did a treasure revamp is so that we could add more interesting things at 
	the top end Such as new types of armor, as one example. You'll notice that right 
	now the treasure drops in loot are *weird*, like getting AL20 leather off 
	creatures in the Direlands. This is because we are working on the armor 
	aspect of loot along with this new armor. However the new armor is probably 
	not coming in April, it looks like May or later, so we'll be tweaking the 
	armor in loot to adjust. In the long term I would not expect this armor to 
	be considerably better than what you can get now with maxed AL and 
	tinkering. But as it is still in development, this can change. One thing 
	that is being particularly looked at is to get away from the Aluvian=lots of 
	pieces, Gharu=2 pieces, Sho is inbetween model. So you may end up with a 2 
	piece armor set that has metal prots like Celdon. As I said, this is all a 
	ways out. I am not sure that this directly impacts the lure/brittlemail 
	issue, but that's the answer. *done*</font></em><p><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next 
	question is from Addiction of Blood-Elite. Currently in pvp, if someone 
	recieves a Blood Loather 6, they will fight with the loathered weapon rather 
	then stop, and cast a dispell that consumes all their mana and a good 
	portion of time. What makes you feel dispells will be viable in PVP in april, 
	when they realistically have not been thus far? </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; I'll let Ibn answer that one, Me, I'm the ignorant one. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; The main problem with a lot of the existing dispels -- other than 
	gems, unless I'm forgetting something -- is that they can remove positive 
	spells, AND there's no 7 version. We're fixing both of these issues. There 
	will be a level 7 item dispel, and it will only remove negative spells. Not 
	ALL negative spells, but a random number. The issue of time and mana are 
	good ones -- I will make sure to relay to the team that we need to look at 
	the mana cost and time spent casting dispels. This is why it's good to bring 
	these things up earlier -- I think we would have thought of the mana and 
	casting time, but it never hurts to have a reminder.
	
	Does that answer the question?</font></em><p><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial">&lt;@Uzi&gt; yup</font></em><p><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial">@Inhuman&gt; Next question is from Uzi of Shadow Council. Will all dispells soon be removing only negative enchantments, or 
	will this apply to only item enchantment? </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"> <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; All dispels. Spells, gems, and potions. Also, while we're on the topic I should bring this up. Right now gems remove all negatives, again unless I'm misremembering, 
	while spells and potions do not.&nbsp; We will be decreasing gems such that they also only remove a random # 
	of debuffs, not all. Spells and potions will have a slightly higher chance 
	of removing more debuffs than gems.&nbsp; This is not set in stone, however, 
	And there will be both self and other versions of the dispell spells, I 
	believe (don't have the spec in front of me unfortunately) </font></em>
	<p><font size="2" style="color: #ffffff; font-family: arial">
    <em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Ibn&gt; </font></em>
	</font><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">oh wait! sorry, one last thing... you'll be able to craft dispel potions and level 6 and 7. I think to do that we're pulling the lower levels as they are rarely 
	used. OK, now I'm done</font></em><p><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next question is from Misadventure of Art of 
	War. Even then, people can still just use 3-5 gems, depending on the number 
	of spells removed, and their debuffs and vulns will be gone. Why not just 
	put a timer on them? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; I'm actually not sure that we *can* put a timer on them. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; And I;m not sure a timer provides more or less oportunity fir 
	strategy <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; But I will suggest looking into it <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; We could probably do new tech for a timer, but it wouldn;t be an 
	immediate thing. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; I don't believe that &quot;You have to wait x seconds before you can do 
	that&quot; is a particularly popular message to get in the heat of battle. 
	Sometimes a timer is the best solution, but not always. *done*</font></em><p>
	<em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next question 
	is from Solarch Arcar of The Fremen Knights. If i may ask about the life 
	magic changes. Many people not only mages(but majority) use stamina to 
	health 1 as a quick way to regain health in the heat of battle. The changes 
	being made seem to limit the ability to have great and long lasting fights. 
	What made you guys decide or encouraged you to change the current setup of 
	these spells? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; It was a hard decision. But what you said -- many people use it. 
	Across the board, at high levels. But it's not intended for that -- this is 
	supposed to be the *weakest* Stam-to-Health, the one you in general *least* 
	want to use at high levels. This wasn't done specifically for PvP. It was 
	also used by folks on the white worlds when playing PvM. When we see a level 
	1 spell being used frequently by level 126s to the exclusion of 
	higher-powered versions of the spells, we have to investigate whether that 
	spell is perhaps a bit too useful <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; In other words... </font></em>
	<font size="2" style="color: #ffffff; font-family: arial">
    <em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">ok, what 
	he said. </font></em></font>
	<p><font size="2" style="color: #ffffff; font-family: arial">
    <em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Ibn&gt; heh

    <em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">&lt;+Jessica&gt;

	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">It didn't make a lot of sense.</font></em><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><em style="font-style: normal">
	</em></font>
	<p><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial" size="2" style="color: #ffffff; font-family: arial">
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next question is from Storm of Blood. </font><font face="arial">
	Why not make lvl 7 stam2health cast as fast and in same manner as level 1 
	does now? <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@[twisti]&gt; kinda like streaks </font></em><font face="arial">
	<em style="font-style: normal"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; in essence, a level 7 'streak' <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Uzi&gt; it's necessary in pvp to cast that spell fast, otherwise your chances 
	of suriving are low </em></font><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; so the penalty is in the increased difficulty, chance to burn a plat, 
	and increased mana cost? it's something I can suggest to the team <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; We no doubt could, but doesn't it seem like higher level spells 
	should take more effort and time? Just asking. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; I can't personally say &quot;sure, good idea!&quot; or &quot;no way&quot; without 
	consulting the devs <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; The penalty is the length of the spell, 
	much of the fighting on DT is up close and personal, not alot of room to 
	move. <br>
	</font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@[twisti]&gt; the only reason to use the spell is 
	because it is fast, and the &quot;penalty&quot; is the stamina loss that usually has 
	to be followed by two casts of revit 7 <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Uzi&gt; it is similar to streaks, when someone is low on health its necessary 
	to fire a quick shot at them to finish them </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; We can certainly discuss it. Some of our other spells will be getting 
	faster in April, not sure if Jessica mentioned that before I got here. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Uzi&gt; the same thing applies when you're low, you 
	need to be able to heal fast </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font></em><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">
	<em style="font-style: normal"><br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; OK, I've cut and pasted that into the word doc of questions. 
	We'll discuss it and get you an answer. </em></font>
	<em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">Nope, 
	didn't get around to it yet (re: faster spells) <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; Ah, OK. Well, I've let the cat out of the bag, I might as well 
	explain, since this will be posted tomorrow at any rate. Life and creature 
	self buffs will all be at level 1 speed in April. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Lotusx[OG]&gt; That doesn't affect pvp at all 
	though Ibn does it? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; Well, only in that it'll be faster to buff before a fight, and that 
	we're not opposed on principle to making spells faster. Specific spells need 
	to be looked at on an individual basis. *done*</font></em><p>
	<em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next question 
	is from Xantcha of Art of War. We feel that identical spell words for arcs 
	and bolts makes combat more interesting and skillful, and that changing this 
	will lead to longer and less tactical fights. What do you feel are the 
	benefits of such a change? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; As it turns out... I asked srand the same question earlier 
	today... her answer was: Arcs were the only spells in the game that shared 
	spell words with another type of spell. The only reason this is important is 
	because different types of spells need to be dodged in different ways. So if 
	you know your spellwords, you know what the mage is about to fire at you and 
	you know which way to dodge. But this didn't work for arcs or bolts, because 
	you never knew which type of spell the mage was about to fire. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Xantcha[AoW]&gt; That's exactly the functionality 
	that we want. </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; From the mage viewpoint, this makes it easier to hit the melee. 
	From the melee viewpoint, this removes all the skill of knowing the 
	spellwords and knowing how to react to each type of spell. (bear with me. 
	You can beat me up when I'm done, ) Since PK balance favors the mage in 
	general, we felt that restoring this minor bit of skill to the melee tactics 
	was useful and not unbalancing. OK, that was the answer she gave me. Did 
	that answer your question on our raationale, at least? <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; To some extent </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; follow up? <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Xantcha[AoW]&gt; We understand the rationale, we 
	simply feel that it takes a lot of the skill out of mage combat. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; From KTV of SUN <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; just a note: many players also believe spellwards had more skill 
	to the game since players have to adapt and react depending on what is 
	casted. <br>
	<br>
	&lt;@Xantcha[AoW]&gt; The arc/bolt issue is also important in mage-only fights.
	</font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; OK, please do this: Inhuman, would you write up the objection and 
	email it to me? The more detailed, the better. And we'll take a second look 
	at it. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; absolutely, were getting quite a few 
	counterpoints on it </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; No promises, but we WILL discuss it. I'll PM you the email 
	address. If we still aren't convinced, we'll have another chat about it with 
	you.</font></em><p><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">
	&lt;@Inhuman&gt; Next question is from Darken Soul. Would you every consider 
	giving DarkTide its own set of rules? It is a different environment. For 
	example, UCMs can be killed on Darktide. Why ban them? If you aren't able to 
	kill it it isn't bothering you, because anyone can kill a UCM if they see 
	it? </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; In some things, no. Let me explain... While it is tempting to 
	allow Darktide to enforce the CoC on it's own.... the problem we have is 
	that we want to have a level playing field, and a sense that any player can 
	get justice within the COC and TOS... <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; I believe most DT'ers are more worried 
	about UCM, and not the CoC in general </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; to do thay, we have to be consistent in our enforcement... and 
	that means the CoC has to be consistently enforced across all worlds. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Doomgaze[KoC]&gt; I'd like to add something here. I 
	think the UCM banning would be a fine concept on darktide if it were 
	enforced fairly. Instead we have 3 players banned per month </font></em>
	<p><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99">
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; If a player in DT reports apossible UCM that is hogging a Tusker 
	hunting area, for example... are we to ignore him? Suince Monday, we have 
	banned at least 15 players for UCM. Should we post these numbers daily? or 
	weekly? </font></em>
	<p><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial">&lt;@Doomgaze[KoC]&gt; is the 
	hall of shame still used?</font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; The Hall of Shame is being revamped. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">@Inhuman&gt; The most asked question right now is why 
	not ignore him? UCM's are incapable of fighting back, if its really a UCM he 
	could just kill the character </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; I'm working with Katahdin and her team to get good metrics posted, 
	but the final form of those metrics hasn't yet been decided. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Doomgaze[KoC]&gt; in responce to what you just said 
	up above jess... you mentioned a senario of a ucm hogging a tusker spawn. 
	that's whY i feel ucm's reports aren't taken seriously on darktride because 
	simply put, ucms don't hog spawns here, they log off or get killed. </font>
	<font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; I understand, it was just an example <br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Ibn&gt; There are other aspects to UCM than just hogging spawns <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Doomgaze[KoC]&gt; it's allright, this was about the 
	march issues, we'll stick to that. inhuman's going to continue now. </font>

	&lt;+Jessica&gt; OK, last quesion for tonight... <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial">&lt;@Inhuman&gt; From the majority of darktide on this 
	one. A lot of darktiders feel that the devs just don't understand what group 
	fights on Darktide are like. Currently, once more than 1 melee targets a 
	mage, the mage has to run and be healed just to stay alive. If you add in 
	the decreased effectivness on stam to health, plus the luring/brittle, and 
	the decrease in war magic effectivness against skilled players because of 
	the spell words, mages will be as good as dead in group fights.</font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; but we will do this again in 4 to 6 weeks. <br>
	<br>

	fellowship can heal him, gem him, item dispell him and keep him alive vs 
	multiple melees. </font><font face="arial" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	&lt;+Jessica&gt; OK, I'm going to punt this one... to our PvP expert on the Dev 
	Team... i b n, and get a response from him tomorrow. he is a High level mage 
	with War and Life spec'd, everything else (including missile defense and 
	healing) trained. so he should have an opinion on this one. <br>

    <b><a name="revert"></a>March 18 Patch - Reverting PK Changes </b><br>
	<br>
	(<a target="_blank" href="http://forums.turbinegames.com/showthread.php?s=a2b2b40fa9534a25073d19629af8c182&amp;threadid=4780">posted</a> 
	by srand on March 15, 2004)</font><p><em style="font-style: normal">
	<font face="arial">You were right; we were wrong. We made a mistake with the 
	recent PK changes. <br>
	<br>
	We introduced several new dynamics in March that were primarily aimed at the 
	PK audience, including spell redirection to chest armor and changes to the 
	spell words of arc spells. Our intention was to add more elements of 
	optional tactics to PK combat, but the feedback that we have received since 
	the March update -- as well as our own observations in game -- have shown us 
	that these dynamics are not playing out the way we had hoped that they 
	would. The majority of feedback we have received is not happy with these 
	changes -- and since PK is one area of the game in which parity, fun, player 
	opinion, and player demand are so delicately balanced, it behooves us to 
	listen carefully. We've said that we're going to communicate with you more, 
	and listen to you better, and this is an excellent opportunity for us to put 
	our money where our mouth is. We were wrong about these changes, and we're 
	going to revert them.<br>
	<br>
	So later this week, we will be bringing down the servers to patch the 
	following PK-related functionality:<br>
	- Item enchantment spells cast on a player will not redirect to the chest 
	armor of a player. They will still redirect to a shield if one is wielded, 
	but if no shield is wielded the spell will fail (as they did prior to the 
	March update). <br>
	- The spell words for all arc spells will once again be identical to the 
	spell words for the corresponding bolt spell. <br>
	- PK/PKL players will no longer be able to use @die at the very last minute 
	in a PK/PKL battle to protect their corpse. <br>
	- Weeping weapons will once again resist all magic cast on them. <br>
	<br>
	This last PK bullet point may surprise you, since Weepings have been 
	debuffable since last December. The feedback we have received, however, 
	indicates to us that this is where we started to go wrong with our PK 
	changes -- a lot of players were beginning to see a plausible, workable 
	balance before these changes. So that is what we need to return to before we 
	can go forward. And we will be going forward -- but only after talking more 
	about what you want out of PK and discussing the options with you. <br>
	<br>
	In addition to those changes, we will also be fixing a few important bugs at 
	the same time:<br>
	- The hookable portal from the Temple of Ixir Zi will no longer be able to 
	be hooked on non-mansion housing. Existing portals hooked on non-mansions 
	will remain where they are, but once they are unhooked you will only be able 
	to re-hook them on a mansion. This portal will also look correct when 
	hooked, although you will need to rehook it to see that change. <br>
	- The spell issues on the Crown of Anointed Blood -- spells that affected 
	the wrong attribute, or had the wrong magnitude of effect -- will be fixed.
	<br>
	- The golems in the Knorr quest will once again be willing to tell players 
	their riddles. <br>
	<br>
	This patch is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, 3/18 at 9:00 AM EST. If 
	that date needs to change for any reason, we will inform you as soon as 
	possible.</font></em></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #ffffff; font-family: arial"><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial"><br>

	Turbine Site</a> (3-23-03)</font></font><p>
    <font face="arial" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	The treasure system is perhaps one of the best gameplay systems in AC. It’s 
	exciting, it’s flexible, it’s addictive, and it integrates well with other 
	aspects of the game. But after four years and a lot of plastering, patching 
	and mending, it was beginning to show its age. So recently we started on a 
	multi-month project to reinvigorate the treasure system. <br>
	<br>
	This effort has raised a lot of questions with players. It’s not intuitively 
	obvious to you what we’re doing to treasure or why we want to do it – or 
	what benefit you’re going to get out of it. And changes of this scope are 
	understandably a bit discomfiting. So we’ve written this article to tell you 
	a bit about where we want to go with treasure and how we plan to get there. 
	And, of course, we’d like your feedback on our plans. After all, this 
	treasure is meant for you. </font>
	<p>
    <font face="arial" size="3"><b>Background</b></font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Before we start talking about the changes to treasure and our goals for the 
	future, it’s going to be necessary to tell you a good bit about how treasure 
	in Asheron’s Call works. <br>
	<br>
	All treasure generators in AC – both creatures and chests – figure out what 
	treasure they will actually generate based on a treasure <i>profile</i>. 
	This profile controls treasure generation in fairly broad strokes. For 
	instance, it specifies how many items can be generated – perhaps 3 to 5, or 
	5 to 15. It also specifies what types of items can be generated and how 
	likely each type is to generate. For example, an Olthoi might drop pretty 
	much anything, but an Elemental might drop more gems, and no lockpicks at 
	all. <br>
	<br>
	It is important to understand, however, that the types of items that the 
	profile can specify are very general. For instance, the profile might 
	specify that a chest generates mostly armor and weapons with perhaps a few 
	gems thrown in, but not which kinds of weapons, armor, or gems. <br>
	<br>
	(Interesting fact: With very few exceptions, trophy items like crystal 
	shards and little green seeds are not handled by the treasure system at all, 
	but by another system entirely. This can occasionally make things rather 
	confusing. The wall spells in a Steel Chest, for instance, are actually 
	handled by the trophy system, while the bolts and arc spells are handled by 
	the treasure system. That’s because the treasure system requires that a 
	spell exist for all 7 levels, and that’s not true for wall spells.)<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps the most important property that the profile specifies is the <i>
	wealth rating</i>. There are six wealth ratings – from 1 to 6. (In the past 
	we’ve also called these ‘loot levels’, but considering how many levels we 
	have to talk about these days – player levels and creature levels and skill 
	levels and loot levels – it seems best to stick with ‘wealth ratings’ for 
	now.) The wealth rating of a profile is used in two distinct ways during 
	treasure generation. First, it is used in <i>selection</i> to select the 
	exact item that is going to be generated; and secondly it is used in <i>
	mutation</i> to determine how that item is going to be changed by the 
	treasure system. <br>
	<br>
	Let’s look at an example. The treasure profile used by the Broken Fragment 
	says that when the creature dies, it’s going to create 3 to 5 items. One of 
	those items is going to be either a healing kit (15% chance) or a mana stone 
	(15% chance) or a scarab (70% chance). The profile also says that this is 
	going to be an item with a wealth rating of 1. So when the fragment dies, it 
	rolls a random number – and let’s say that it decides that one item is going 
	to be a healing kit. Then it checks a table for the possible healing kits 
	that can occur in wealth rating 1, and determines that the healing kit can 
	be either a crude kit (75% chance) or a poor kit (25%) chance. It rolls 
	again to decide exactly which kit it will generate. <br>
	<br>
	That’s how the profile and the wealth rating control selection, but what 
	about mutation? Well, all crude healing kits are just crude healing kits, 
	but for something like a dirk the selection of the item is only the first 
	step. Once we know that we’re generating a dirk, we still need to figure out 
	all sort of things about it: how much damage it will do, its attack and 
	melee defense modifiers, its speed, its burden, what item enchantments are 
	on it, what creature endowments it casts, if it has cantrips, how much mana 
	it has, its wield requirements, its skill and heritage requirements, etc. 
	Each of these properties is assigned by mutation, and for each of these 
	properties, we are going to consult a table that is organized by wealth 
	rating. <br>
	<br>
	For example, if the profile has a wealth rating of 1, then a dirk generated 
	by this profile has a 10% chance to have a base damage of 7, a 15% chance to 
	have a base damage of 8, a 25% chance to have a base damage of 9, and so 
	forth. A dirk from a wealth rating 2 profile will have different possible 
	damages and different chances to get those damages. Mutation is one of the 
	most complicated – and one of the coolest – parts of the treasure system, 
	and there are hundreds of data tables devoted to describing this behavior. 
	These examples just give you a taste of the system. <br>
	<br>
	So now you know in general terms how the treasure profile controls the types 
	of loot that you find. And you know that the wealth rating is probably the 
	most important property of the profile because it controls the fine-grained 
	selection of treasure items as well as their mutation. With that knowledge 
	under our belt, let’s talk some about how treasure has worked historically 
	in Asheron’s Call. </font>
	<p>
    <font face="arial" size="3"><b>Where We Were</b></font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Although the basic structure of the treasure system has remained the same 
	for the past four years, the way that we use that structure has changed. The 
	best example of this is the way that we use wealth ratings. <br>
	<br>
	Wealth ratings were originally intended to control the <i>quality</i> of 
	treasure – the higher the wealth rating, the better the loot, period. There 
	was no notion of treasure being best for a particular level of player, 
	because the higher treasure was always going to be better for everyone. You 
	can see this philosophy in many places still today – a peerless healing kit 
	is always better in all ways for all characters than an excellent healing 
	kit, an excellent healing kit is always better than a good healing kit, and 
	so forth.<br>
	<br>
	This was originally true for weapons and armor as well, but that all changed 
	with the addition of wield requirements at the beginning of 2002. Wield 
	requirements are controlled by the wealth rating of the treasure profile, so 
	in a sense they correlate to the quality of the treasure. But wield 
	requirements also define brackets of treasure that corresponded (roughly) to 
	character levels rather than to simple quality. In other words, a 325-wield 
	sword is just not as useful to a newbie sword character as a no-wield sword, 
	and so you can’t really judge the quality of the two swords on the same 
	scale for all characters. <br>
	<br>
	As a measure of quality, wealth ratings have suffered from somewhat random 
	assignment to creatures over the years. Asheron’s Call has always had 
	exactly six wealth ratings, but when the game first shipped, only the first 
	five were commonly available to players. The lowest wealth ratings were 
	assigned to the low level creatures; wealth rating 4 was assigned to the 
	high level creatures; and wealth rating 5 was assigned only to very special 
	creatures like Olthoi nobles. Keep in mind, however, that the high level 
	creatures at the time were aimed at characters of perhaps level 20 or 30.
	<br>
	<br>
	Later on, as players reached higher levels and higher quality treasure 
	became more widespread, the middle wealth ratings were pushed both down into 
	lower level creatures (in an attempt to keep lower level players interested 
	in treasure) and up into higher level creatures (in an attempt to keep from 
	running out of wealth ratings). After a year or two, wealth rating 6 was 
	made more available to players through Singularity Troves, which helped the 
	high level issue temporarily, but then the addition of wield requirements 
	confused the issue – because wield requirement weapons occurred at 
	relatively high wealth ratings, but realistically lower level players needed 
	more access to those weapons. And finally, creature rebalancing and 
	redistribution came through like a whirlwind last year and shredded whatever 
	tatters of rhyme or reason may have remained in the assignment of wealth 
	ratings. <br>
	<br>
	This lead to a situation in which the wealth ratings were all bunched up at 
	the low end and spread terribly thin at the high end, with some just being 
	completely out of whack. We might have gone on this way for years, if not 
	for two factors: 1) a desire to bring new players into Dereth, and 2) the 
	growing issue of high level players. <br>
	<br>
	New players want a consistent world to play in and live in, and they 
	probably aren’t going to understand offhand why all the treasure they are 
	finding just plain sucks and that they should go hunt Olthoi Harvesters. 
	High level players, on the other hand, need high level content and high 
	level content should drop high level loot, and the fact was that once you 
	were past level 60 or so you were pretty much looking at the same treasure 
	for the rest of your character’s lifetime was just not exciting to us, or to 
	you. So somehow, we needed to straighten the system out. <br>
	<br>
	It didn’t help matters that traditionally each creature and each chest had 
	its own individually named treasure profile and so any changes to treasure 
	would need to modify over a thousand data files. That may sound good on 
	paper – each creature has its own unique profile – but in practice it didn’t 
	quite work out the way you might think. The main difference between two 
	particular golem profiles, for instance, was that one had a 67% chance to 
	drop a gem, and the other had a 70% chance to drop a gem. Unfortunately, the 
	sheer number of data files involved meant that slow, step-by-step change was 
	not feasible for the treasure system – we were really looking at a second 
	creature rebalancing. <br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="arial" size="3"><b>Our Goals</b></font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	So between the changing game environment and the maturing of the players 
	themselves, you can see how the treasure system was stuck in a hard place. 
	In order to grow, it first had to change. But how did we want to grow the 
	treasure system?<br>
	<br>
	Well, as we said in the February Rollout Article, our goals for treasure are 
	pretty simple: we want treasure to be useful and interesting. To expand on 
	that a bit, we want creatures in a particular level range to drop loot that 
	could be useful to characters in that level range. Now mind you, that 
	doesn’t mean that every single piece of treasure will be the best you’ve 
	ever seen – that might be useful, but it would very soon stop being 
	interesting. But it does mean that you should have a good chance of finding 
	something pretty darned useful. We want everyone to have good reason to 
	check the corpse of every creature they kill, because they might just find 
	something fantastic. </font>
	<p>
    <b><font face="arial" size="3">Where We Are Now</font></b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	<b>February<br>
	</b><br>
	In February, we started the laborious process of cleaning up the treasure 
	system. First, we defined a set of generic profiles for use with all 
	creatures. By limiting the number of profiles that creatures used, we made 
	the entire system easier to work with and we ensured that further changes to 
	treasure would be more feasible and easier to test. <br>
	<br>
	Now, some players were worried that standardizing the treasure profiles 
	would rob the treasure system of a lot of its richness and flexibility. This 
	is an understandable worry, but in context … Well, you have to understand 
	the scale here. We started with approximately 1200 treasure profiles – 
	roughly one for each creature and each chest. There are approximately 500 
	treasure profiles in use today, and ideally we’d like to reduce this a bit 
	further, say to 250 profiles. But even 250 different treasure profiles still 
	gives us an awful lot of flexibility and opportunities for individuality 
	among different creatures. <br>
	<br>
	We also wrote a tool to help us set the treasure profiles for every creature 
	in the game. The tool helped us quite a bit, but because of the sheer number 
	of changes involved we still only managed to get about 2/3 of the creatures 
	done for February. Most of the rest will be changed with the April update, 
	but we’ll probably be dealing with stragglers – quest creatures, mostly – 
	for another several months.<br>
	<br>
	In order to assign profiles to creatures in a rational fashion, we 
	correlated each wealth rating with a target level range. Initially, each 
	wealth rating lined up exactly with the main level ranges on the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/files/47/18/69/01/92.jpg">
	creature distribution map</a>: newbie, low, mid, high, extreme, and uber. 
	However, after reading a good bit of player feedback we realized that we 
	needed to tweak the ranges down a bit, so that you can start collecting 
	equipment for the next level range before you actually get there. These 
	tweaks will go live with the April update, and you can see the effects of 
	these tweaks in Table 4 below in the April section.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, changing the treasure profiles on creatures had a lot of side 
	effects. Some creatures saw changes in the types of items or in the number 
	of items they dropped. But the biggest side effects were tied to changes in 
	the wealth rating, and these included both changes in selection and 
	mutation. <br>
	<br>
	In terms of selections, for example, a creature that previously used a 
	wealth rating 3 profile would have previously dropped mostly good healing 
	kits. If after the realignment, however, their profile had a wealth rating 
	of 2, they would now drop primarily poor healing kits. Likewise, selection 
	changes also affected what types of weapons (tungi vs. silifi), what kinds 
	of armor (leather vs. yoroi), what kinds of gems, which healing kits and 
	lockpicks, and what levels of spell scrolls you might find on a particular 
	creature. <br>
	<br>
	We knew that all of these areas would need to be addressed eventually – and 
	some sooner than others – but we also knew that it wasn’t feasible to 
	address them all at once. Spell scrolls we addressed in March, armor types 
	will be addressed in April, and the others we hope to address in the near 
	future. <br>
	<br>
	But we felt it was more important for us to address the some of the nastier 
	mutation side effects immediately. A good example of this can be seen with 
	the wield requirements on missile weapons. Before February, you could only 
	find 250-wield missile weapons at wealth rating 4 or above. Had we left this 
	unchanged when we adjusted the profiles, you wouldn’t have had any chance to 
	find 250-wield missile weapons until around character level 60. So it was 
	important for us to adjust the wield requirement mutations, as well as other 
	mutations, to account for the wealth rating changes. Table 1 shows the 
	distribution of wield requirements for weapons after the change. <br>

	<p>
    <font face="arial" size="2">One thing you may notice here is that the top 
	three wealth ratings are all identical. In actual practice, your chances of 
	finding each level of wield requirement are different, but the range of 
	possibilities is the same. This is one area in which we have plans for the 
	future. <br>
	<br>
	(Incidentally, please keep in mind when you are looking at these tables that 
	because some creatures have not yet gotten their new treasure profiles, you 
	may occasionally run across treasure that doesn’t fit neatly into these 
	tables. Feel free to tell us about it, and we’ll get it fixed.)<br>
	<br>
	In addition to weapon wield requirements, we also adjusted the mutation of 
	weapon variance, adding more possible levels of mutation and smoothing out 
	the curves so that the best mutations were not so rare. We increased the 
	maximum damage mutations for the racial weapons, which were falling rather 
	behind in terms of damage over time, and we raised the maximum damage 
	modifier for the crossbow slightly for the same reason. Finally, we broke 
	the possible damage modifiers for all the missile weapons down into smaller 
	chunks. All of these actions supported our goal, presented above, of 
	providing more diversity in treasure. <br>
	<br>
	One mutation that we did not adjust – but which we should have – was that of 
	the offense and melee defense modifiers on weapons. Because the frequency 
	and magnitude of these mutations depends on the wealth rating of the 
	treasure profile, weapons in February were generating with fewer and lower 
	modifiers than players were expecting. In March we adjusted the magnitude of 
	the modifiers, and in April we will adjust the frequency. <br>
	<br>
	As you can see, we concentrated mostly on weapon mutation and did not adjust 
	the mutation of armor. In retrospect this was a mistake, but at the time we 
	were hoping that we could update the entire armor system in March at the 
	same time as we incorporated our new racial armors. That wasn’t ultimately 
	feasible, and so we are making interim adjustments to correct the mutation 
	issues with armor in April. <br>
	<br>
	Another major mutation change in February involved the levels of 
	enchantments that can be found on items, and the wealth ratings at which you 
	can find major and minor cantrips. After player feedback, we adjusted these 
	spell levels again in March.<br>
	<br>
	Finally, we adjusted the treasure profiles on a number of special chests. 
	Generic chests we tackled in March, but in February we changed the wealth 
	ratings of chests like the Virindi Troves, Runed Chests, VoD chests and the 
	like to bring them into line with the target character levels.<br>
	<br>
	<b>March</b><br>
	<br>
	Due to some peculiarities in our schedule, the March update took place only 
	two weeks after the February update. Because of this, the treasure changes 
	in March were generally more subtle than the February changes. <br>
	<br>
	First, we updated the profiles of the generic chests – you know, those plain 
	old treasure chests that hang out in dungeons but aren’t special or part of 
	any particular quest. This actually left us with an interesting problem for 
	the future: because the content designers were well aware that the old 
	chests had low quality treasure, they would often place only wealth rating 3 
	and 4 chests in their dungeons, regardless of the target level of the area. 
	Now, of course, this means that a lot of those chests are out of whack and 
	need to be revisited, but there are an awful lot of them and it’s going to 
	take us months to find them all. <br>
	<br>
	As part of this change, we also added a new treasure profile for the lowest 
	level of Runed chests and adjusted the existing Runed chests in places like 
	Holtburg and Yaraq – those Runed chests should no longer try to give newbies 
	325 wield requirement weapons! <br>
	<br>
	Secondly, we fixed scrolls drops. Previously, you could only find scrolls of 
	one level in each wealth rating, but with some clever hackery in the 
	treasure code we diversified scroll drops and brought them down where they 
	were more useful to players. The following table illustrates exactly what we 
	did. <br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">At the same time, we also adjusted the levels of 
	the spells that you can find on items. We had done the first pass of this in

    <font face="arial" size="2">One thing you may notice here is that the top 
	three wealth ratings are all identical. In actual practice, your chances of 
	finding each level of spell are different, but the range of possibilities is 
	the same. This is one area in which we may want to expand in the future, 
	possibly by adding level 7 spells to treasure or possibly by adding some new 
	sort of cantrip-like spell effect. <br>
	<br>
	Lastly, we made some adjustments to the mutation of offense and melee 
	defense modifiers. We had overlooked these in February – an unintentional 
	nerf – and so we wanted to get them in somewhat better shape as soon as 
	possible. We ended up adjusting them again in April, however, so see that 
	section for more details about the final state of these modifiers. <br>
	<br>
	There was one other very important – but fairly subtle – treasure change in 
	March. At the beginning of this article we talked a bit about how wealth 
	ratings used to indicate quality but are now used to indicate target 
	character level. That leaves us without a handy way to indicate quality, 
	however – and one aspect of our treasure system that we would like to 
	maintain is the notion that some creatures and some chests and just better 
	for loot. So in March we added a new ‘quality’ property to treasure profiles 
	that indicates their quality level. <br>
	<br>
	Now ‘quality’ operates within the wealth rating, but it means that treasure 
	produced by that profile is more likely to be near the maximum that that 
	wealth rating can produce. For instance, a high quality profile of wealth 
	rating 3 cannot produce major cantrips, but it is a lot more likely to 
	produce minor cantrips. Likewise, a high quality profile of wealth rating 1 
	will still produce spells of levels 1, 2, and 3, but it’s a lot more likely 
	to produce a lot of level 3 spells and rather few level 1 spells. <br>
	<br>
	This new property only appears in a few profiles in March – namely in the 
	Virindi Troves, Runed Chests, the Golden Gambling Chests, some VoD chests, 
	and a few special quest chests – but in April it will also appear on special 
	creatures<br>
	<br>
	<b>April</b><br>
	<br>
	The April update isn’t live yet, of course, and as I write this we have 
	another week of implementation followed by a week of polish. So some of the 
	information presented here may change before the April update. <br>
	<br>
	As we mentioned in the February section, one major change in April involves 
	tweaking the target character level for each wealth rating, so that you can 
	start collecting equipment for the next level range before you actually get 
	there. Table 4 illustrates this tweak. <br>

    <font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	In addition, we are extending the new ‘quality’ property to a host of 
	creatures, including randomly spawning boss monsters like the Lord of Decay 
	and Plaguefang, as well as creatures like Crystal Golem and Reedshark 
	Slasher. We also added larger treasure profiles to group-oriented creatures 
	so that they drop more pieces of loot. <br>
	<br>
	Many of the other April changes have already been discussed in the March 
	Letter to the Players Follow-Up, but we’ll list them again here in short 
	form as well:</font><ul>
		<li><font face="arial" size="2">Offense, melee defense, and mana 
		conversion modifiers will be more common at all wealth ratings. In fact, 
		at higher wealth ratings items will almost always have these modifiers.</font></li>
		<li><font face="arial" size="2">Magic casting ‘weapons’ such as wands, 
		orbs, and magic staffs will generate with melee defense modifiers just 
		like missile and melee weapons do. Magic casters will use the same 
		mutation tables as the other weapons, so the chance to get a modifier 
		and the maximum possible modifiers will be the same for all three types 
		of items.</font></li>
		<li><font face="arial" size="2">In conjunction with this, magic casters 
		can be enchanted with Defender and Lure Blade spells, and tinkered with 
		brass. </font></li>
		<li><font face="arial" size="2">Magic casters will also have the chance 
		to generate with appropriate item enchantment spells (Defender and 
		Hermetic Link) and with appropriate major and minor cantrips (including 
		skill cantrips for things like alchemy, but not for things like sword).
		</font></li>
		<li><font face="arial" size="2">All weapon types – magic, melee, and 
		missile – will have a small chance to generate with very small bonus 
		modifiers to magic defense and missile defense. To begin with, these 
		modifiers will have a maximum of 2.5% and they will not be able to be 
		enchanted or tinkered in any way. We’re excited about these new 
		modifiers because they offer some really neat new options for weapons of

		<p><font face="arial" size="2">You’ll notice that in wealth rating 5 and 
		6 there is a listing for ‘New Heritage Armor’. The artwork for these is 
		still in production, so they may not make it into the April update. But 
		the plan is for these new armors to be very similar to Amuli, Koujia, 
		and Celdon – except that they will look much cooler. <br>
		<br>
		We are also addressing many of the concerns about the mutation of 
		treasure armor in April. The main change is that all treasure armor will 
		mutate – which means no more AL 20 armor in the Valley of Death. We are 
		also adjusting the magnitude of armor level mutations so that the 
		distribution will better match the distribution that you were used to 
		before February. In addition, some of the lower types of armor – like 
		leather – may end up with higher maximum armor levels than they could 
		achieve before. <br>
		<br>
		Finally, we will also be updating Covenant Armor. Previously, Covenant 
		armor used a mathematical formula to determine its wield requirement 
		based on its armor level. In other words, if you had a piece of Covenant 
		armor with AL 213 and a melee defense requirement, then that melee 
		defense requirement was going to be about 208. This wield requirement 
		might also be increased more if the piece mutated its protections. <br>
		<br>
		In April, however, the wield requirements on Covenant armor will work 
		much more like the wield requirements on weapons: if the piece has an 
		armor level between 300 and 350 and a melee defense requirement, then 
		that requirement is going to be 300 regardless of the exact armor level 
		or the protections. The following two tables describe this behavior. <br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Two important things to note: Covenant armor 
	will be able to occur with a magic defense wield requirement as well as 
	melee and missile defense requirements. In addition, most pieces of Covenant 
	armor will be available with higher wield requirements and higher armor 
	levels than previously. We wanted the best Covenant armor to be able to 
	compete with fully tinkered non-Covenant armor in terms of armor level. The 
	one exception is Covenant shields, which for balance reasons we have limited 
	to lower armor levels. </font>
		<p>
    <b><font face="arial" size="3">The Future</font></b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Going forward, we still have a number of changes that need to be made in 
	order to meet our goals for the treasure system. We also have a lot of cool 
	new treasure features that we’d like to add. <br>
	<br>
	We need to revisit a lot of the selection tables for supplies like healing 
	kits, lockpicks, mana stones, scarabs, potions, food, etc. One option that 
	we are considering is removing most of these items from creature treasure 
	and instead making them more available at vendors. Another option is to 
	change these items so that items from higher wealth ratings are not always 
	better than items from lower wealth ratings in all situations. <br>
	<br>
	For instance, healing kits have two important properties – a skill bonus 
	that increases your effective healing skill, and a healing boost that 
	increases the maximum amount that you can heal. Right now, healing kits from 
	higher treasure have both a higher skill bonus and a higher healing boost 
	than kits from lower treasure – they are just better in every way. But 
	perhaps we should change that so that kits from lower treasure tend to have 
	a higher skill bonus, while kits from higher treasure have a higher healing 
	boost. In this way, lower level kits would presumably be more useful for 
	lower level characters. <br>
	<br>
	Another area that we’d like to revisit is arcane lore, and in particular how 
	arcane lore requirements are affected by rank and skill requirements. This 
	may fit in well with adding level 7 spells to treasure items, if and when we 
	do that. <br>
	<br>
	In terms of cool new features, we’re considering adding higher level wield 
	requirements to missile and melee weapons, and adding wield requirements to 
	magic casters at high levels. For melee weapons, it would be sufficient to 
	increase the damage of these weapons, but for missile weapons and magic 
	casters we have a slightly different idea in mind. In short, missile weapons 
	would get a flat damage bonus (similar to the bonus from Blood Drinker) 
	*only* when the damage type of the arrow in use matched the damage type of 
	the bonus. Similarly, magic casters might have a damage bonus multiplier 
	that worked the same way – applying the modifier only when the damage of the 
	war spell matched the damage type of the bonus. <br>
	<br>
	The following table presents our current thoughts on the skill levels we 
	would like to see in the future for wield requirement. Note that magic 
	casters come in at a higher level, because below that level the spell levels 
	provide an effective scale of damage. <br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">This is only one option we are looking at for 
	higher level wield requirements on weapons, but we are pretty certain that 
	we want to add them in some fashion. Some players have expressed concerns 
	already that higher level wield requirements will further encourage a 
	‘min-max’ mentality, and that more well-rounded characters will be left 
	behind. For this reason, we want to design these higher weapons so that they 
	provide only a negligible benefit in terms of damage but function more as a 
	status symbol for high level characters. <br>
	<br>
	We would also like to revise and expand our armor system in the future, both

	As we mentioned in the recent March Letter to the Players Follow-Up, one our 
	near-term projects is to increase the usefulness and versatility of the 
	dispel spells. After reviewing your feedback from the Letter and discussing 
	the options in a number of team meetings, we’ve come to a consensus on the 
	following plan. Now we’d like to present it to you and get some final 
	feedback before we put this plan into action.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="arial" size="3">Player-Cast Dispels</font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Dispels Remove Only Negative Spells:</font></b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Dispels that are cast by players currently remove both negative and positive 
	enchantments. Because of this, an NPK player could not use a dispel on a 
	fellow NPK player – because they would dispel the other player’s buffs. 
	Player-Killers could however use dispels to remove both positive and 
	negative enchantments from their target – an effect that was not entirely 
	desirable for either friend or enemy. To address these issues, we are 
	planning to change all dispel spells cast by players to remove negative 
	spells only. This will affect both existing and newly-learned spells: all 
	dispel spells currently in a player's spell book will change to spells that 
	remove negative enchantments only, and all newly-learned dispels will also 
	remove negative enchantments only.</font><p>
    <font face="arial" size="2"><b>Level 7 Dispels:</b><br>
	<br>
	Dispels that are cast by players are currently only available up to and 
	including level 6. We will be expanding to include level 7 dispels for each 
	of the three schools that currently have them (Creature, Item, and Life). 
	The level 7 dispel spells will follow the same “double-scarab” pattern found 
	in other dispels, using Platinum and Diamond scarabs.</font><p>
    <font face="arial" size="2"><b>Mana Usage:</b><br>
	<br>
	Dispel spells currently require a substantial amount of mana to cast, 
	starting at 50 mana for the level I versions. We feel that the mana cost is 
	slightly too high for these spells, so we are considering adjusting them 
	downwards. The following table shows current mana costs for dispels, and our 
	possible new mana costs.<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2"><b>Learning the Spells:</b><br>
	<br>
	Currently, the scrolls for dispel spells are found in Steel Chests 
	exclusively, and all levels of dispel spells are found in Steel Chests. Our 
	plans include the ability to find all levels of dispel scrolls in creature 
	treasure and in chests. Creatures of all level ranges that can currently 
	drop spell scrolls will have the chance to drop dispel scrolls. And Level 7 
	dispels will occur in Steel Chests. Scriveners will not sell these spells.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="arial" size="3">Gems, Potions, and Magic Casters with 
	Dispel Ability<br>
	</font></b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	Dispel gems, dispel potions, and magic casters with an inherent dispel spell 
	(such as the Awakener and the Attenuated Awakener) are very similar, but in 
	the past they have rather different behavior in terms of what kinds of 
	spells they dispel and how many spells they dispel. Going forward, however, 
	we propose to give them all the same behavior in these areas. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Dispels Remove Only Negative Spells:</b><br>
	<br>
	Dispel potions currently remove both positive and negative enchantments 
	which we feel reduces the usefulness of these craft items. Our plans include 
	changing dispel potions to remove negative enchantments only. Dispel potions 
	will use the same type of dispel spells used for both dispel gems and magic 
	casters with dispel ability. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Level 7 Dispels:</b><br>
	<br>
	It is only possible to create dispel potions up to level 5 currently. Our 
	plans include the ability to craft level 6 and 7 dispel potions using 
	techniques similar to the current dispel potion crafting processes. In 
	addition, the lower gems –which current dispel level 4 and 5 spells – will 
	dispel level 5 and 6 spells respectively. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Number of Spells Removed:</b><br>
	<br>
	Dispel gems and the Awakener and the Attenuated Awakener currently have no 
	maximum limit on the number of negative spells they will remove when used. 
	This behavior will not change, but dispel potions will gain the same 
	behavior to bring them into line. In other words, dispel potions will also 
	dispel every negative spell on the player. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Stacking:<br>
	</b><br>
	In order to increase the convenience of dispel gems and dispel potions, 
	these items will now stack to 25. </font>
	<p align="left">
    <b><font face="arial" size="3">Other Important Issues</font></b><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	<b>Layered Spells:</b><br>
	<br>
	We had originally discussed removing the ability for dispel gems to remove 
	all negative spells. One issue with this however is the fact that creatures 
	will frequently cast the same negative spell on a player multiple times, 
	creating multiple “layers” of the same spell. Many players voiced their 
	concern that removing the ability of dispel gems to remove all negative 
	spells would result in a situation where they could only remove several 
	layers of a spell, and not all layers. This issue could also impact magic 
	casters with dispel abilities. In response to these concerns, we have 
	decided to hold off on removing the ability for gems to dispel all negative 
	spells while we investigate solutions that would prevent the layering effect 
	from occurring. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Creature-Cast Dispels:</b><br>
	<br>
	Due to the planned changes in dispels, we will also be removing the ability 
	for most creatures to cast dispel spells on players. Traps, however, will 
	keep this ability (as will very special ‘creatures’ such as Asheron 
	himself). <br>
	<b><br>
	</b>PK Timer:<br>
	<br>
	Many Player-Killers have expressed concern over the current use of dispel 
	gems and dispel items in PK combat. With the coming dispel updates and 
	additional dispelling options, Player-Killers foresee the current, 
	relatively moderate issue with dispels and dispel items quickly degrading 
	into a perpetual dispel-debuff-dispel stalemate. We are investigating the 
	issues involved in tying the use of dispel spells, dispel gems, and other 
	dispel items to the 20-second PK combat timer. This is one area in which we 
	would particularly like to hear more of your opinions. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Feedback</b><br>
	<br>
	These changes impact PvM combat and PvP combat in very different ways. 
	Because of this, we've created two separate feedback threads: one for PvM 
	and one for PvP.</font><font style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: arial"><font size="2" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #ffffff; font-family: arial"><em style="font-style: normal"><font face="arial"><br>

    Hunting in Asheron’s Call requires certain safety precautions: a skill that 
    allows you to kill your foes, the defensive skills to avoid harm from your 
    foes and powerful magic to lessen the damage that your foes can do. As we 
    have added more difficult challenges and creatures to the game we have 
    introduced higher-level spells and increased spell durations on critical 
    buffs. These changes, while positive, did nothing to lessen the amount of 
    time that was taken for hunt preparation. In fact, the inclusion of 
    harder-hitting monsters and more powerful spells increased the amount of 
    spells that some felt was necessary for hunting; as a result, Item spells 
    were added to buffing queues and the wind up time on level seven spells 
    lengthened the buffing process. Based on our analysis as well as player 
    feedback, we’ve realized that something indeed needs to change. Thus, we 
    have come up with the following document to present the future of buffing to 
    all Asheron’s Call players.<br>

      Self Buffs</b></div>
    </font><font style="COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">
    <p>The first major change comes in April’s update. Self-cast Creature and 
    Life Magic spells have had casting timers shortened, they will now cast as 
    if they were a level one spells at all levels. There are a couple of reasons 
    for this change:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase the value of having the magic school trained. </li>
      <li>Remove the tedium from buffing your character to start hunting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This change is currently in testing for release in the April update.</p>
    <p>While this change will decrease the overall time that it takes to prepare 
    for hunting it does not address the need to go through the keystroke motions 
    necessary to cast spells. Changes to reduce that tedium will continue to be 
    worked towards for the future.<br>

    <div class="headlineMedium">
      Fellowship Spells</div>
    </font><font style="COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">
    <p>The second big change is the inclusion of Fellowship spells. These will 
    be released over time and will be a boon to players that enjoy hunting and 
    buffing in groups. The current plan is to introduce Fellowship Spells for 
    all Creature and Life spells, with the possibility of some Item spells as 
    well.</p>
    <p>The difficulty for fellowship spells is 25 higher than the corresponding 
    non-fellowship spell. The base mana cost for each fellowship spell is the 
    same as that of the corresponding non-fellowship spell, but each additional 
    target costs an extra 10 mana. So if you cast a level 7 spell on a 
    fellowship of 8, it will cost 140 mana (before conversion).</p>
    <p>So how will I be able to learn these new spells? Good question.</p>
    <p>Fellowship spells are slated to be released over time and will eventually 
    include all Life and Creature Buff spells and possibly Item Magic buff 
    spells, including portal spells. At the moment, the thought is to release 
    these slowly through quests rather than include then as part of the random 
    loot generator, as they are more specialized spells. They will all have 
    unique names and will likely only be made available for level four through 
    seven spells. </p>
    <p>There is a possibility that we’ll also be introducing Fellowship healing 
    spells at some point, but we need to take the proper time to balance such 
    spells as they could have serious negative impact in Player vs. Player play.
    </p>
    <p>Portal spells are also under consideration, though it is too early to 
    tell what existing portal sending spells will be given a fellowship variant.<br>

      Multi-Stat Spells</div>
    </font><font style="COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: arial" size="2">
    <p>Multi-Stat spells are spells that affect multiple character statistics at 
    once.</p>
    <p>With these spells it would be possible to increase up to three statistics 
    at any one time. Thus you could cast a spell that would affect your 
    Endurance, Strength and Quickness with just one spell.</p>
    <p>Our current design includes these spells for level one through seven 
    spells and is currently restricted to Creature and Life Magic schools. There 
    are considerations being made for Item Magic, see the section on Item Magic 
    later in this document.</p>

    <p>The second hurdle with Multi-stat spells is that we need to group the 
    spells together effectively. Do we create spells that affect Life Magic and 
    Sword together in one spell? Or do we keep Sword grouped with Melee Defense? 
    Conceptually we have several spells grouped already.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of our current design: (these currently only 
    include Creature Enchantment spells)</p>

    <p>Because these are only being conceptualized at the moment there is still 
    a lot of room for change to occur.</p>
    <p>The second major question with Multi-Stat spells is the distribution and 
    acquisition of the new spells. We want to see these spells integrated into 
    world safely and quickly, we also know that players will want to craft their 
    own spells for use.&nbsp; As a result we’re currently considering two options.</p>
    <p>The first options would place spell scrolls into the loot system. These 
    would be found as part of normal scroll distribution across all levels of 
    loot. The second option is to place them in sturdy chests that currently 
    have level seven spells. This option would give some value back to the 
    Sturdy Iron Keys.</p>
    <p>You’ll simply need to use the scroll after finding it and, if your magic 
    skill is high enough, the spell will be added to your spellbook and you will 
    be able to cast it yourself. Regardless of the distribution process, 
    three-spell variants will be rarer than the two-spell variants. </p>
    <p>Multi-Stat spells will be most likely be added sometime this year. They 
    will probably be created only for self spells first, with the possibility of 
    other spells in the distant future.<br>

    <p>Baning. With the possibility of nine separate armor pieces to buff, ten 
    if you have a shield, it is possible that you are casting eighty Item 
    protection spells per hunting session. That’s a long time to be standing 
    around and pressing a sequence of buttons over and over. So what are we 
    planning on doing about Item Enchantment?</p>
    <p>First and foremost, we want to curb the length of time that it takes 
    people buff. To state that more clearly, we want to reduce the amount of 
    time it takes for self-buffing players to complete their buff cycle. The 
    emphasis is on improving buffing for those players with access to these 
    spell schools. It is important to remember that this is the primary goal of 
    buff improvements when evaluating this section, as the following 
    improvements are all only considerations at this point.</p>
    <p>Our first consideration is to make all Item Enchantment spells fast cast, 
    as we are doing for Creature and Life Magic spells. This would go a long way 
    to curb the length of time that people buff. </p>
    <p>The second option is to extend multi-stat spells to Item Enchantment. 
    This would allow players to cover several banes at once and therefore cut 
    down on the number of spells that are being cast as part of their buffing 
    cycle. While this option alone would not completely alleviate the length of 
    time that it takes to buff oneself for hunting, it would be another avenue 
    to alleviate the tedium.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Lastly, we are considering the option to allow Item Enchantment to 
    spread to all valid targets on a player. This would mean you could target 
    yourself, cast Impenetrability and it would spread to all of the possible 
    targets on your character. This would cut the spell count down to eight, 
    sixteen with a shield, and really speed the process along.</p>
    <p>There is a possibility that we’ll combine some options together, when we 
    solidify design plans we’ll let you know what options were chosen.<br>

      Conclusion</div>

    <font style="COLOR: #ffffff; FONT-FAMILY: arial; " size="2">
    <p>It’s going to be an interesting year. There are several changes that are 
    coming to buffing and spell casting in general. The overall goal of the 
    buffing changes is to allow players to get into the heat of battle more 
    quickly, and with the changes that we currently have on our plate we think 
    that we can achieve that goal.</p>
    <p>Your feedback on these topics will be very valuable as we continue 
    working on these designs and prioritize which ones will go into the game 
    first. Which of these ideas do you like or dislike? Which do you like or 
    dislike <i>most</i>?</p>
