	<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">“There’s trouble,” Antius said, 
	leading Hendac into the room.<br>
	<br>
	“When is there not?” Elysa responded, motioning to a set of chairs and 
	flashing him a meager smile. She had been looking out her window, running 
	her fingers over the scar in the center of her chest. Even though it had 
	healed it burned still. Often she thought that the burning was all in her 
	mind, knowing that out there somewhere, someone had wanted her dead. She put 
	the thought from her mind and turned toward the table and chairs where 
	Antius and Hendac now waited.<br>
	<br>
	“What is it?” she asked, sitting in a chair beside Antius.<br>
	<br>
	Hendac pushed a small leather scrollcase toward the High Queen. She reached 
	across and took the case up. It was too large to be made by Isparians and 
	the leather was tanned to be softer. It bore a resemblance to the hunting 
	bags carried by the Tonk of Marae Lassel. Elysa recalled seeing the bags 
	only recently; hunters from Marae Lassel had asked to hunt on Dereth and 
	issue challenges to the Ispar tribe. They had set up a few camps across 
	Osteth, and even near Ayan Baqur.<br>
	<br>
	She undid the clasp, a stone buckle. The buckle was heavy and shaped 
	squarely, Lugian-made. Lord Kresovus had expressed some anger over the 
	continued slaughter of his warriors by some Isparians, but there had been 
	fewer skirmishes in recent weeks and the matter seemed to be at rest. The 
	only other group that could have made this was the renegade force that had 
	splintered away from the Virindi.<br>
	<br>
	“Renegades,” she read the first few lines. “They mean to join with these new 
	creatures?”<br>
	<br>
	“Apparently,” Antius said. Beside him Hendac bobbed his head, the furrow of 
	his brow displaying his displeasure. “There’s more.”<br>
	<br>
	Elysa finished reading and Hendac produced a folded scrap of parchment from 
	within the folds of his leathers. He rose and walked to Elysa’s other side 
	and placed the parchment on the table. He pointed two fingers to his eyes 
	and then tapped the parchment. Elysa knew what he meant.<br>
	<br>
	“How did they build this?” Elysa asked as she stared at the drawing. It was 
	done in Hendac’s hand and showed a fortress of some kind. It was set against 
	the side of a plateau with two mammoth stone sentinels towering on the 
	forward edges of the flat land above.<br>
	<br>
	“It’s unclear, but Hendac has assured me that the structures appear to be 
	identical to those at Candeth Keep. We visited the keep and found that one 
	of the guards had gone missing recently. A Lugian, Okret.” Antius paused. 
	“He’d been stationed there since the work was first started on the outpost. 
	His departure, and the discovery of this fortress – well, they seem to be 
	more than coincidence.”<br>
	<br>
	Elysa nodded.<br>
	<br>
	“The Blackmire Swamp is being overrun by the Burun, Elysa. This new race has 
	already driven most of the Mosswarts from there. I’ve no love for the 
	Mosswarts, but they’re being slaughtered.” He paused. “That missive is from 
	the fort in the Direlands. Muldaveus and Niarltah want to join forces with 
	this new race, and if they do who knows which race they’ll displace next.”<br>
	<br>
	“I know, Antius. We need to stop them. I’ll speak with Kresovus.” She paused 
	and folded the parchment before handing it back to Hendac. “Perhaps he’ll be 
	willing to send agents of his own into the Renegade camp.” It sickened her 
	to say those words. She had prided herself on being honest and forthright 
	throughout her life, now she was resorting to deceit. “We’ll do what we can 
	to keep the Renegades and Burun apart.”<br>
	<br>
	Elysa stood and walked back to her window, rubbing the wound on her chest.</font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">The sound of breaking bones and tearing 
	flesh filled the small cavern. Okret had volunteered for this assignment 
	because he knew that Muldaveus and Niarltah would look favorably on him 
	should he perform the task well. As he stood in the entrance of this fetid 
	cave, he began to think this had been an error in judgment. Cautiously he 
	hoisted the great stone chest onto his shoulder and proceeded deeper into 
	the grotto. Wails filled his ears and grew louder, serving as a beacon and 
	guiding him deeper into the living cave. <br>
	<br>
	The ground was moist, spongy and covered in a thin film of yellow slime. The 
	place reeked of the swamp and something even fouler than decay. He paused to 
	look at the peculiar sight of a phyntos wasp firmly stuck onto a small pike. 
	He placed the stone chest on the ground and knelt to study the craft of the 
	pike. <br>
	<br>
	A set of yellow eyes blinked in the darkness of a nearby tunnel. The burun 
	hunkered low, revealing two other sets of eyes. They moved just into the 
	light of the wide cavern where Okret knelt and gnashed their rows of jagged 
	teeth. In unison, the three let out a growl and screech like nothing Okret 
	had ever heard.<br>
	<br>
	Many of this month’s changes have already been described in detail in the 
	Letter to the Players. There are a few other topics that we’d like to 
	discuss in detail.</font></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>Defender and Lure Blade<br>
	</b><br>
	We recently discovered a bug with the spells Defender I, III and V; and Lure 
	Blade I, III and V. The amount of the bonus or penalty that these spells 
	granted did not match the amount listed in the spells’ descriptions. <br>
	<br>
	To resolve this issue, we made the numbers match and we always used the 
	greater value. For example, if the description listed a greater change than 
	the spell actually granted, the spell was changed. If the spell caused a 
	change greater than the listed description, the description was changed.<br>
	<br>
	The table below shows the spells with their new values.</font></font></p>

	<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Imbue Underlays</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is now a visible difference between 
	imbued and unimbued weapons. Imbued weapons have a colored background, with 
	the color representing the specific type of imbue.<br>
	<br>
	The following chart shows the different colors for imbues:</font></p>
	<p><img border="0" src="Mired/131.jpg" width="398" height="600"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial"><br>
	<font size="2"><b>Unopened Corpse Keys<br>
	</b><br>
	From the Configure Keyboard option, you can now bind keys to two new 
	commands: Closest Unopened Corpse and Next Unopened Corpse. These keys 
	target unopened corpses in a manner similar to that used by the Next Monster 
	and Closest Monster commands.<br>
	<br>
	These new commands will not only select the unopened corpse, they will also 
	attempt to open the corpse, just as if you’d double-clicked it. This will 
	make your character walk to the corpse if you are not within usable distance 
	of it.<br>
	<br>
	Please note that these new keyboard commands do not currently track whether 
	or not you have permission to open the corpse or whether or not the corpse 
	is currently being looted by another player. For example, if you hit the key 
	bound to Next Unopened Corpse and you may not loot the corpse for some 
	reason, the game will behave just as if you had double-clicked on the 
	corpse. You will walk over to the corpse, if necessary, and then receive an 
	error message in the upper left-hand corner of your screen.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Configurable Timestamping</b><br>
	<br>
	There is a new option in the Character Options panel: Display Timestamps. 
	The option is followed by some symbols and text in green.<br>
	<br>
	When this option is checked, the text in green will be displayed before each 
	new entry in your chat box. The symbols represent various replacement 
	filters so you can customize the timestamp display.<br>
	<br>
	For more information on configuring this option, as well as examples, visit 
	the Timestamp Options page in Asheron’s Handbook.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Stackable Gems</b><br>
	<br>
	The following types of Portal Gems are now stackable to a maximum of 25: 
	Town Portal Gems, Archmage Portal Gems, and Tusker Island Portal Gems.<br>
	<br>
	Some players use these gems – particularly the Archmage Portal Gems – as 
	death items, so it’s important to note how stackable items work with the 
	death system. When you die, a stack is considered to be one item for the 
	purposes of death items. However if that stack is selected, only one item 
	off the stack will drop.<br>
	<br>
	For example, let’s say you can currently cover all of your items with five 
	Portal Gems. After the event, if you do not stack these gems there will be 
	no change. However, if you combine the five gems into a single stack, you 
	would drop one gem and four other items on death.</font></font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome to the May Letter to the Players! <br>
	<br>
	Last month in Dereth, the Burun continued to pour through the newly-opened 
	portal in the Blackmire Swamp. They’ve begun to set up camps, driving out 
	several of the other inhabitants. In addition, another Falatacot temple was 
	discovered in the A’mun Desert beneath the stone structure previously 
	inhabited by Archmage Fadsahil al-Tashbi. <br>
	<br>
	Despite the new threat, Spring in Dereth continues. Young creatures romp 
	across the landscape. The Lugians of Linvak Tukal have made improvements to 
	their home to make it more welcome for travelers. New forms of armor have 
	been found along with weapons bearing new enhancements. <br>
	<br>
	Yet the question remains: With Burun now entering Dereth from two locations, 
	what can be done about them?<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	<i>(These are items that we plan to implement in the May event. Many of 
	these items were mentioned in the April Letter to the Players In Development 
	section and the <b>In Development</b> Follow-Up.)</i><br>
	<br>
	<b>Allegiance Improvements<br>
	</b><br>
	Allegiances will be getting a number of new tools in May. Most of these are 
	intended to make it easier to manage an allegiance. </font>
	<ul>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@allegiance boot –account [character]</b>: 
		This command will boot all characters on the same account from an 
		allegiance. The player running this command will be informed of the 
		number of characters booted, but not their names.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@allegiance ban add/remove 
		[character]</b>: This command will add or remove an allegiance account 
		ban. When a monarch or allegiance officer places an allegiance account 
		ban on a character, that character and any other characters on the same 
		account will not be permitted to swear into the allegiance. There is a 
		maximum of 32 allegiance account bans at one time.<br>
		<br>
		This command will also boot any character on this account.<br>
		<br>
		Please note that it is still technically possible for a character on a 
		banned account to enter an allegiance. This can occur if the monarch of 
		a banned character swears into the allegiance. For example, let’s say 
		that I am banned from Zyrca’s allegiance. My monarch, Srand, swears to 
		Zyrca. In this situation I would be in Zyrca’s allegiance until the next 
		time I log in to the game. The next time I log in, I will be 
		automatically booted.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@allegiance ban list</b>: This 
		command will list all characters that have been banned from the 
		allegiance.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@allegiance chat kick [character] 
		(,[reason])</b>: This command will temporarily remove a character from 
		the allegiance chat room. If a reason is given, it will be displayed, 
		otherwise the default reason is “No reason given.”<br>
		<br>
		For example: if Zyrca were my monarch, and she typed <i>@allegiance kick 
		Ibn, Talks too much</i>, I would be temporarily removed from the 
		allegiance chat channel and I would receive the following message:<br>
		<br>
		<i>You have been booted from your allegiance chat room. Use &quot;@allegiance 
		chat on&quot; to rejoin. (Zyrca: Talks too much)</i><br>
		<br>
		We are currently working on general improvements to chat which, when 
		implemented, will allow for better controls on the allegiance chat 
		system. This is intended to provide some of that functionality until the 
		larger changes go in.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@allegiance officer add/remove 
		[character]</b>: This command will add or remove an allegiance officer. 
		Allegiance officers have the power to run any existing monarch command, 
		except for the ability to add or remove other officers. This ability was 
		removed based on player feedback.<br>
		<br>
		Officers will be able to use all of the broadcast and message of the day 
		commands, <i>@allegiance info</i>, and all of the boot, ban, and kick 
		commands. They will not have the ability to change allegiance mansion or 
		villa guest or storage lists. Allegiance officers also will not be able 
		to boot the monarch.<br>
		<br>
		Please note that it is possible for an officer to boot a character that 
		is above them in the allegiance tree, either through <i>@allegiance 
		boot, @allegiance boot –account</i>, or <i>@allegiance ban</i>. If this 
		occurs, the officer will lose his or her powers as they were granted for 
		the old allegiance, not the new one.<br>
		<br>
		Allegiances will be able to have two allegiance officers. The allegiance 
		officer position replaces the existing allegiance speaker position. For 
		the sake of security, existing allegiance speakers will be removed 
		during the May event.<br>
		<br>
		Monarchs can also use <i>@allegiance officer clear</i> to remove both 
		allegiance officers at once.<br>
		<br>
		Any member of an allegiance can use <i>@allegiance officer list</i> (or 
		just <i>@allegiance officer</i> with no other arguments) to see the list 
		of their allegiance’s officers.<br>
		<br>
		We’re working on expanded functionality and multiple levels of 
		allegiance officers; see the <b>In Development</b> section for more 
		details.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>@house storage add_allegiance</b>: 
		This gives your entire allegiance access to your house storage. To 
		remove this access, use <i>@house storage remove_allegiance</i>. Please 
		note that this is for your own personal house storage. To give full 
		allegiance access to the storage in an allegiance mansion or villa, this 
		command must be run by the allegiance monarch.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Allegiance Bindstones</b><br>
		<br>
		As we mentioned was possible, we were not able to complete the code for 
		Bindstone functionality in May. After the May event, you will find 
		Bindstones in towns, but using them will have no effect. This will give 
		Allegiances the opportunity to plan where they wish to bind when the 
		Bindstones become active, currently planned for the June event.<br>
		<br>
		We will be providing more information on how Allegiance Bindstones will 
		work in the June Letter to the Players, but we’d like to take this time 
		to address two questions that were brought up after the In Development 
		Follow-Up article was posted.<br>
		<br>
		When determining which towns should receive Bindstones, we made the 
		decision to give a Bindstone to any town that currently has a Meeting 
		Hall. These towns are: Al-Arqas, Al-Jalima, Arwic, Baishi, Cragstone, 
		Eastham, Glenden Wood, Hebian-to, Holtburg, Khayyaban, Lin, Lytlethorpe, 
		Mayoi, Nanto, Qalaba’r, Rithwic, Sawato, Shoushi, Tou-Tou, Tufa, Uziz, 
		Yanshi, Yaraq, and Zaikhal.<br>
		<br>
		After reading your feedback on our forums regarding this idea, we have 
		decided not to place any restrictions on which monarchs may use the 
		Bindstone. They can be used by an allegiance whether or not the monarch 
		owns a mansion or villa.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Treasure Changes, Part IV</b><br>
		<br>
		In the April Letter to the Players, we stated that the Treasure work for 
		May would be back-end and not visible to players. This is no longer true 
		– we’ve found ourselves with the opportunity to improve treasure 
		selection in several places.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Art Items and Casters<br>
		</b><br>
		We’re moving “art items” (mugs, plates, and the like) and casters into 
		several loot tables where they previously did not exist. This will 
		result in both being found in places where you could not find them 
		before – for example, in May you’ll be able to find casters in the 
		casino golden chests. This will make casting items – as well as certain 
		types of salvage – easier to find. You will also be able to find art 
		items with spells on them, such as a bowl with Alchemy Mastery for 
		example.<br>
		<br>
		<b>“Mundane” Items<br>
		</b><br>
		This category covers all the “other” things found in loot – spell 
		components, mana stones, healing kits, lockpicks, and potions. These 
		categories of items have not changed much since the early days of 
		Asheron’s Call, and the treasure revisions have only highlighted this.
		<br>
		<br>
		To improve the situation, we will be adding new types of mana stones and 
		potions, and low-level healing kits are being improved and renamed. Then 
		we’ll be redistributing all mundane items across different levels of 
		treasure. <br>
		<br>
		Healing kits will also now provide more information regarding their 
		effects. Healing kits can provide a bonus to your skill check, or a 
		bonus to the amount you heal, or both. Now you’ll be able to see which 
		is which just by ID’ing the kit.<br>
		<br>
		Just as an example, here’s how the changes would affect the types of 
		items you could find in wealth rating 5 treasure, intended for level 80+ 
		characters.</font></p>

		<p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">In general, we’ve made existing items show up 
	sooner and created new items to fill the gaps at the high end. You’ll note 
	that there are no new lockpicks yet – don’t worry, we’re working on some 
	ideas for interesting high-end lockpicks.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Chests and Fishing Holes</b><br>
	<br>
	One effect of the treasure changes is that a number of newbie and low-level 
	chests had their treasure bumped up considerably. This resulted in many 
	newbie chests generating treasure that no newbie could possibly use. We’ve 
	adjusted the loot in many of these chests, and will continue tweaking 
	additional chests in the coming months.<br>
	<br>
	We’ve also adjusted the magical jewelry that could be generated by fishing 
	holes in rare cases. After the treasure revisions, fishing holes were 
	generating jewelry that was much better than intended. We’ll be bringing 
	them back into line in May.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Ranged Attack Changes<br>
	</b><br>
	We had originally planned two ranged attack changes for May. After extensive 
	testing, we found that the projectile physics changes did not have the 
	desired results. That change is being held In Development until we’ve 
	finished a working solution. <br>
	<b><br>
	Speed / Accuracy Slider</b><br>
	<br>
	Currently, the Speed / Accuracy slider for Bow, Crossbow, and Thrown Weapons 
	allows the player to decide whether to attack more quickly at the expense of 
	accuracy, or more accurately at the expense of speed. At the far left of the 
	slider, the attack is fastest but incurs a 50% penalty to the player’s 
	attack skill. At the far right, the attack is slowest but gives a 50% bonus 
	to skill.<br>
	<br>
	We will be decreasing the penalty at the far left side of the slider from 
	50% to only 40%. The entire slider would then scale evenly from -40% to 
	+50%. This will allow players to fire at maximum speed with a better chance 
	to hit their target.<br>
	<br>
	This change is primarily intended for PvP combat, but it may be beneficial 
	in certain PvM situations as well.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Negative Spell Timers<br>
	</b><br>
	Currently there is a disparity in the length of negative spells across 
	different levels. Level VI negative spells last for 8 minutes, while level 
	VII negative spells only last for 4 minutes. In May we will be changing all 
	negative spells to the following times:<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">We had originally considered further decreasing

	<b>Healing Spells<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Please note that these changes are only for 
	these four spells, not for any other Life Magic spells.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Temple Quest Weapons<br>
	</b><br>
	Since the introduction of the Ixir Zi and Liazk Itzi Temple quests in March 
	and April, we’ve received feedback indicating that several of the reward 
	weapons were underpowered for their intended level.<br>
	<br>
	After going back and rechecking our calculations, we discovered that many of 
	these weapons were, in fact, not as powerful as we had wanted them to be. Of 
	the melee and missile weapons, only one – the Lance of the Bloodletter – was 
	as powerful as we had intended. In May, all other melee and missile weapons 
	from these two quests, at all levels, will receive improvements.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Ulgrim’s Bathrobe</b><br>
	<br>
	We received a lot of feedback asking that Ulgrim’s bathrobe no longer cover 
	your feet. A lot of people – a lot of people – wanted to be able to wear 
	bunny slippers with their bathrobe.<br>
	<br>
	As of the May event, the bathrobe will leave the feet slot open. We 
	recommend that folks not wear the bathrobe during the patch. If you do so, 
	you will have to relog to be able to put any items on your feet.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Content Revisions</b><br>
	<br>
	As we stated in the April Letter to the Players, in May we will be revising 
	the Palenqual’s Living Weapons quest. One note in advance – any 
	already-created Living Weapons will receive an upgrade, but this upgrade 
	will include a wield requirement of 250 base skill. <br>
	<br>
	We recommend that any character with an existing Living Weapon not be 
	wielding the weapon during the event if the character does not meet the new 
	wield requirement. If you do log in wielding a weapon and you do not meet 
	the requirements, the weapon will be unwielded. It will be moved to your 
	backpack if you have an open slot, otherwise it will drop on the ground.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Town Revisions</b><br>
	<br>
	We’ll be making the following changes to towns across Dereth in May:</font><ul>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The portal drops for many towns will 
			be moved to more convenient locations, similar to the changes that 
			have already been made to Shoushi, Yaraq, and Holtburg.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Many towns will be receiving more 
			convenient Lifestones.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Most Meeting Halls have been moved 
			to more convenient locations.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Distribution of mundane items – see 
			Treasure Revisions above – will be based on the level of the town’s 
			surrounding content. The greater the level of the town’s surrounding 
			content, the better the items that the vendors will sell.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Scriveners have been added to 
			several towns. Also, the scriveners in Uziz and Sawato now sell 
			level 4 spells instead of level 5 spells, as the surrounding content 
			is intended for low-level characters.</font></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b><font face="Arial">In Development<br>
			</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			(These are the game changes that we are working on for the June 
			event. None of these items are guaranteed to be added for June, as 
			scheduling and priorities can change. Your feedback on these topics 
			is particularly valuable.)<br>
			<br>
			<b>Allegiance Bindstones</b><br>
			<br>
			In June the Allegiance Bindstones should become active. Please see 
			the section above on this topic.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Improved Allegiance Officers</b><br>
			<br>
			The Allegiance Officer feature introduced in May is only the first 
			part of a larger Allegiance Officer plan. We would like to introduce 
			the following features in June:</font></p>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Three tiers of allegiance 
				officer levels, not including the monarch.<br>
				Allegiances would be allowed to have a total of 12 officers in 
				addition to the monarch. These officers could be assigned to any 
				of the three tiers. </font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The lowest tier of officer would 
				be the Speaker. The Speaker could use the allegiance broadcast, 
				allegiance chat kick, and message of the day commands.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The second tier of officer is 
				currently nicknamed the Executor. The Executor would have all 
				the powers of the Officers introduced in May – all of the 
				Speaker powers as well as boot, ban, and info. Executors could 
				appoint and remove Speakers.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The highest tier of officer is 
				nicknamed the Right Hand. A Right Hand would have all the powers 
				of the Executor and the Speaker and could appoint and remove 
				both Executors and Speakers. </font></li>
				</ul>
				<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Buffing Improvements – Item 
				Magic<br>
				</b><br>
				After accelerating the casting time of Creature and Life buffs, 
				we’ve begun work on the most frequently requested Buffing 
				improvement: Item buffs.<br>
				<br>
				Currently, our plans call for the development of new Item Magic 
				spells which, when cast, will redirect to each piece of armor 
				that you are wearing. Only Self versions of these spells would 
				be introduced. These spells also would not redirect to your 
				clothes.<br>
				<br>
				We will be providing more information on these spells as we 
				continue development.<br>
				<br>
				<b>PvP Weapon Changes</b><br>
				<br>
				In June we are looking at rebalancing the Weeping Weapons. We 
				would also like to introduce an Aegis-like ability that can be 
				added to loot missile weapons and casters. More details on these 
				ideas can be found in our
				<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=216">
				Future of PvP article</a> and we will be presenting more 
				specific information in the June Letter to the Players or sooner 
				if possible.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Content Revisions</b><br>
				In June we plan on several major content revisions:</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We plan to revise the 
					Gaerlan quest. We’d like to simplify some aspects of the 
					quest, remove many of the existing shortcuts and exploits, 
					adjust the rewards and if possible add a new tier of reward.</font></li>
					<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also be making major 
					revisions to Marae Lassel. We will be targeting the island 
					for a range of characters from newbie to high, with the 
					possibility of some extreme quests, and we’ll be changing 
					the landscape spawns and quests to match. In addition, the 
					towns on Marae Lassel will be retouched in a manner similar 
					to the recent revisions to Yaraq, Holtburg, and Shoushi.</font></li>
					</ul>
					<p><font face="Arial"><b>In Concept<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
					<i>(These are the game changes that we are thinking about 
					for July and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or even if – 
					any of these changes will be added to the game, as 
					scheduling and priorities can change. Your feedback on these 
					topics is particularly valuable.<br>
					<br>
					If not mentioned elsewhere in this Letter, topics listed as
					<b>In Concept</b> in prior articles have not changed 
					status.)<br>
					</i><br>
					<b>Character Starting Skills<br>
					<br>
					</b>For some time there has been a perceived imbalance in 
					character racial skills. Currently:</font></p>
					<ul>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Sho characters start 
						with Unarmed Combat trained.</font></li>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Aluvian characters start 
						with Dagger and Assess Person trained.</font></li>
						<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gharu’ndim characters 
						start with Staff and Item Tinkering trained.</font></li>
						</ul>
						<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unless a player plans on 
						using Dagger or Unarmed Combat, there is a strong 
						incentive to choose Gharu’ndim – Item Tinkering. Putting 
						experience into any Tinkering skill allows you to gain 
						more salvage when using an Ust on an item. The ability 
						to gain more salvage by putting experience into a free 
						racial skill is very valuable. Assess Person in 
						comparison is not very useful, and Sho characters have 
						no additional racial skill at all.<br>
						<br>
						Our proposed solution to this imbalance is the 
						introduction of a new skill: Salvaging. This skill would 
						count as a Tinkering skill for purposes of gaining 
						salvage from an Ust, but would have no other use. <br>
						<br>
						We could introduce this as free skill for all new 
						characters regardless of race (similar to Run and Jump). 
						Alternately, we could give it only to Sho and Aluvian 
						characters as having it on a Gharu’ndim character would 
						be redundant. <br>
						<br>
						This concept is still very much in discussion. We will 
						provide more information and request specific feedback 
						when it enters development.<br>
						<br>
						Regarding Assess Person, we would like to make both it 
						and Deception more valuable in the future – look for 
						more details in a later In Concept article.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Salvaging Improvements<br>
						</b><br>
						In addition to the skill changes mentioned above, we are 
						investigating additional improvements to salvaging.<br>
						<br>
						One idea that we are investigating is a “Salvage 
						Backpack”. This would take up a pack slot in inventory 
						and could hold a single bag of each type of salvage. For 
						example you could store a 2 unit bag of Steel and a 50 
						unit bag of Iron in your Salvage Backpack, or even a 
						single 100 unit bag of each type of salvage; but you 
						could not store a 100 unit bag of Steel and an 
						additional 50 unit bag of Steel.<br>
						<br>
						We are also investigating improvements to the Ust that 
						would allow it to salvage items of different material 
						types at the same time. Our goal with this is to make 
						salvaging less tedious for players.<br>
						<br>
						Both of these ideas are still in very rough draft form, 
						we’ll be providing more details as we continue 
						development on them.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Changes to Armor Imbues<br>
						<br>
						</b>We are considering making changes to the way that 
						the three Armor Imbues work. Currently you can imbue a 
						piece of armor to grant +1 to your Missile Defense, 
						Melee Defense, or Magic Defense skill. <br>
						<br>
						We are looking at possibly changing this bonus from +1 
						skill to a 1% damage reduction. For example, using the 
						Melee imbue on a piece of armor would cause all melee 
						damage done to you to be reduced by 1%. This reduction 
						would stack – if you were wearing three pieces of armor 
						with this imbue, melee damage done to you would be 
						reduced by 3%.<br>
						<br>
						Two notes:</font></p>
						<ul>
							<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Magic damage 
							reduction most likely would not stack with the 
							Sanguinary Aegis. The Aegis would always override 
							the armor imbues.</font></li>
							<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We would most likely 
							start with a conservative cap for total damage 
							reduction, probably 5% or something close to that.</font></li>
							</ul>
							<p><b><font face="Arial">Conclusion<br>
							</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
							There you have it – our plans for May and beyond. As 
							always, we value your feedback on these topics.<span lang="en-us">z<br>

	May 18, 2004</span></font></small><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the 
	last several months, we have received increasing complaints regarding 
	crafting money macros. These macros could be seen clapping their hands 
	outside shops in many towns.<br>
	<br>
	In the April event, we made changes to eliminate the usefulness of two of 
	the most popular macroed craft items: applesauce and potions. However, new 
	macros have sprung up in their wake. Recently the number of macroing 
	characters – and complaints about these macros – has increased dramatically. 
	In addition, we recently had an incident in which one player’s use of 
	multiple macroing characters on multiple accounts actually destabilized one 
	of our game servers.<br>
	<br>
	It has become clear that further action is necessary, particularly as we 
	prepare to open the new world Verdantine. In the past, we have identified 
	and fixed macroed tradeskill interactions as they were discovered. 
	Unfortunately, the cycle of macro – nerf – find new macro could go on for 
	much longer. Any changes to vendor buy/sell rates could introduce a new 
	problem.<br>
	<br>
	We have decided after much discussion to solve this issue with a larger 
	change. Starting with the June event, it will no longer be possible to sell
	<i>any crafted items</i> to vendors. This affects <i>all</i> crafted items. 
	Potions, arrowheads, food – it will no longer be possible to sell any of 
	these items to vendors. This is true even if the item was not originally 
	crafted by a player. For example, ordinary arrows can be crafted by players; 
	therefore no arrows – player-crafted or otherwise – are sellable. <br>
	<br>
	It is important to note that this we made this as a sweeping global change 
	to ensure that we didn’t miss anything. It is possible that specific cases 
	will turn up that will require us to make some items sellable again. In 
	addition, we are continuing to look for alternate solutions to the issue.<br>
	<br>
	While this is a major change, we believe that it will not impact the 
	majority of our players. Crafted items, for the most part, are created for 
	use in the field or for trading to other players. Players who craft items 
	for these purposes should not see any difference.<br>
	<br>
	However, we do see that this can create an obstacle for new tradeskill 
	characters, particularly those who may not have a patron to supply them at 
	low levels. These are the type of characters we are likely to see on 
	Verdantine. If these characters cannot sell the fruits of their labor, it 
	will be difficult for them to purchase new raw goods for crafting.<br>
	<br>
	To assist these characters, in the June event we will begin introducing new 
	NPCs similar to the Glenden Wood pacifists. These NPCs will provide pyreal 
	and experience rewards to characters for handing in specific crafted goods. 
	These rewards will be on a timer so that they cannot be macroed. <br>
	<br>
	The first of these NPCs will be targeted for new and low-level crafters, but 
	we are committed to introducing new NPCs for higher-level characters in the 
	coming months. In addition, we have increased the two lowest-level rewards 
	on the Glenden Wood pacifists. <br>
	<br>
	The team strongly believes that eliminating these money macros is in the 
	best interests of the long-term value of the game, particularly for the 
	opening of Verdantine. We believe that this change is the best way to 
	eliminate these macros without impacting the majority of our players, but we 
	want to ensure that new crafters still have opportunities for advancement.

    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">In June we 
    will be making a number of changes to the PvP weapon suites – Weeping 
    Weapons, Hollow Weapons, Deadly Hollow Weapons, and Phantom Weapons. Our 
    goals with these changes are the improvement of PvP weapon balance and 
    diversity. To that end many of the less-powerful weapons are being made more 
    powerful, and a handful of the most powerful weapons are having their power 
    decreased.<br>
    <br>
    Here is a summary of the upcoming changes:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Weeping Weapons</b><br>
    <br>
    All of the melee Weeping Weapons, including the elemental variants, will 
    have their non-spell attack and defense modifiers removed. The special Item 
    Enchantment spells on the Weeping Weapons that boost these modifiers by 18% 
    will remain. The Human Slayer bonus will be decreased 14% on all melee 
    Weeping Weapons – however, all non-sword Weeping Weapons will now have 
    higher base damage, allowing these weapon classes to compete better with 
    sword in terms of PvP damage.<br>
    <br>
    All missile Weeping weapons will have their non-spell defense modifiers 
    removed, but the special Item Enchantment spell on the Weeping weapons that 
    boosts the defense modifier by 18% will remain. The base damage modifier for 
    the Weeping bow has been increased, while the base damage modifiers for both 
    the atlatl and the crossbow have been decreased. Weeping Bow damage is now 
    comparable with Weeping Sword; Weeping Atlatl and Crossbow damage now more 
    closely correlates to that of the Weeping Axe and Mace. <br>
    <br>
    We are looking at decreasing the shield-hollow effects of the Weeping 
    Weapons. Currently melee and missile Weeping Weapons ignore 100% of the AL 
    of the target’s shield. We are considering decreasing this to 90% so that 
    there is now some reason to use a shield when fighting an opponent using 
    these weapons.<br>
    <br>
    Weeping Wands will have their non-spell Mana Conversion modifiers reduced to 
    1%. The special Item Enchantment spell on the Weeping Wand that boosts the 
    Mana Conversion percentage will remain. The Hunter’s Lash spell found on the 
    Weeping Wand will have a wider damage range of 70-180 (formerly 110 – 180). 
    The Human Slayer on the Weeping Wand is not being changed.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Hollow Weapons</b><br>
    <br>
    All melee Hollow weapons will have a 5% attack modifier, and all melee 
    Deadly Hollows will have an 8% attack modifier. All melee Hollow and Deadly 
    Hollow weapons are having their damage over time improved considerably.<br>
    <br>
    Also, all “Heavy” (Sword, Axe, Mace, Spear) Hollow melee weapons will now 
    have a weapon speed of 30, while all “Light” (Staff, Dagger, Unarmed) Hollow 
    melee weapons will now have a weapon speed of 20.<br>
    <br>
    The Hollow missile weapons are gaining a 6% defense modifier, and the damage 
    of Chorizite and Deadly Chorizite ammunition is being increased. The damage 
    modifier of the Hollow Crossbow is being decreased, but the average damage 
    will go up due to the increased damage on the ammunition.<br>
    <br>
    As both Hollow and Phantom missile weapons use Chorizite ammunition, we 
    found that this was the best way to balance the damage output of these 
    weapons. We set the damage on the ammunition and then balanced the weapons 
    accordingly.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Phantom Weapons<br>
    </b><br>
    All melee Phantom weapons are gaining a 10% attack modifier. Several weapons 
    are gaining a speed increase, and the damage on the Mace, Spear, Staff, and 
    Dagger is being increased. The weapon speed changes for Phantom melee 
    weapons are identical to those for the Hollow melee weapons (Heavy weapons 
    use 30 speed, light weapons use 20 speed).<br>
    <br>
    The Phantom missile weapons will have a 10% defense modifier, and have had 
    their speed adjusted. The damage mod on all three weapons has decreased, but 
    with the improved Choritize ammunition all three will see increased damage 
    over time. As was mentioned above, both Hollow and Phantom missile weapons 
    were balanced around the increased damage on the ammunition.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Conclusion</b><br>
    <br>
    In general, we have tried to improve all Hollow, Deadly Hollow, and Phantom 
    weapons so that they will be more useful in today’s PvP combat. Although the 
    Weeping Sword, Atlatl, and Crossbow will see a slight reduction in damage, 
    all other Weeping Weapons will have increased damage, making them more 
    competitive than they were previously. The difference in damage across all 
    weapon classes in PvP combat will continue to scale from sword (the highest 
    or most damaging) down to dagger (the lowest or least damaging), but the 
    differences between these weapons is now greatly reduced.<br>
    <br>
    Looking to the future, we have a lot in store for higher wield-requirement 
    weapons and casters, as well as new types of imbues. The ability to find and 
    tinker loot-generated weapons and casters that are comparable to or better 
    than the Weeping Weapons is in-concept currently.</font></span><p>&nbsp;<hr width="65%">

    <b><font size="2" face="Arial">Part One</font></b><p><small>
	<font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">The Eye of The Sleeping One had opened 
	in less time than it took to gut a Moar; Morgluuk and Torgluuk had seized 
	the opportunity for their race. Hundreds of years of servitude and abuse 
	would be rectified by fulfilling the greatest prophecy of the Burun. They 
	would cross the vast Pide and destroy the matron saints of the Fiazhat race, 
	a race that for several millennia ruled the surface of Bur and brought the 
	burning lands to cover the face of the world.<br>
	<br>
	They had acted swiftly when the coil shattered and the whir of the endless 
	tunnel hummed to life. Torgluuk, at the prodding of his brother Morgluuk, 
	called to their clutch, promised them glory beyond the endless tunnel and 
	incited them to the point of frenzy. Volunteers poured forth from the 
	youngest of the clutch, some no more than three years from their shells, and 
	they were sent in large squads into the tunnel.<br>
	<br>
	Since the Eye had opened, most of the clutch had taken to swimming beneath 
	the waters of the swamp and moving to the mire’s edges, where the Eye would 
	dry the muck into a soft crust. There they would rest, placing mucor stumps 
	between their lips and draining the intoxicating juices. Mucor only gained 
	its potency when the Eye drew across its hood. It was a delicacy enjoyed by 
	all Burun, and one that had been missing for one hundred and twelve years. 
	During all that time the Ruuk had been bereft of this taste.<br>
	<br>
	During their years beneath the world’s face, the Kukuur had developed a 
	method to grow the mucor in underground caverns and achieve the same effect 
	upon the mushroom that the Eye had on the surface world. Since the Eye had 
	last closed and wept, they were the only Burun to have access to the tasty 
	concoction; they were loathe to allow any other Burun to enjoy the taste. 
	Mucor was the most sacred of the fungus that The Sleeping One had gifted to 
	the children of Bur, as was evident by the change that happened when placed 
	in direct view of the Eye. Kukuur elders believed that the strength of the 
	intoxicant was too great for an ungifted shaman to control, so they 
	restricted the intake of the mucor’s juice to only the most eld: the six 
	masters. The Kings of Bur’s clutches.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, mucor was stolen on occasion by wily and unwise Ruuk youths. 
	Those who were not indoctrinated to the way of The Sleeping One would fall 
	into spasms that collapsed their lungs and ate their insides clean. Those 
	who were given over to The Sleeping One’s art would sometimes die in 
	horrific throes as well, but more often than not they would achieve a 
	euphoric state that made them nearly insensate. <br>
	<br>
	Cultivated or properly harvested mucor had quite a different effect. Some 
	remembered the proper ways to cultivate and harvest the potent mushroom; 
	others relied on the teachings of those with the memories of prior lives to 
	cut the fungus for them. Torgluuk was one who remembered. The lives he had 
	lived in the past ran strong within his veins and soul; the gifts of The 
	Sleeping One had only enhanced those memories and abilities. He had taught 
	his clutch to harvest correctly many years before, and this auspicious time 
	was the first that the clutch had opportunity to put his teaching to use.<br>
	<br>
	In the two passings of the Eye since the endless tunnel had opened, there 
	was only one death from a poorly harvested mucor, though many instances of 
	euphoria had been recorded. Torgluuk took great pleasure in that fact. It 
	meant that the teachings of the only noble Kukuur he had known were true. A 
	mentor, Tkrowerk, had once told him that splitting the mucor along the 
	center of the shaft before snapping the root clear of the ground and tapping 
	the top of the hood would drive the spores into the juice, where they would 
	dissolve into the fluid and bring the euphoria. He had taught this to his 
	clutch and it turned out Tkrowerk had not lied. <br>
	<br>
	Upon reflection, Torgluuk realized, the events of the past two passings of 
	the Eye had been Tkrowerk’s legacy. Tkrwoerk had taken Torgluuk under his 
	tutelage some eighty years prior. He taught him the black rites of soul 
	shredding, and the ways of the fungus. He taught him the language of the 
	Fiazhat, explained how the Kukuur kept control of the massive hulks, the 
	Guruk and how they kept the Ruuk firmly under their control. Tkrowerk was a 
	Kukuur who saw corruption within the hierarchy of the Kings, he wanted 
	change and for that insolence he was struck down and soul-shred. His 
	memories and knowledge lost to Bur, all save that which was passed to 
	Torgluuk. Often Torgluuk wondered how much of that knowledge had been passed 
	to him.<br>
	<br>
	In the violet glow cast by the endless tunnel, Torgluuk now sat in 
	contemplation. No others were present, and he cast his thoughts to Tkrowerk 
	and the things that he had told him of these days.</span></font></small><blockquote>

	<p><small><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">“What choices will I face?” 
	Torgluuk asked to the air.<br>
	<br>
	“Choices that will bring glory and immortality to our clutch.” Morgluuk 
	peered at his brother over the rise of the outcropping upon which Torgluuk 
	sat. As he came into view, Torgluuk saw the mud shell that covered his body.<br>
	<br>
	“Did you draw from the sidelong mucor?” Torgluuk asked.<br>
	<br>
	“No.” Morgluuk leapt into the air and landed in a crouch; the mud shell 
	cracked and splintered apart in several areas, exposing his deep purple 
	flesh beneath. “I felt it best to keep my wits about me. My savages are also 
	partaking only of the properly harvested fungus. We are aware of the Moar 
	moving closer. Three packs, underburrowers and breathers. Not the same fire 
	breathers with talons of ice that were coming before. There are a great many 
	more now. They hear the call of their mothers.” Morgluuk’s tongue shot from 
	his mouth suddenly and snagged a bomutur wasp from the sky. A mystical 
	charge sputtered as the wasp was quickly tucked into his gullet. “We need to 
	call the clutch together. There has been no word from those who crossed the 
	vast Pide.”<br>
	<br>
	“Yes,” Torgluuk nodded in agreement and tapped the edge of the koruu koruu 
	fungus. At once a brilliant blue light appeared beneath its hood. Above them 
	the Eye of The Sleeping One drew toward the horizon; soon night would fall 
	and darkness would consume the land. “I have already Pined the truth of why 
	they have not returned.” It was a lie, but Morgluuk was none the wiser. “The 
	Sleeping One tests us. Any who pass through the endless tunnel will not 
	return until the gods beyond have been swept clear. Only then can we return 
	to Bur and claim our rightful place over the Kukuur and Guruk.”<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk’s mouth twisted into a wide grin and exposed his rows of jagged 
	teeth. “I am pleased. How soon before we pass into the tunnel, brother.”<br>
	<br>
	“Soon, Morgluuk. First we must make The Sleeping One’s desires clear to the 
	clutch. Then we must make preparations to alert other clutches. We cannot 
	stop with this temple alone. Our subterfuge will not last and then the 
	Kukuur will follow us and try to strip the victory from our talons.” He rose 
	slowly and stepped to his brother. “Can you and your savages manage more 
	bomutur for a feast?”<br>
	<br>
	“Do you think we cannot?” Morgluuk challenged. Torgluuk placed a hand on his 
	brother’s shoulder and squeezed lightly.<br>
	<br>
	“See it done my brother. Tonight we discuss our plans for the conquest of 
	another world.” </span></font></small>
	<p align="center"><small><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us"><b>Part Two</b></span></font></small><p align="left">
	<small><font face="Arial"><span lang="en-us">The meal had been satisfying. 
	In the muck, the entirety of the clutch waited for their leaders to stand on 
	the branch of the muloo tree and speak of what would come next. Ugluur was 
	among them. <br>
	<br>
	Ugluur was a soothsayer who often led some of the younger chosen of The 
	Sleeping One in chants, prayers and song. He respected the ways of the 
	Kukuur and the hierarchy of Bur and had reviled the decisions made by 
	Morgluuk and Torgluuk since the tunnel had been opened. He knew that 
	Morgluuk held more sway with the Shaman than a lowly savage ever should. In 
	the interest of self preservation however, Ugluur had wisely kept his 
	thoughts silent. There was no reason to earn the ire of the leaders while 
	zealotry was so rampant amongst the clutch. <br>
	<br>
	He sat in the swamp crouched to his ears. The water was cool and chilled the 
	heat that coursed over his flesh. Unlike so many others within the clutch he 
	had decided to not waste his day caked in muck, sucking down the juice of 
	the mucor fungus. That was the province of the Kukuur and he had seen the 
	seizures that gripped the fool who had tried to harvest the mucor and 
	failed. He waited in silence. About him there were other soothsayers and 
	several warriors that would protect him should he speak his mind. They 
	thought much as he. He had quelled their tongues and saved them the wrath of 
	Morgluuk’s savages but this night would decide whether he could help them 
	longer or if he would need to let them suffer the fate of returning to The 
	Sleeping One’s mass.<br>
	<br>
	Several moments passed and then Morgluuk made his way to the outcropping. 
	From there he leapt to a vine and swung into the air, flipping twice and 
	landing on the branch of the muloo tree without a sound. He crouched there 
	and spoke.<br>
	<br>
	“We have spent hundreds of years beneath the girth of kings grown fat on the 
	power that flows so freely through them. They have kept us as the bomutur 
	wasp keeps its young; beneath the scum of the swamp, away from the seats of 
	power and legend. We rot here on the outskirts of Bur, while they sup on the 
	fattest fruits of the yola tree and enjoy the protection that our weapons, 
	claws and teeth afford them from the Moar. We have suffered for hundreds of 
	years, brothers; but no more!”<br>
	<br>
	The clutch cheered and croaked in assent, chanting Morgluuk over and again. 
	Praise was given to The Sleeping One and thanks for the return and opening 
	of the Eye. There was a palpable rapture washing over the crowd. For a 
	moment Ugluur felt it too. <br>
	<br>
	“The Sleeping One has called to us and we, The Clutch of Tkoruk Guruul, have 
	answered!”<br>
	<br>
	Another rousing burst of cheer spread through the crowd. This time Ugluur 
	could not fight the desire to cheer with his clutchmates and soon he found 
	himself chanting Morgluuk’s name in unison. Their voices spread through the 
	night and they knew that if there were Moar stalking them this night they 
	would think twice before entering the area of Tkoruk Guruul.<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk raised his arms and hushed the clutch. “Brothers have already 
	passed into the endless tunnel and we wait still for their answer. My 
	brother, Torgluuk, has heard the whispers of discontent.” Ugluur glanced 
	about him quickly, had he been discovered? A chant rose discounting 
	Morgluuk’s statements and Ugluur joined in emphatically. His head swam and 
	he realized that there had been something done to the bomutur flesh. “That 
	discontent will end this night!”<br>
	<br>
	Waves of chanting broke out in unison again. Ugluur sank beneath the surface 
	of the mire and swallowed a large gulp. What had been done to the bomutur? 
	Could it be the harvested mucor? Thoughts rang through his head with such 
	speed that he thought he might scream. The warriors who he once thought 
	would defend him with their lives now chanted for Torgluuk and Morgluuk with 
	such vigor that he feared they might turn on him for suggesting they fall 
	silent. They may yet know that he meant to subvert their claims and bring 
	word to the Kukuur. He shook his head beneath the surface of the swamp and 
	blinked twice before surfacing to hear the cheering fall to a dull roar as 
	Torgluuk walked to edge of the Tkoruk Guruul Temple and raised his arms.<br>
	<br>
	“Clutchmates! We have been gifted with an opportunity to prove ourselves the 
	greatest of the races of the Burun. We are at the center of prophecy and we 
	must heed the will of The Sleeping One and recognize that he has cast his 
	Eye upon this clutch, above all others!” He paused but kept his hands 
	raised. The gesture signaled that he needed silence. “Brethren have walked 
	through the endless tunnel and have not returned. This is true. But what we 
	did not know, we now learn.” The crowd listened with intensity, but Ugluur 
	was clearing his head. He mumbled spells beneath his breath and forced the 
	drugged meat from his body. <br>
	<br>
	“The Sleeping One desires the eradication of the false gods who scarred the 
	surface of Bur and allowed the corrupt Fiazhat to rule the world in our 
	stead! But this test is one that we cannot fail, or our souls and our bodies 
	are forever lost beyond the tunnel on the world of the Fiazhat gods, across 
	the vast Pide.” Silence still. Ugluur felt his body purging the poisoned 
	meat and felt his faculties returning. “Brethren, this is our task. We must 
	split our clutch.” Murmurs sprang up here and there, but a quick hiss from 
	Morgluuk silenced those foolish enough to protest. Ugluur’s mind was nearly 
	whole again now. “Some will accompany Morgluuk and I to the Clutch of Yurko 
	Utaal, the rest will pass through the tunnel and establish a home on the 
	world of the usurpers. There you will await our arrival. We shall join with 
	the Clutch of Yurko Utaal and make our way back to the tunnel to join you; 
	then as one we will overthrow the gods who would destroy Bur!”<br>
	<br>
	Torgluuk dropped his hands to his side and the clutch erupted in a frenzy of 
	cheers, chants and croaking for several moments. Ugluur hopped from the 
	safety of the swamp into the vines of a nearby toluu tree during the 
	reverie.<br>
	<br>
	“What of the Kukuur?” Ugluur called. The clutch fell silent. A low growl 
	could be heard coming from the muloo tree. There, Morgluuk bared his rows of 
	teeth toward Ugluur. “Will they be told? Or will you have us defy our 
	masters and purchase the shredding of our souls?” Angry croaks began in the 
	crowd and Morgluuk crouched to leap toward Ugluur. Torgluuk raised his 
	hands, and all fell silent. In the darkness, none could see who had called 
	out this challenge. Ugluur felt his heart beat faster and knew that his 
	breath had quickened, but he felt vindicated that he had made the stand. If 
	The Sleeping One saw this as his final moment, so be it.<br>
	<br>
	“The Kukuur have stood atop too many Ruuk corpses; they have made the Ruuk 
	shoulder their frailty and inability for too long. <i>This</i>,” Torgluuk 
	gestured to the violet glow of the tunnel, “is a sign of The Sleeping One: 
	the sign that we, the Ruuk, are his chosen. We will heed this call. The 
	Kukuur will learn of this in time and may well pursue us through the endless 
	tunnel.” Torgluuk paused and Ugluur considered his response. As he opened 
	his mouth Torgluuk began again. “But what will they find?” Torgluuk paused 
	briefly and then spoke in a deliberately syncopated rhythm “A world in 
	ruin!” Torgluuk’s hands dropped and the teeming mass of the clutch leapt as 
	one. Ugluur shifted uncomfortably in the vines, preparing to leap away 
	quickly. “We will go to the home of the Fiazhat gods, we will bring the 
	cleansing life with us and we will overrun all that world has to offer! 
	There will be none who survive! We shall scour that world clean, we shall 
	boil the entrails of Bur’s enemies and sup on their souls! We will prove 
	that the Ruuk are the true rulers of Bur and chosen of The Sleeping One!” 
	Torgluuk’s last statement was so loud that the Kukuur very well may have 
	heard it thousands of miles away.<br>
	<br>
	Madness overtook the clutch and Ugluur watched in awe and horror. Never in 
	his days had Ugluur seen such lunacy. Weapons were drawn and slammed against 
	shields; his clutchmates leapt from the swamp base into the trees and danced 
	as if possessed. The sound was deafening: a torrent of splashing water, bone 
	against hide, voices raised in alarming unison, chanting for Torgluuk as if 
	he were The Sleeping One. The cacophony did not dull; it rose to crescendo 
	and threatened to wane time and again only to begin crashing like the tides 
	of the great sea once more.<br>
	<br>
	Ugluur leapt from the safety of the vines away from the Temple of Tkoruk 
	Guruul. He leapt into a nearby moluu tree and heard the bone sword drawn 
	behind him. Morgluuk had given chase.<br>
	<br>
	“Where do you mean to go, soothsayer?” Morgluuk’s voice was thick with the 
	threat of murder.<br>
	<br>
	“I will warn the Kings and they shall come to crush this insurrection. You 
	are mad with power, you and your brother,” Ugluur spat back. He was not 
	afraid of Morgluuk, or so he told himself. <br>
	<br>
	“Ha! Your innards will feed the swamp this night and I shall hunt your eggs 
	and spill their contents. I will make that my makeshift casting of the 
	soul-shredding,” Morgluuk challenged. He leapt to within two branches of 
	Ugluur, but Ugluur stood his ground and drew his sickle and shield. <br>
	<br>
	“You will do no such thing.” The voice was Torgluuk’s. In the swamp behind 
	them, the teeming mass of Burun chanted, screamed and sang to The Sleeping 
	One and to Torgluuk and Morgluuk. “Ugluur will leave here with his head, 
	heart, soul and innards intact, my brother.” Morgluuk gnashed his teeth and 
	clamped his jaw tight. “Go join the others, Morgluuk. I will return 
	shortly.”<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk pointed his sword toward Ugluur briefly, then leapt down toward the 
	maddened crowd.<br>
	<br>
	“Why, Ugluur?” Torgluuk asked.<br>
	<br>
	“You are a shaman, not an elder. Only elders can interpret the will of The 
	Sleeping One. You overstep yourself!” Ugluur replied.<br>
	<br>
	“I say you have let the King’s poison enter your head so that you do not 
	think for yourself.”<br>
	<br>
	“Think what you want, zealot. You go against the very order of all there is 
	and expect that you shall live! You are the biggest fool that the Ruuk have 
	ever whelped and you shall be the undoing of us all,” Ugluur protested.<br>
	<br>
	“So you say.” Torgluuk crouched and remained very calm.<br>
	<br>
	“I could kill you now and end this madness,” Ugluur threatened.<br>
	<br>
	“You would make me a martyr, damn your soul to nothing and drive that mob 
	through the tunnel as one. My eggs would hatch with the knowledge of my 
	lives, but yours… my brother would find them and drink them. You would be 
	given the <i>pitiful end</i>.” Torgluuk shifted to a more comfortable 
	position. Ugluur inched closer. “If you so wish to end my existence and 
	spill my innards to the swamp I will not protest.”<br>
	<br>
	“You’re mad.” Ugluur shook his head in disbelief.<br>
	<br>
	“What you call madness I revere as enlightenment.” Torgluuk moved back to a 
	crouch. “I have spared your life this night, Ugluur. But I cannot save you. 
	You are dead even now, though you know it not. I promise you, my brother, 
	you will know all there is to know about the <i>Kings</i> and your place 
	before your soul is stretched thin and cast from all there is. That choice 
	is yours. I would have bled by your side and stood with you in victory 
	against our enemies on the other side of the tunnel.” Torgluuk shook his 
	head and Ugluur felt the rage within him giving way to fear. “Go. You will 
	need this night. I will need to appease Morgluuk by letting him set hunters 
	on you. They will be weaker, but still able to skin your hide.” Torgluuk 
	moved along the vine to Ugluur and placed a hand on his shoulder. Ugluur 
	lowered his sickle as Torgluuk approached. “I am sorry that it was you this 
	task came to, brother.”<br>
	<br>
	With that, Torgluuk turned and dropped from the vines and into the swamp 
	below. Morgluuk embraced Torgluuk when he landed and they were swept into 
	the mass of celebrants dancing in the mire. Ugluur spat down at them in 
	defiance and sheathed his sickle. He then turned and bounded through the 
	vines, northward toward King Browerk.<br>&nbsp;</span></font></small></td>
