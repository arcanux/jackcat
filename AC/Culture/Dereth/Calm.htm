	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=324">
	Turbine Site</a> (Dec. 4, 2004)</span></font></small></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius stepped into the portal and reality 
	was whisked away. The grass, sand and sky blurred into a streaked, purple 
	mess. His stomach lurched as gravity disappeared. The sounds of the birds 
	and surf faded to a bleak pinpoint of nothing. They were replaced with a 
	high-pitched whine that assaulted the warrior's ears. He felt light, 
	weightless; but at the same time, the walls of portal space screamed past 
	him at an incredible rate of speed. He feared what might happen to him 
	should he chance to float into those walls. Luckily, such a thing had never 
	happened. Still, the fear remained.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bile pushed its way up Antius' throat. No 
	matter how many times he used these alien portals, he never grew used to the 
	effect they had on his body. He hated the way this place made him feel. He 
	was a capable warrior - strong and fierce. But in this place, he was 
	helpless as a newborn babe.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius closed his eyes and concentrated on 
	breathing, though there was really no air here. Even so, it helped to focus 
	one's thoughts on those most basic of human functions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius felt something pull at his feet. He 
	recognized that sensation as gravity. His stomach began to settle as the 
	whine of portal space receded to the back of his mind. The sounds of birds 
	and surf replaced that whine once again. But this time, the birds were 
	different. He had never had the appreciation for birds that Elysa did. 
	Surely, she would be able to tell him what sort of bird he now heard, as 
	opposed to the sort that made their homes in the battlements of Elysa's 
	castle. But in her absence, he had to pride himself on the small 
	accomplishment of simply recognizing one trill over another. It was not just 
	the birdsong that separated this place from his island home, however. The 
	surf, too, was different here. It came from the west, rather than from all 
	around him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Welcome, Antius!&quot; Antius opened his eyes. 
	Jenavere stood a few paces before him. She made a small bow. Behind her, 
	Hendac pulled his sword from the corpse of a Banderling. He turned to Antius 
	and nodded his head.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius cleared his throat, acclimating 
	himself to reality once again. &quot;I see you've been busy.&quot; He nodded to the 
	Banderling's corpse.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You kept us waiting long enough,&quot; Jenavere 
	replied. She looked into the forest just east of them. &quot;This forest does not 
	want us here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius nodded. Suddenly, he remembered 
	something he had nearly forgotten. &quot;Oh, Hendac.&quot; Antius pulled a small pouch 
	from his belt and tossed it to the man. Hendac caught it and sniffed the 
	small bag, a great warm smile crossing his face. &quot;Elysa sends her regrets 
	for not sending this gift sooner. She knows how much you enjoy her 
	pearblossom tea.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The silent warrior tied the pouch to his own 
	belt. He clasped his hands before his mouth and bowed deeply.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I'll tell her you said so,&quot; Antius replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Okay, boys. Enough gift-giving,&quot; Jenavere 
	chided. &quot;Let's do what we came here to do.&quot; The three warriors turned and 
	ran north.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;When did it appear?&quot; Antius asked the man.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Gharu'ndim gentleman removed his fez and 
	scratched his head. &quot;We don't really know, my lord. There has been nothing 
	but ocean out there for so long that we rarely even look in that direction. 
	When I first moved to this fort, I thought I would spend all my time 
	meditating on the calm, deep waters of the sea. But after a time, even the 
	most beautiful surroundings become mundane, I suppose. Now, we spend most of 
	our time just waiting for passing travelers with whom to trade.&quot; Feruza 
	nodded to the robed man standing on the upper walkway of the fort's walls. 
	&quot;It was not until that young man arrived that we took notice. He is the one 
	who pointed it out to us. Now, I wonder how we missed it for so long.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius thanked the man and climbed the stairs 
	of the small fort's meager walls. The Sho man on the walkway held his robe 
	close. He coughed once and nodded to Antius, a broad smile on his face. 
	&quot;Good day, my lord,&quot; the man said. Antius nodded to him, then looked at the 
	mountain to the north.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He had been to this fort many times. Since 
	his arrival on this new world, his adventures had sent him across all the 
	known reaches of Dereth. He knew this place well. There had been nothing but 
	empty ocean out there the last time he was here. But those waters were no 
	longer empty.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A massive plateau of ice rose from the sea. 
	Beyond it, an island chain graced the horizon. Antius felt the breath leave 
	his body. So much land in what had previously been the barren sea. How had 
	that happened? Had something caused that land to suddenly come into being? 
	Or worse, had it been there all along, and they had just been unable to see 
	it until now?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius looked down at the two figures on the 
	beach. Hendac and Jenavere stared intently at the new islands. He wondered 
	if they were filled with the same sense of dread that he was. The three of 
	them had been through too much together to simply ignore these new islands. 
	Something had placed them there - or unveiled them. Something of great 
	power, no doubt. And if life on Dereth had taught him anything, it was that 
	beings of great power are often bent on great destruction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius pulled the gem from his pack. It was 
	time to report to his queen.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Light and dark swirled into a mass of 
	seething shadow as the creature's body twisted and popped. Its dark, 
	translucent form bled into a mass of muscled, gray flesh. Blood of red, 
	green, black, and purple flowed from the wounds which covered its new body. 
	The wounds closed, the blood stopped, but the pain remained. The creature 
	gasped as a mouth grew from its newly formed face. It bellowed a cry of 
	soulless anguish. The thing fell to its knees and wept.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A hand caressed the top of its head. &quot;Shh...&quot; 
	the dark voice whispered. &quot;This pain is temporary.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hand reached down and settled beneath the 
	creature's massive chin. The thing looked up into the dark eyes of its 
	master. It blinked and shuddered at the blinding light of the great one's 
	profane beauty. &quot;M-m-master...&quot; it stuttered.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes,&quot; the great one whispered. Its words 
	were oily and thin, wrapped in a sea of writhing madness. &quot;Master...&quot;</font></p>

	<p>He looked down at his flesh. It was still new to him. He both loved and 
	loathed its alien feel - its texture; its smell; its oils. So powerful, yet 
	still so flawed and weak compared with the existence he had previously 
	known.</p>
	<p>He looked at his brothers. He nodded to the youngest of them. The 
	changeling nodded in assent and ran east. The other two looked to him for 
	their own orders.</p>
	<p>He removed a map from his pack and unrolled it. He placed a large finger 
	on two locations. Each of his brothers nodded and began the trek to their 
	designated posts.</p>
	<p>He held the map to his blade of flame and watched the paper crumble to 
	ash. Then he began his own journey. For he, too, had a part to play in this

	Players!</p>
	<p>Over the last month in Dereth, the Burun Kukuur have mounted several 
	incursions in the depths of ancient Falatacot temples. Each time, they have 
	been repelled by the force of arms of Isparian heroes. </p>
	<p>Finally, King Browerk, greatest of the Kukuur, entered Dereth. Again the 
	Burun attempted to make their foothold on our world permanent, and again 
	they were repelled. With the defeat of Browerk, it would appear that the 
	Burun threat has finally ended. Again the heroes of Dereth have been tested, 
	and again they have prevailed!</p>
	<p>Now, let us look ahead to the December event.</p>
	</font><font face="arial">
    <div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>Changes to the Team</b></div>
	</font><font size="2" face="arial">
    <p>As we've mentioned previously, the Live Team has been in the process of 
	moving to Turbine's new Santa Monica studios, where we will work right 
	alongside the <i>Throne of Destiny</i> development team. The move is 
	complete as of today.</p>
	<p>As part of that move, changes have been made in two key positions on the 
	Team. Our Producer, Kim &quot;Mirin&quot; Payson, and our Lead Designer, Allan &quot;Orion&quot; 
	Maki, have both moved on to other projects at Turbine. Brandon &quot;meanbeard&quot; 
	Salinas, one of the designers for <i>Throne of Destiny</i>, has taken over 
	as Lead Designer of the Live Team. </p>
	<p>As for the Producer role, Sandra &quot;srand&quot; Powers is scheduled to return to 
	the position once development on <i>Throne of Destiny</i> has finished. 
	Until that time, the Producer responsibilities will be divided between 
	meanbeard, Executive Director Steven &quot;Ski-Dawg&quot; Kaminsky, and me – Alex &quot;Ibn&quot; 
	Beckers. </p>
	</font><font face="arial">
    <div class="headlineMedium">
		<b>Billing Migration</b></div>
	</font><font size="2" face="arial">
    <p>We're continuing our internal work on migrating all of you off of 
	Microsoft's .NET Passport and MSN Gaming Zone billing and authentication, 
	and on to Turbine's proprietary billing system and launcher. One change that 
	you may notice in December is that Asheron's Call will begin checking the 
	version of Internet Explorer on your PC. This is because we are using some 
	security features of IE for migration, and these features are only found in 
	IE 5.5 with 128-bit encryption or IE 6. </p>
	<p>If a sufficient version of Internet Explorer can't be found on your 
	computer at launch, Asheron's Call will prompt you to upgrade. For the 
	moment, you can cancel this upgrade and play the game normally, but be aware 
	that you will not be able to migrate without upgrading. </p>
	<p>There are a few things that you can do to prepare for migration. The 
	first is to make sure that your .NET Passport account is secure. We 
	recommend that all players change the passwords of the .NET Passport account 
	associated with their Asheron's Call accounts, you can do this at the
	<a href="http://www.passport.net/">Passport website</a>.</p>
	<p>This is particularly important for any account that may have been shared 
	between players in the past. If another player with access to your account 
	were to migrate it, that other player would be the account owner from 
	Turbine's perspective. Don't let this happen to you! Change your password at 
	your earliest convenience.</p>
	<p>We'll be putting out more information regarding the migration in the next 
	few weeks.</p>

    <p><i>(These are items that we plan to implement in the December event. Many 
	of these items were mentioned in prior articles. These changes are in 
	addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that we'll be introducing in

	<p>Before we say anything, let's stress again what's written above: Anything 
	you see in the Letter to the Players is <i>in addition</i> to new quests and 
	items that you'll be seeing in each monthly event. </p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		Masks and Guises</div>
	<p>As we've mentioned in previous Letters, the creature masks and guises 
	that traditionally enter the game in October were held back until the 
	December event due to resource scheduling issues. Starting in December, 
	you'll be able to find all your old favorites, as well as a few new ones!</p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Social Centers</b></div>
	<p>As also mentioned in previous Letters, over the next few months we will 
	focus on the towns of Holtburg, Shoushi and Yaraq. Our goal is to increase 
	player traffic through these towns, to make them more desirable places to 
	spend time in-game. </p>
	<p>In December we'll be making a number of improvements to these three 
	towns. These include:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Making the portals into the towns more consistent and increasing the 
		number of portals out of the towns.
		</li>
		<li>Moving the casinos closer to the towns.
		</li>
		<li>Adjusting the starter quests based in these towns.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to the three bullet points above, there are some improvements 
	that we can't mention here – things that players will discover over the 
	course of the December event.</p>
	<p>In the near future we'll be putting up a new article explaining exactly 
	what our goals are for the social centers, and the steps that we're taking 
	to get there. Look for that in the next few weeks.</p>

    <p><i>(These are the game changes that we are working on for the January 
	event. None of these items are guaranteed to be added for January as 
	scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are in addition to the 
	new quests, dungeons, and items that we'll be introducing in the January 
	event. Your feedback on these topics is particularly valuable.)</i></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b>Higher Wield-Req Weapons</b></div>
	<p>We've been teasing these for several months now and we're happy to be 
	able to announce that the first tiers will likely be added to loot in the 
	January event. These include new melee weapons with a 350 wield requirement, 
	missile weapons with a 315 wield requirement and magic casters with 290 and 
	310 War Magic wield requirements. </p>
	<p>The higher wield-req melee weapons will simply do more damage than 
	existing weapons. The missile weapons and magic casters will gain a damage 
	bonus based off a specific elemental type. For example, a 290 or 310 wield-req 
	caster might receive a damage bonus to all fire-based War spells. For all 
	other spells, it would act the same as a standard caster. </p>
	<p>We'll be presenting more details on this in the near future, before the 
	January Letter to the Players.</p>

    <p><i>(These are the game changes that we are thinking about for February

	changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and priorities can change.

		<b>High-Level Hunting and Life Magic</b></div>
	<p>An issue that's been raised by the community frequently over the last 
	several months has been an apparent imbalance in hunting at high levels, 
	particularly between mages and melees or missile characters without Life 
	Magic. </p>
	<p>The basic issue is that missile and melee damage is reduced by the 
	creature's effective armor level to the given element in addition to its 
	natural resistances, while war magic damage ignores armor levels and only is 
	reduced by resistances. This means that melee and missile attacks require 
	that the creature be Imperil'd to do the same damage as a war magic attack.
	</p>
	<p>The Live Team is committed to increasing the amount of high-level 
	hunting, before the expansion pack, as part of it, and after it. We're also 
	committed to making sure that all players have the ability to progress at a 
	reasonable rate, whether or not they have Life Magic.</p>
	<p>To that end, one thing we are considering is the introduction of a 
	high-level hunting ground or dungeon populated by creatures that are immune 
	to all non-projectile magic. This would allow us to give them an armor level 
	that is fair to melee and missile characters without having to worry about 
	whether or not the creature becomes too easy once Imperil'd; the creature 
	would be <i>immune</i> to Imperil spells. However, War Mages and Martyr 
	Mages would still be effective against these creatures.</p>
	<p>Depending on our research and resources, as well as your feedback, it is 
	possible that the first of these areas could go into the game for January. 
	However, it is more likely that this would occur in February. </p>
	<p>It is also important to stress that this is not by any means what we 
	would consider a final solution to the Life Magic/high-level hunting issue. 
	As we mentioned at Turbine Nation, we would like to re-evaluate the Armor 
	Levels of many of the creatures in the Valley of Death and the Caul. We have 
	other ideas that we're discussing as well.</p>
	<p>Now you're caught up on the Live Team's plans for December and beyond. 
	We've got some nice content surprises for you as well, but we're not giving 
	any hints yet!</p>
	<p>See you in Dereth!<br>

    (Dec. 17 2004)</span></font><p>Hi folks! As you know, we’ve been talking for 
	quite some time about the upcoming transfer of accounts from Microsoft’s 
	billing and login system to Turbine’s new billing system. <br>
	<br>
	Now we’re at the point where we have the details nailed down and can tell 
	you how things are going to work.<br>
	<br>
	Initially, MSN Gaming Zone accounts will be selected in batches for the 
	opportunity to migrate. If your account is eligible for migration you will 
	be prompted to transfer your account the next time you start up Asheron’s 
	Call. When you accept, you will go to Turbine’s account creation system.<br>
	<br>
	Once there, you will create your new Turbine Billing account and enter your 
	billing information. After your credit card is confirmed, you will be able 
	to download and install Turbine’s launcher. From then on, you will use 
	Turbine’s launcher and your Turbine account to log in to Asheron’s Call. 
	Shortly thereafter Microsoft will cancel the recurring billing on your MSN 
	Gaming Zone account; once that occurs you will no longer be able to log in 
	with your Zone account.<br>
	<br>
	As we said, initially migration will be voluntary and in small batches of 
	accounts, so we can slowly ramp up. As we continue into migration, we’ll 
	make the group of eligible accounts larger and larger until all players can 
	elect to transfer their accounts. <br>
	<br>
	For those who do not go through the transfer process when prompted, Turbine 
	will begin a required migration. This will occur sometime after voluntary 
	migration begins. Once we move into the required migration phase, you won’t 
	be able to log in to the game until you transfer your account to Turbine 
	Billing.<br>
	<br>
	That’s it. It’s that simple. You don’t need your original CD-Key; you don’t 
	even need to know your current Zone account name. All you need to do is log 
	in to the game.<br>
	<br>
	The one thing you do need is to be an active customer. You can’t migrate if 
	you can’t log in. If you are currently unsubscribed and want to 
	re-subscribe, just go to
	<a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscallxp/minilaunch2.asp">
	the Asheron's Call Quicklaunch page on the MSN Gaming Zone</a> and sign in 
	with your .NET Passport. Click “Subscription” at the bottom. If you have 
	issues re-subscribing or logging in, you can contact Zone Support here.<br>
	<br>
	Obviously, there may be some special cases or other issues that aren’t 
	covered in this post. That’s why we’re working on a full FAQ that will be 
	posted soon. The FAQ will answer questions about things like accounts that 
	have been banned by the Zone, accounts that you can’t re-subscribe to before 
	the end of migration, etc. We already have an
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fuzeqna.com/asheronscall/consumer/Search.asp?SearchType=advanced&amp;referrer=&amp;rfield=&amp;usertype=&amp;formaction=search&amp;keyword=migration&amp;match=and&amp;catID1=&amp;catID2=&amp;sortmethod=views+desc%2C+datemodified&amp;submitbutton=Go">
	initial FAQ</a> online in our Fuze system.<br>
	<br>
	So, last question – when does all this start? We’re currently shooting to 
	start the first groups early next week. We’ll definitely let you know if 
	this changes.<br>
	<br>
	We’re pretty excited about this last step in the transition of Asheron’s 
	Call from Microsoft to Turbine, and we hope you are too!<hr width="65%">

    <a name="billing2"></a>AC Billing Migration<span lang="en-us">: Important 
	Update From Turbine </span> </font></b><font size="2"> 
    <span lang="en-us">(Dec. 20, 2004)</span></font></span></font><p>
    <span class="Title2"><span lang="en-us"><font size="2">Turbine Entertainment 
	Software is ready to begin transferring Asheron’s Call (AC) community 
	members’ accounts to the publisher’s newly launched billing service. 
	Ultimately, every one of the thousands of Asheron’s Call players will need 
	to transfer their information, which includes account and character 
	information, from Microsoft’s Zone to Turbine’s new system.<br>
	<br>
	To complete the seamless migration of billing information, AC members will 
	receive a pop up message when they launch the long-running MMORPG, prompting 
	them to transfer their account from Microsoft’s Zone to Turbine’s billing 
	system. Once they are in the process players will be asked to re-enter 
	billing information to keep their accounts active. Start to finish, the 
	entire process should take players less than 10 minutes. Members who bypass 
	the initial pop up window request will eventually be required to migrate 
	their account – meaning they will not be able to log into the game unless 
	they complete the process.<br>
	<br>
	The Asheron’s Call community is Turbine’s first live service community to 
	transfer their information away from Microsoft. The Asheron’s Call 2 
	community will start the same process just after the New Year. As a 
	convenience to players Turbine expects to maintain existing billing dates, 
	so users should see no changes to their subscription schedule or monthly 
	fees.<br>
	<br>
	The billing account transfer is the final step in Turbine’s acquisition of 
	the AC franchise from Microsoft, a process that began in early 2004.<br>
