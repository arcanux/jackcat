    <span class="Head"><b>Dereth: Seedsow PY 13 / Earth: June 2002 </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    With homes available to all Isparians now, traditions from Ispar have been 
    given new life. Among the Sho, the tradition of leaving open the doors and 
    windows before moving into a home has resurfaced. Any bad spirits the 
    previous owner may have left can be released, so the new owner will not 
    inherit the problems of another. At times throughout their lives on Dereth, 
    many Isparians may have wondered, “How do you release the bad spirits from 
    an entire world?” With the appearance of Gaerlan, this question haunts them 
    once again. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following Martine's rampages of the 
      previous month, explosions early in the month of Seedsow destroyed the 
      Magical Essences located in the far-flung corners of Dereth. For months, 
      these Essences had instructed the people in higher-level magics, 
      transmitting the knowledge into their minds. Now the Essences were gone, 
      and the shattered Menhir Rings where they had once stood were filled with 
      elemental creatures. As if the loss of the Essences were not enough, the 
      explosions radiated along the lines of magical force throughout the world, 
      causing spells to lose the power they once possessed. However, there was 
      one welcome side effect from these explosions: spells now seemed to last 
      much longer than they had previously. Depending on a spell's power, the 
      effect could now last almost twice as long as it once had. Some felt that 
      this change in the duration of spells was a direct result of their loss in 
      power, but a definitive answer was never found. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately, Asheron's cooperation with the 
    Arcanum, which had started the month before, was yielding results to help 
    those dependent upon magic. Asheron was able to help the Arcanum find a 
    means to distill the components used by mages into objects called “Foci.” 
    This resulted in the Arcanum creating four distinct types of Foci, one for 
    each school of magic. These Foci, along with Prismatic Tapers, would allow 
    mages to cast their spells without the traditional components that they had 
    depended upon for so long. The Arcanum made another breakthrough, thanks to 
    Asheron's help. Asheron's people, the Empyreans, had left behind many 
    scrolls and tomes containing magical knowledge. Unfortunately only skilled 
    lore scholars could understand the information recorded in these scrolls. 
    With the insight provided by Asheron, the Arcanum found a means to record 
    this magical knowledge in a form all could understand. Arcanum Scriveners 
    almost immediately began setting up shops in various Isparian towns to sell 
    scrolls that all could read and comprehend. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In response to Martine's attacks and the 
    explosion of the Essences, High Queen Elysa Strathelar began calling her 
    people together at the Festival Stones found throughout the land. At these 
    stones she held ceremonies to symbolize that Dereth was now truly their 
    home. At the first stone, the Thistledown Stone near the town of Cragstone, 
    Elysa appeared with Asheron at her side and “lit” the stone. A cascade of 
    magical energy shot from the stone into the sky, delighting all in 
    attendance. Unfortunately, the proceedings were interrupted by the 
    appearance of Martine, who shouted protestations of his love for Elysa while 
    spewing hate for Asheron. After Martine killed several of her subjects in 
    attendance there, Elysa was forced to leave, but she bade that the 
    ceremonies continue. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Subsequent occasions were marred by 
    interruptions and discoveries, until Elysa came to the fifth and final 
    ceremony at the Midsong Festival Stone in the deserts of Dereth. The moment 
    the ceremony began, Martine once again appeared. At a previous ceremony, 
    Asheron had offered to heal the damage done to Martine by his Virindi 
    captors; now Martine came to accept this offer. Sadly, however, Martine's 
    unhinged mind reacted violently to a statement made by Asheron, and the 
    insane man lashed out, firing a powerful spell into Asheron's chest. 
    Mortally wounded, Asheron slumped to the ground, his lifeblood cascading 
    onto the desert floor. </font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">At this moment, Gaerlan appeared. Months before, 
    adventurers had found a text in a wrecked Gelidite Library. The author had 
    been named Gaerlan, and examination of this text had revealed that he had 
    been studying the ancient Gelidite Library, as well as structures called 
    “cisterns” which were located near where the Magical Essences had stood. 
    Now, this Empyrean materialized before the gathered people, congratulating 
    Martine on his attack. Gaerlan's very appearance revealed that he was a 
    master of the elemental forces: his breath was frost, his hands dripped 
    acid, lightning emanated from his head, and fire followed him wherever he 
    walked. Later, after they had time to ponder recent events, it became 
    obvious to the Isparians that Gaerlan had been their unseen enemy, not 
    Martine. Somehow Gaerlan had been released from portalspace and was 
    responsible for Nuhmudira's imprisonment, Martine's slide into insanity, and 
    the explosions that had wracked the Magical Essences. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the ceremony, Gaerlan barely 
      acknowledged the Isparians that immediately set about attacking him. He 
      simply summoned a titanic Crystal Golem to draw their attention as he 
      moved toward Asheron. Fortunately, Queen Elysa and her people were able to 
      divide their attention between the two, eventually destroying the Golem 
      and providing the Queen with enough time to cast a recall spell that would 
      return Elysa and Asheron to the protection of his castle. As the wounded 
      Asheron slipped through his fingers, Gaerlan howled that he would yet have 
      his revenge upon him. And as the Isparians continued their attacks on him, 
      Gaerlan realized the fondness Asheron had for these people, and proclaimed 
      he would destroy them as part of his revenge upon the man. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once again, the Isparians find themselves 
    inheriting a conflict started centuries before and only now reaching its 
    climax. But this time, they do not have their protector Asheron to step in 
    and aid them as he had in the past. Even those who have spoken against him 
    wonder how they will face Gaerlan and his hordes of Elementals without 
    Asheron's help. Yet there is always hope…or so the people tell themselves.
