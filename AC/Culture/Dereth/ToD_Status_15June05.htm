          <br>
          <font face="Arial">Hallo! Welcome to this week’s update on Throne of 
          Destiny’s development. The last week has been very exciting! We signed 
          off on our release CD candidate and shipped it off to our distribution 
          partners at Station Publishing and Codemasters for approval, which is 
          a very major milestone. We’ve got a lot of confidence in where we are 
          right now, and that confidence was buoyed by the feedback we’ve been 
          receiving from Closed Preview. <br>
          <br>
          The Closed Preview has been running since last week and has gone quite 
          well. One of the players involved remarked to me how great the game 
          looked. Later we realized that he only had his Texture Quality set to 
          Medium instead of High. He wasn’t even looking at the best graphics 
          that we’re going to be shipping with, let alone the textures we’ll be 
          releasing in an Event later!<br>
          <br>
          I personally had the thrill of logging one of my oldest characters on 
          to Destiny. This character was started on Leafcull way back in the 
          Fall of 1999 so he was copied along with the rest of the Leafcull 
          database. Let me tell you, even as someone who has been looking at 
          Throne of Destiny day in and day out for many months, I got a little 
          tingle when I took this character that I’ve been playing for five and 
          half years and ran him around Sanamar. <br>
          <br>
          But you’re not reading this to hear me go on about how much fun it is 
          to play Throne of Destiny. (Or maybe you are for some reason.) You 
          want to know how things are going. Things are going well! <br>
          <br>
          We are definitely still on track for the July 18 launch date. Open 
          Preview is going to start on June 22, if you haven’t read our
          <a href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=376" target="_blank" style="color: #D1D1D1 !important; text-decoration: underline !important">
          Open Preview Information</a> and
          <a href="http://ac.turbine.com/?page_id=377" target="_blank" style="color: #D1D1D1 !important; text-decoration: underline !important">
          FAQ</a> you should definitely check those out. Right now Closed 
          Preview is still ongoing, with internal testers, a small group of 
          players and the press logging in and playing the game. Destiny (the 
          Preview world) has been quite stable, with no server-side issues since 
          it went live. <br>
          <br>
          We’re also continuing development for the August event. We’ve set up 
          our development schedule in such a way that if any major issues arrive 
          from Preview or from Launch we can adjust accordingly to address those 
          issues in the August event. <br>
          <br>
          A couple important notes before I’m done:<br>
          <br>
          • During Preview, we will not be running any Live Events, scheduled or 
          unscheduled, on the live worlds. Our goal is to get as many of you 
          playing on Destiny as possible, and we felt that scheduling Live 
          Events on the live worlds would be a distraction.<br>
          <br>
          • I’ll be mentioning this again when Open Preview starts, but it’s 
          worth mentioning now. The default video settings when you launch the 
          Throne of Destiny client are not the highest available. Many of you 
          will want to tweak those settings upwards for even better visuals. 
          This is true for both Preview and the retail Launch.<br>
          <br>
          • While there is no NDA on the Open Preview, I’ve asked our largest 
          fan sites to hold off on posting full walkthroughs for Throne of 
          Destiny quests and content until we launch on July 18. Now, obviously 
          many of you will be posting and looking for spoilers on various fan 
          forums – that’s fine. I’ve simply asked that full, official fan site 
          walkthroughs not go live until the 18th, to preserve a sense of 
          mystery for those players who may not be active on the forums. 
          Obviously, feel free to post reviews, screenshots and the like 
          throughout Open Preview!<br>
          <br>
          That’s all I’ve got this week. Odds are no one will read next week’s 
          update – you’ll all be logged in to Destiny!<br>
