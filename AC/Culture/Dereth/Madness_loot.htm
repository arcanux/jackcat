    A Note on Majors</a> - by srand (Feb. 25, 2004)</span><p>
    <span lang="en-us">A note on majors:<br>
    <br>
    The general level range of creatures that can drop majors has increased. 
    That is, you may have found majors on lower level creatures before than you 
    will now. We may be revisiting this change depending on player feedback.<br>
    <br>
    The number of creatures that can drop majors has increased. Almost every 
    creature in the 80+ areas can now drop majors, which was not true before, 
    and the number of creatures that have an increased chance of dropping majors 
    is vastly increased. (Hmm .. That's a bit unclear. In short, creatures 
    generally have a small chance of majors, or a larger chance of majors. There 
    are now a lot more creatures with a larger chance of dropping majors.)<br>
    <br>
    The chance for a particular item to get a major cantrip has decreased very 
    slightly (about 1%). <br>
    <br>
    Overall, we expect majors to be as common or more common as before, but 
    spread more evenly over a greater variety of creatures.<br>

    On Loot Changes</a> - by srand </span><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <span lang="en-us">(Feb. 25, 2004)</span></font><p><font size="2">Just a 
    quick comment on this:<br>
    <br>
    The largest changes to loot were at the lower levels, and they were almost 
    overwhelmingly positive. More loot in general, a tighter range of wield 
    requirements (so less 325 wield req weapons for level 10s), a lot more item 
    enchantments, and a tighter range of spell levels on items, for instance.
    <br>
    <br>
    The highest tier of loot changed very little, and in a generally positive 
    way. (For instance, average workmanship on weapons and armor came down a 
    little bit.)<br>
    <br>
    One thing to keep in mind, though, especially when you are talking about 
    lower levels, is that a lot of the creatures that rerolls were used to 
    hunting dropped loot far above their level. I'm thinking specifically of 
    certain Olthoi here. This meant that a low level -- or anyone, really -- 
    could make a lot of money off of them fast, but that they tended not to drop 
    equipment that was useful for the level of players they were meant for. As 
    part of the overall loot rebalancing, these creatures were adjusted to 
    better fit their intended level. That worked out to more useful equipment 
    for those levels, but to anyone used to what they dropped before it may look 
    like worse loot. It's not worse -- it's just different.<br>
    <br>
    So, as I said before and as I'll say many more times today: if you were in 
    the habit of hunting creature X for some particular kind of loot, and you're 
    not happy with what creature X is dropping, try hunting some other 
    creatures.</font></p>

    On the Value of Loot Changes</a> - by srand (Feb. 25, 2004)</span><p align="left">
    <font size="2">I keep seeing this meme that value on loot has changed in 
    some drastic way. Let's talk about that.<br>
    <br>
    There were no explicit changes to the value of loot. Now, before you start 
    arguing with me, read this: there were changes to the underlying system of 
    loot levels to make them better match character level ranges. Since loot 
    level is the primary indicator of value, that's going to have some effect on 
    value in the field.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, loot level 2 still generates loot of the same value that 
    loot level 2 always did, but different creatures drop loot level 2 than did 
    before. (There are 6 levels of loot, by the way. I'm just calling them by 
    number here, but for reference 5 is what you used to call noble loot, and 6 
    is what you used to call sing loot.)<br>
    <br>
    What effect is this going to have? Depends on the creature. A lot of 
    creatures saw an increase in their loot level -- so we expect them to be 
    dropping more valuable treasure than they did before. This is especially 
    true at the lower levels. The bottommost and topmost loot droppers saw no 
    change in loot level -- and therefore no change in value. And certain 
    outliers -- creatures whose loot level was out of whack before -- are now 
    more in line with their intended level, and the loot on those creatures is 
    likely less valuable than it was before. <br>
    <br>
    Overall, we expect these changes to be fairly subtle. So what is everyone 
    talking about? Well, before this update a lot of people were in the habit of 
    hunting those outliers I mentioned above for money. Since the value of loot 
    on those creatures may well have gone down a bit, if you stick with those 
    creatures you may see a change in how much money you can make. <br>
    <br>
    The other change which is affecting value is that the types of loot that 
    creatures drop has, in many cases, changed quite a bit. For instance, Olthoi 
    used to drop a lot of peas. Now they drop more equipment and less peas. If 
    you were hunting Olthoi to collect peas for money, then you are going to 
    notice a change. <br>
    <br>
    Incidentally, here's something to keep in mind, and I'm going to be saying 
    this a lot: if you were in the habit of hunting creature X for a particular 
    kind of loot, and you're not happy with what creature X is dropping, try 
    hunting some other creatures. <br>
    <br>
    I noticed that in another thread, someone asked me if this means that they 
    can't hunt Olthoi anymore even though they most enjoy hunting Olthoi. Of 
    course not -- if you enjoy Olthoi than hunt Olthoi! But if you were hunting 
    Olthoi because you enjoy making the most possible cash each hunting trip, 
    then maybe Olthoi aren't your best target creature anymore. But, you say, 
    you can't afford to hunt Olthoi and still resupply yourself? Well, honestly 
    the evidence we have -- from player reports, from our tests, and from 
    playing ourselves -- suggests that this is at best an exaggeration. But rest 
    assured that we will be keeping an eye on the situation and closely 
    monitoring player feedback, and if it looks like we need to raise loot 
    values for some levels or creatures, then we will do so.<br>

    Missile Mods</a> - by srand (Feb. 25, 2004)</span><p align="left">
    <font size="2">The maximum possible damage mod on 290 wield crossbows went 
    up. The maxiumum possible damage mod on 290 wield bows did not change in 
    either direction. (Nor did the damage mod on atlatls, by the way.) <br>
    <br>
    Crossbow could stand a little bump in DoT (and it is a very little bump, we 
    know), but bow and atlatl are exactly where we want them right now. <br>
    <br>
    We also wanted to diversify the missile launcher treasure mutations a bit. 
    Previously, you could only find one damage mod per wield requirement on the 
    250/270/290 missile weapons. Now you can find any of four damage mods per 
    wield req. Crossbow, though, had less space between its mods on the top end, 
    so adding that extra 5% gave us a bit more space to work with in adding mod 
    mutations.<br>
    <br>
    Now, I'll admit that you *can* see this as a minor nerf if you try hard 
    enough. Your chance of finding a 130% bow has decreased slightly. However, 
    3% damage mod really doesn't make that a whole lot of difference in terms of 
    DoT or, more importantly, usability in the field. So what did diversifying 
    the missile weapon mods get us? <br>
    <br>
    Well, if you absolutely positively have to have a 130% bow, they are 
    slightly more rare -- and therefore worth more in player trades. And if you 
    are just looking for a good solid useful 290 wield bow, then your chances of 
    finding one have actually increased -- both because more creatures are 
    dropping 290 wield bows, and because the average workmanship of 290 wield 
    bows has dropped. So you are more likely to find a good 290 wield bow now, 
    although slightly less likely to find the best 290 wield bow now. <br>
    <br>
    Incidentally, here's something to keep in mind, and I'm going to be saying 
    this a lot: if you were in the habit of hunting creature X for bows (or any 
    particular kind of loot), and you're not happy with what creature X is 
    dropping, try hunting some other creatures. Loot distribution has changed -- 
    alot. But if you take a look around, I think you'll find that most of the 
    changes are beneficial, a few are ambiguous or sligtly negative depending on 
    what you're after, and some -- which we mentioned in the Rollout Article and 
    elsewhere and which we are working on getting fixed ASAP -- are really out 
    of whack.<br>

    Loot Changes Incomplete</a> - by Ibn (Feb. 25, 2004)</span><p align="left">
    <font size="2">I apologize for the delay in responding -- I want to make 
    sure I read everything before I jump in.<br>
    <br>
    The most important thing that I see folks forgetting is that the treasure 
    changes are <i><b>not done yet</b></i>. This is very similar to the creature 
    rebalancing -- many players were upset to find that their traditional 
    hunting grounds were no longer profitable, XP-wise. Then they found other, 
    new, hunting grounds that made them happy.<br>
    <br>
    <i>When the treasure changes are complete</i>, this will likely happen 
    again. There are a number of things that are VERY wonky in their current 
    state, because the changes are incomplete.<br>
    <br>
    All I can ask is that you reserve final judgment until you have seen the 
    final results. Changes this large cannot be done all in one month.<br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, try hunting in new areas, and checking out different 
    monsters -- you may be pleasantly surprised.<br>

    </font><font size="2">
    <p>We mentioned in the Rollout Article that the level of scrolls that are 
    dropping are badly out of whack. They have been for quite some time, but the 
    changes to loot this update really exacerbated that. We tried hard to get 
    the scrolls straightened out for February, but we ran out of time. They will 
    be straightened out with the March update.<br>
    <br>
    (As an aside: I've seen a few people ask why we couldn't do all the loot 
    changes at once. We're actually talking about thousands of data files, 
    hundreds of tables, and a big chunk of code. Our first priority was to make 
    the underlying changes that would simplify the rest of our work. Our second 
    priority was to roll out the changes in such a way that players would not be 
    completely inconvenienced for a month -- and in large part we succeeded at 
    that. Yes, we're getting a lot of feedback about the changes, but as I 
    continue answering some of your questions and discussing more details about 
    the changes, I think you'll see how most of them balance out or are overall 
    beneficial.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the sheer amount of work we are talking about, we also have a 
    number of interesting ideas that you won't be seeing for a few months just 
    because we need to get all the underlying work done before we can start 
    layering on the coolest new stuff.)<br>
    <br>
    Anyway .. back to your comment. Healing kits and other unmutated loot -- 
    like mana stones and potions or food -- are another area that will be 
    changing in the future. Again, they weren't very well synchronized with 
    character levels in the old loot levels, and they are even worse off now. 
    But this was an area where we were not as concerned with the temporary 
    out-of-whackness, in large part because the old system was so badly out of 
    whack to start with. What I mean is, the healing kits that players were 
    finding on most creatures last month were not, in the main, terribly useful 
    to the players finding them. This month they still aren't. When we get the 
    selection levels straightened out for healing kits in the near future, they 
    will be. <br>
    <br>
    Incidentally, this does bring up one point that one of the team made to me 
    this morning. Players are used to judging their loot by certain indicators. 
    That is, when you open a corpse and see a alevel 2 spell scroll or a poor 
    healing kit, you &quot;know&quot; it's bad loot. When you see a level 6 scroll, you 
    &quot;know&quot; it's not sing loot. It doesn't matter what the other items it the 
    corpse actually are -- you're past experiences have taught you to &quot;know&quot; 
    that these things are true. <br>
    <br>
    But with the treasure changes this month, what you know is true may not 
    actually be accurate anymore. So when you're looting this week, keep that in 
    mind -- even if you see a mere good healing kit on a corpse, that doesn't 
    neccesarily mean that the loot is terrible. Take a look at the other items 
    -- you're going to find that the weapons and armor have on average more 
    spells than they would have before, that those spells have a slightly 
    tighter (more useful) level range, that the workmanship is on average 
    slightly lower, that the wield reqs ranges are slightly narrower (more 
    useful), etc.</p>

    Things Have Changed</a> - by srand (Feb. 25, 2004)</span></font><p>Things 
    have changed. That isn't neccesarily a bad thing, but it is something you 
    need to be aware of if you are expecting things to be the same. We should 
    have done a better job of preparing you for these changes. Honestly, with 
    our knowledge of exactly what changed, we didn't expect such a negative 
    reaction. We know exactly where things improved, after all. But you don't, 
    and we should have better prepared you for that by sharing where things 
    would be better, and where things would be different.<br>
    <br>
    But hindsight is 20/20, and here we are now. So let's talk about some of 
    these treasure changes. <br>
    <br>
    The biggest thing we did was change what level of loot different creatures 
    dropped. Before, most of the loot levels were concentrated at the lower 
    levels (say, 1-50) and the higher levels had to get along with just a couple 
    of loot levels. So we redistributed loot levels so that each character level 
    range could have its own loot level, pretty much. This means that while a 
    mid level creature may have been dropping loot level 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 
    before, depending on the creature, it will now most likely be dropping loot 
    level 3. <br>
    <br>
    By itself, that would have been a nerf to most treasure, so then we went 
    back through and changed what the loot levels actually mean so as to reduce 
    any negative impact on players and increase the benefits of the change. <br>
    <br>
    In particular, we fixed up wield requirements on weapons. You can now find 
    wield requirements that better match the intended target level of creatures. 
    For instance, you won't be finding no-wield weapons in the highest levels of 
    loot anymore. <br>
    <br>
    We also fiddled with the spells that generate on items. Weapons and armor in 
    general have more item enchantments, and the levels of all the spells they 
    get (item, creature, and life) occur in a narrower band. In other words, 
    where you might have found an item with level 3, 4, 5, or 6 spells before, 
    you'll now be finding items with level 5 and 6 spells. <br>
    <br>
    By the way, as we mentioned in the Rollout Article, we're not entirely 
    satisfied with either wield requirements or spell levels at the highest 
    levels of loot, and we'll be working on these more in the future. But even 
    as they are right now, they are overall no worse and in several places a bit 
    better than they were before these changes.<br>
    <br>
    So, what else did we change? Well, those were really the only explicit 
    changes. (I'm not including here the small bumps in max damage to a couple 
    of weapons, by the way, but we did that as well.) Some other side effects 
    you may notice, however, include the fact that average workmanship has 
    decreased slightly, and that value may have increased or decreased slightly 
    depending on what creatures you were hunting. Average loot value stayed 
    about the same -- a little higher at low levels, a little lower at mid 
    levels, the same at the highest levels -- but how much cash you can make off 
    of loot is highly dependent on exactly what types of items a creature drops, 
    and that has changed on a lot of creatures. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, as we mentioned in the Rollout Article, the spell scrolls that 
    you can find on creatures are badly out of whack. In truth, they have been 
    for some time, but the changes this month really exacerbate that issue. We 
    wanted to get them fixed up in February. but we ran out of time -- and they 
    will be fixed up in March. Similarly, things like healing kits and potions 
    are a bit out of whack -- they were in the past, and we didn't help them 
    this month -- but we will be fixing them up soon. <br>
    <br>
    Incidentally, this does bring up one point that one of the team made to me 
    this morning. Players are used to judging their loot by certain indicators. 
    That is, when you open a corpse and see a alevel 2 spell scroll or a poor 
    healing kit, you &quot;know&quot; it's bad loot. When you see a level 6 scroll, you 
    &quot;know&quot; it's not sing loot. It doesn't matter what the other items it the 
    corpse actually are -- you're past experiences have taught you to &quot;know&quot; 
    that these things are true. <br>
    <br>
    But with the treasure changes this month, what you know is true may not 
    actually be accurate anymore. So when you're looting this week, keep that in 
    mind -- even if you see a mere good healing kit on a corpse, that doesn't 
    neccesarily mean that the loot is terrible. Take a look at the other items 
    -- you're going to find that the weapons and armor have on average more 
    spells than they would have before, that those spells have a slightly 
    tighter (more useful) level range, that the workmanship is on average 
    slightly lower, that the wield reqs ranges are slightly narrower (more 
    useful), etc.<br>
    <br>
    And I've said this several time already today, and I'll be saying it some 
    more: Things have changed. If you were in the habit of hunting creature X 
    for a particular kind of loot, and you're not happy with what creature X is 
    dropping, you may want to try hunting some other kinds of creatures. <br>
    <br>
    We're watching your feedback about this quite carefully, and we'll be making 
    adjustments as neccesary. Our goals for the treasure system are simple: loot 
    that is 1) interesting and 2) useful. We're not there yet, but we are closer 
    than we were last month, and we're going to be using your feedback to 
    fine-tune our efforts as we work towards our goal.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Edit: I need to make one minor correction. Because hiltable daggers and 
    shortswords cannot generate with wield requirements, you may still find 
    no-wield versions of these weapons in high levels of loot. Sorry for that 
    confusion.</p>

    I think I mentioned above, or possibly in another thread, that of our 6 loot 
    levels, 4 of them were bunched up at the lowest character levels and the 
    other two got strung out over the rest of the game. For various technical 
    reasons, its extremely non-trivial for us to add new loot levels, so if we 
    wanted to add any better higher level loot we had to redistribute the loot 
    levels. Since we have a lot of high level players these days, adding cooler 
    high level loot is going to be important for us in the near future. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, the bunching of loot levels at lower character levels, as well 
    certain irregularities in creatures at lower levels, made lower level loot 
    really hit or miss (and generally miss) for actual newbies. With a 
    downloadable client and an expansion pack in our future, we want to make 
    sure that the AC experience is consistently fun, especially for true newbies. 
    So this change made sense from that perspective as well.</p>

    <p>A big chunk of this was actually a problem before we made any of the 
    changes... one of the reason that we made these changes was to create space 
    at the top of the loot system where we could put new things as the game 
    progresses. As it was under the old way, we couldn't add something new for 
    very high level players without it showing up in loot that was received by 
    much lower level players.</p>

    On Phase I</a> - by srand (Feb. 27, 2004)</span></font><p>Yes, this is good 
    useful feedback, Falconoffury. Thank you. I'm glad Ibn pointed me at it. <br>
    <br>
    I did want to make a few short comments. These are to some extent all in the 
    &quot;this is phase I&quot; line of thought, which I know is not entirely satisfying 
    to some players, but I hope I can share with you what we've got planned and 
    why it's not done yet. <br>
    <br>
    First, you mentioned quite a bit about armor. I'm just going to say this up 
    front: we're not happy with armor either, but it’s a huge mess and it's 
    going to take us some time to straighten it out. This is one reason we 
    mentioned armor explicitly in the Rollout Article. In the meantime, it's 
    nowhere near perfect, but then it hasn't been for quite some time. We made 
    the decision not to hold up our other cool plans for treasure as a whole 
    while we work on armor, but armor revisions are on the way. <br>
    <br>
    You also mention the incidence of 'poor' weapon classes like dabus, tungis, 
    etc. in the mid and high levels. I agree with you, and in fact we're at work 
    on a change that will address this issue. <br>
    <br>
    Next, you mention spell levels on jewelry. Spell levels on items is 
    something else we mentioned in the Rollout Article, along with weapon wield 
    requirements, and for much the same reason. The distribution of both of 
    these properties is stretched further than we like at the high end. Let me 
    explain what I mean by that. We'd like you to be finding higher level spells 
    and a narrower range of wield requirements at mid and higher levels, but if 
    we follow that progression we end up with the highest loot having only 325 
    weapons and only level 6 spells -- and that's just not enough variation. So 
    we stretched the distribution of spell levels and wield requirements to 
    include lower levels of these properties at each level loot. What we really 
    need here is more levels of wield requirements and more levels of item 
    spells for higher levels. That's not to say that we are definitely adding 
    these things, mind you, but we are hard at work on a solution to the 
    underlying issue. And honestly we are very excited about some of the ideas 
    we are considering.</p>

    <p>That is exactly what we do. Right now, you will start seeing level 325 
    weapons dropping on creatures targeted at players of level 60. These weapons 
    may have spells of level 4 or higher. At higher loot levels, you will find 
    more 325's and the spells will be only level 5 or 6.</p>

    One of the reasons the changes this month took so long -- and therefore why 
    we didn't have as much time for other cleanup of out of whack things -- was 
    because we had to touch each creature individually to set the new loot 
    profiles. We built some tools to deal with the issue, so in the future this 
    will not be as much of an issue, but especially for this first run it is 
    perfectly possible that some individual creatures are not dropping what they 
    should be. I mentioned this in another thread, I believe, but if you find 
    something that directly contradicts what we've said the changes should look 
    like, please let me know exactly what creature dropped the loot and we'll 
    take a look and verify it. </p>

    <p>Oddly enough, this is exactly what we have done. And the ranges you

    changes. Of course, there may be some disagreement between us as to what 
    constitutes a creature aimed at a level 60 player, but we agree with you on 
    the underlying level to wield req correspondence.</p>

    <p>Nobles and Eviscerators are very close to the mid-high border, but both

    <p>You might try hunting creatures in the high areas of the landscape. One 
    thing that we may need to consider is lowering our mental cutoff line for 
    325 weapons (and other ranges) so that you can start finding these on the 
    highest level mid creatures instead of the lowest level high creatures. This 
    is something I will take up with the team today.<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"></p>

    <p>A high level creature also has a chance to drop a 325 with multiple level 
    6 spells and minors. There needs to be a variation in each range -- you 
    can't always find the best stuff. Having said that, however, I will also 
    reiterate that, as I mentioned above, the spells on items in the middle and 
    higher levels of loot are not where we want them, and we will be adjusting 
    them somewhat. </p>

    <p>Keep in mind that AC is not a level-based system. We are very much, and 
    we will always remain very much, a skill-based system. However, when we're 
    talking about skill levels it is very often a useful shortcut to translate 
    that into average levels. What I am getting at here is that if you have a 
    325 melee weapon skill, we don't actually care what your character level is 
    -- we know that your skill is high enough that you will be able to fight 
    creatures with a certain level of stats. As a shortcut in speech only, we 
    say that those creatures are targeted at a particular level, but what we 
    really mean is that they are targeted at a rough range of skill levels. <br>
    <br>
    In other words, if you can use a 325 weapon we expect that you can kill the 
    creatures that drop them based on your attack skill, and ignoring any 
    artificial shortcut names we've given them.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Action, this is also very good feedback. You've highlighted some current 
    difficulties for us (namely that we may need to drop the dividing line down 
    a few levels so that the highest mid creatures have a chance for 325 
    weapons). And you've asked some pointed questions that I hope I have been 
    able to answer for you satisfactorily. Thank you. :&gt;</p>

    <p>You don't actually want loot from one loot level higher, especially not 
    at low levels, because that's usually going to have wield reqs and 
    activation reqs you can't meet. What you really want is the chance to find 
    loot that's usable at your level, but better in the other ways that are 
    associated with the next loot level up -- so it's still no-wield but has a 
    higher defense mod, for instance. And that is indeed something we are
