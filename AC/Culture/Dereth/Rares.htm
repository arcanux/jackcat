		- Jan. 11, 2005</font></span><p><i><span lang="en-us">
		<font face="Arial" size="2">-by Jessica Mulligan</font></span></i></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
		<img border="0" src="ToD/191.jpg" width="160" height="240" align="left">It 
		started after the third drink at a Friday &quot;girl's night out.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Wouldn't it be neat, someone said, to 
		have very rare items drop in loot?&nbsp; Like, you know, r<i>eally</i> cool 
		stuff, potions that boosted your health 200 for a short period or a 
		pearl that increased strength by 250 for a few minutes.&nbsp; Now, wouldn't
		<i>that</i> be way cool?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Pulling my Cosmopolitan-tinted gaze from 
		the cute guy at the end of the bar, on whom I had been unsuccessfully 
		practicing mind-control techniques, I fixed my eyes roughly in the 
		direction of the speaker and said (somewhat snidely, it must be said), 
		&quot;Why stop there?&nbsp; Why not a healing kit with a +500 skill modifier or a 
		dye pot that never fails?&nbsp; How about foolproof salvage for perfect 
		imbues?&nbsp; And no&nbsp;skill or level restrictions; anyone can use any rare 
		item, whether they be a level 1 player or level 126-plus.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Exactly!&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is how Frankenstein was born.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day, while downing prodigious 
		amounts of orange juice and aspirin and trying to explain again to my 
		steady why he had to come get me at a bar at 2am, I remembered that 
		conversation.&nbsp; The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea.&nbsp; 
		The advantages were obvious: a way to reinvigorate the in-game economy, 
		a new class of items we could add to every month, something to help push 
		the lore along occasionally.&nbsp; And it would be just plain fun to come up 
		with the items.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, there would be potential 
		downsides, too.&nbsp; We've been reading the threads in which you've been 
		commenting about the plan for rares and we agree that there are some 
		issues with the plan as it exists now.&nbsp; For example, balance will be a 
		tricky issue; we wouldn't want to make a one-shot-kill weapon, for 
		example, or PvP would become an absolute joke and never able to be 
		balanced again.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">And if rare items were only found in 
		loot, then UCMers would have a natural advantage in finding them.&nbsp; Heck, 
		it would encourage pharming just to get the items to sell on eBay.&nbsp; 
		There isn't much more we can do about UCMs than we are already doing, 
		e.g. find and ban them.&nbsp; However, we can do something about making sure 
		the hunt for rares doesn't become a pharmer's paradise.&nbsp; We've put our 
		heads together and come up with a two-pronged approach, which we now 
		propose to you for discussion:</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Rare items from loot will be <i>
		rare</i>.</font></b><font size="2"> </font></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The easiest thing to do would be to pull 
		rare items out of loot drops altogether.&nbsp; However, we feel there ought 
		to be at least a small chance of finding a rare in a loot drop, even if 
		it is a <i>really </i>small chance.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At Turbine Nation, we gave some figures 
		for how often rare items would drop in loot.&nbsp; Throw those numbers out 
		the window; loot rares are going to be a whole lot harder to find than 
		that, as much as an order of magnitude more difficult to find.&nbsp; This 
		ought to keep the pharmers from monopolizing rare items from loot drops; 
		the 'ROI' (Return on Investment) of pharming for rares will be very, 
		very low.&nbsp; In this case, the time investment spent to acquire even one 
		rare by pharming will be extreme, so there won't be much sense in trying 
		to create a business out of it.</font></p>
		<p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">For the Future: Everyone gets a 
		chance.</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the rares implementation for <i>
		Throne of Destiny</i> is just about complete, we're considering an 
		improvement to the system that we could add shortly after launch as part 
		of a monthly update. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We want everyone to have a chance to find 
		a rare, on a more or less equal footing.&nbsp; In fact, we'd like you to have 
		a small chance of finding a rare item every day that you log in – and I 
		do mean small; they are called 'rare' for a reason.&nbsp; What we propose is 
		that each day, when you log in for the first time in a 24 hour period, 
		there will be an invisible die roll.&nbsp; If your number comes up for 
		receiving a rare, you'll see a special message, such as &quot;You feel 
		especially lucky today!&nbsp; You might want to go to the nearest Temple of 
		Rares and consult a priestess.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you receive that message, you'll need 
		to go to a special temple or other building we'll set up in each of the 
		starter cities, where a priestess (or Guide or Acolyte or whatever) will 
		guide you to a special chest.&nbsp; When you open the chest, you'll receive 
		your rare item.&nbsp; As to which rare you receive from the chest: that will 
		be random chance.&nbsp; You could get a tier 1 item, you could get a tier 5 
		item, you might get something in between; you just never know.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only limitation here is that every 
		character only has one chance to get lucky every 24 hour period.&nbsp; For 
		example, if you log in 15 times in one day, you don't have 15 chances to 
		be awarded a rare; you only have one chance, the first time you log in.&nbsp; 
		It also works in the reverse; if you don't log in for three days, you 
		still only get one chance the next time you log in, not three.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, this is in addition to finding 
		rares on loot. Active hunters will still have a better chance of finding 
		a rare than those who do not hunt, but that chance will be much smaller 
		than initially presented.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we said, this new system would <i>not</i> 
		be in the initial release of <i>Throne of Destiny</i>, but would follow 
		shortly afterwards as part of a monthly event.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, after reading your comments and 
		contemplating on them, that's our current thinking on rare items.&nbsp; Now 
		we want to know your opinions.&nbsp; Fire away; I have on my rare Level 5 
		Everlasting Pantaloons of Fire Resistance.</font></p>
