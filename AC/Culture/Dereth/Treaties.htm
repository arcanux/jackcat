	(July 9, 2004)</span></font></small></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Thunder shook the hall. Niarltah paused 
	mid-stride and looked toward the nearest window. Outside, trees bent toward 
	the ground in honor of the wind that threatened to tear their roots from the 
	ground. Further down the hall, Muldaveus’ booming voice drowned out the roar 
	of the wind. The Lugian was still howling about their defeat at the hands of 
	the Isparians.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Niarltah was more concerned with how the 
	Isparians had come to know that they were meeting with the Burun. They had 
	taken several precautions in releasing the information of that meeting and 
	still the Isparians arrived within moments of the treaty’s ratification. The 
	Burun had taken the assault in stride, leaving when called upon to retreat; 
	then the ill-tempered Burun, Morgluuk, had taken his leave. Torgluuk 
	remained behind to discuss the further implications of the treaty.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Torgluuk was proving a quick study of the 
	languages of this world. He had learned the common tongue of the humans and 
	was beginning to learn the intricacies of the Lugian language as well. 
	However, the Tumerok language was beyond the Burun’s capacity. Too often the 
	Burun’s inflection would make the words take on an entirely new meaning. 
	Niarltah had asked Torgluuk to refrain from speaking the Tumerok language, 
	as he had asked Muldaveus two years prior. They had all settled on the 
	common language of the Isparians. Though they despised the creatures, the 
	Isparian language was simpler. Plus, there was no loss of pride when someone 
	mistakenly butchered such a base tongue. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the moment, Torgluuk was on the other side 
	of the door at the end of the hall, a patient audience to Muldaveus’ 
	childish rant. Niarltah glanced back to the storm and shook his head. <i>How 
	long can the tree bend before the storm shatters its spine?</i> </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He approached the door and pushed it open.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Muldaveus took great strides before the fire, 
	his shadow dancing along the wall like a giant caricature of himself. 
	Niarltah smiled in spite of the Lugian’s ramblings and outbursts. Torgluuk 
	was stoic in a dark corner, preferring to distance himself from the flames. 
	A squat mushroom on the floor before him gave off a soft blue glow. Small 
	trails of spores trailed from the fungus and made their way to the Burun’s 
	head. Torgluuk inhaled the spores into a series of holes on the top of his 
	head and the side of his mouth. Niarltah wondered what the fungus did for 
	the Burun. He had tasted the fungal bloom and was not aware of any changes 
	in his own body. Priests and shaman had asked the spirits what the purpose 
	of the spores was and learned nothing.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As he closed the doors behind him, Niarltah 
	looked to Muldaveus and motioned to a stone slab that served as the Lugian’s 
	chair. Torgluuk scooped the fungus from the floor and hopped to the table 
	where Niarltah was sitting.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Where is your brother?” Niarltah asked, 
	looking pointedly at Torgluuk.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“We look for other places where our race is 
	trapped,” Torgluuk replied in his croaking voice.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Niarltah nodded as Muldaveus began, “What 
	now? How did they learn of our plans? I want answers and heads!”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Niarltah calmly turned to the Lugian. “We’ll 
	have answers when we all start to remain calm.” He stared at Muldaveus for a 
	long moment. The Lugian lowered his eyes and gave a resigned grunt. Torgluuk 
	seemed nonplussed by the short disagreement. Niarltah wondered if the alien 
	creature noticed the staredown at all. The Burun gave no indication that the 
	temperament of the discussion had unnerved him. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Niarltah smoothed his bandoleer, leaned 
	forward, and began the nightly conference.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finn crested a hill and checked his pack. His 
	food was running low and his water supply was nearly gone. The journey had 
	taken him a great deal longer than he had planned.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well Finn, you’re the one that said no using 
	item magic,” he chuckled at his personal joke and took a piece of bread from 
	his pack, placing it on the back of his shield. The air whipped in from the 
	north and the stench of death weighed heavy on the wind. “North of here is 
	no good. That’s the valley they keep talking about at the mansion. You’re 
	having a hard enough time finding your way through the Direlands, no reason 
	to go looking for death there.”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He looked up at the sun and removed his helm. 
	Sweat beaded on his forehead. He wiped his hand across his brow to clear the 
	sweat before it fell into his eye. He turned the helmet over in his hands 
	and placed it on the ground, using it as a makeshift seat. Scooping up his 
	shield, he settled in for a light lunch and took a bite of the dry bread.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“At least it’s a nice day, Finny.” He said to 
	himself as he munched happily on his food. As he swallowed he felt a tremor, 
	minor at first, then growing in intensity until it knocked him from his 
	helmet to the soft sand beneath. “What on Dereth?”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He clamored to his feet and watched as the 
	sand from a nearby peak tumbled down toward the flatter sand dunes. He could 
	hear a bubbling sound, like water being displaced. He knelt and took his 
	helm up from the ground, turned it over to empty the sand and then slid it 
	onto his head. The ground shook again, less violently this time, and he 
	grabbed his pack and strapped it across his back. A groan sounded about him 
	like stone moving against the earth and then the world became silent save 
	for the sound of rocks and sand sliding down nearby slopes. Taking up his 
	shield he set about finding the source of the tremor and the sound. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“…and they said I was crazy for making my way 
	around Dereth without the use of portals. Well this wonder is all Finn 
	Skigg’s, ladies and gentlemen. All mine, indeed.” He began to walk to the 
	south and east where he thought the tremor originated.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He hadn’t traveled far when he caught sight 
	of the valley crested between four spires. The interior of the valley was 
	lush, green and verdant. Trees stretched out of the valley and supped at the 
	edge of what appeared to be a fetid pond. But this was not as surprising as 
	what stood in the water.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Stretching from the dull blue-green pond was 
	a building like none he had seen before. It protruded twenty—perhaps thirty 
	feet out of the water and bore a resemblance to the Empyrean buildings that 
	were scattered across all of Dereth. He looked at the back of the building 
	and was struck with a great sense of wonder. He took a step toward the 
	valley and found himself looking for purchase on the shifted silt of the 
	landscape. The loose gravel and sand failed to support his weight, and he 
	tumbled forward. He came to a sudden crash at the bottom of the pit. The 
	taste of blood filled his mouth and his head felt fuzzy. He struggled to 
	right himself and stretched his legs out in front of him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He undid his pack and placed it on the ground 
	beneath a nearby tree and organized his thoughts. “All right, you fell in. 
	Not a problem. There’s bound to be a way out of this place.” He began to 
	scan the valley for signs of egress as he rose to his feet and dusted off 
	his armor. Everywhere he looked, he saw steep walls that would allow no 
	purchase, and his eyes kept sliding to the enormous structure that dominated 
	the center of the valley. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Well, Finn. What now?” He walked toward the 
	structure. “I say we walk up those steps and see what this place has to 
	offer.”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He strapped his shield to his arm and 
	withdrew his mace. Tentatively, he made his way to the steps that lead up 
	the front of the building. Time had worn away much of the intricacy and 
	stonework along the walls of the structure but it was still soundly intact. 
	The smell of rot and swamp were unmistakable but he was beyond fear at this 
	point. Curiosity drove him further up the stairs and to the crest of the 
	first level. His eyes caught the glint of something shining on the edge of 
	the structure, just at the top of the next stairs. He slid his mace back 
	into his belt loop and started upward.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As he took his first step he heard a sound 
	that froze his heart within his chest. It was the sound of suffering given 
	voice, the sound of death claiming another victim and yet, not giving that 
	victim absolute release. He wheeled and tried to draw his mace but it was 
	too late. A leather bound hand cracked him across the jaw and broke teeth 
	free. He crashed to the ground as a foot slammed into his ankle, snapping it 
	as he fell backwards. His sight went white with pain and he fell hard 
	against the ancient stone. As he looked up he saw a head, bound in leather 
	swathing, lean toward him and breathe stale air from a vertical slit in what 
	should have been a face. He felt something slip between his ribs and then 
	the spiral whirl of portal space overtook him.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He rubbed at his arms as he made the final 
	turn and looked inside his new home. Age was finally catching up with him 
	and though he knew that his time was limited he wanted to make sure that he 
	could still achieve the glory of his youth. He dropped the stock of the 
	crossbow against his leg and pulled the string taught against the latch. He 
	rested a bolt into the runnel and brought the weapon against his shoulder. 
	In the distance, he could barely make out the silhouette of the target he 
	had placed. He narrowed his eye and let the bolt fly.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He watched as the bolt sailed through the air 
	and slapped into the dust a few feet before the target. He let out a grunt 
	and wandered inside, disgusted at himself. At least he still had his secrets 
	to share. Nothing to do now but wait. They’d come…he’d made certain that 
	they would.<br>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fanzen San walked quietly back into the 
	Hebian-to library. He had spent the better part of a week traveling along 
	the shores and inland areas of the Vesayen Islands. He was tired and worn 
	out from a long, yet fruitful trip. The trip had been something that he 
	meant to do for years now, but time had never been in surplus. But recent 
	events, witnessed just outside of the city, had given him a reason to 
	venture out into the wilds of the island.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He returned to the confines of the library a 
	little wiser and little better worn for his efforts. He knew that others 
	would follow his steps and would be pleased with his findings.</font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Many of this month’s changes have already 
	been described in detail in the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=253">
	Letter to the Players</a>. There are three other topics that we’d like to 
	discuss in detail.</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Gibbering Claws</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this month’s event we have added a quest 
	timer to the Gibbering Claw, to make it difficult for players to prevent 
	other players from getting a Claw. This does affect existing Claws. If you 
	pick up a Claw – even one you currently own – you will not be able to pick 
	up any other Claw for 14 days. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Example: I have a Gibbering Claw on my 
	character, and another one in my residential quarter’s chest. If I put the 
	Claw in my inventory on the ground and then pick it back up, I will not be 
	able to pick up the Claw in my chest for 14 days. However I will be able to 
	drop and pick up the first Claw again as many times as I like.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Software Mode</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of this month’s new dungeons uses new and 
	more detailed graphics for some items that will not display properly if you 
	are playing Asheron’s Call without hardware 3D video acceleration. After an 
	informal poll last month, we felt that this is acceptable. Players without 
	hardware 3D acceleration will still be able to enter this dungeon, acquire 
	the items, and play normally; they simply will see flat colored polygons 
	instead of the expected item textures.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We may introduce more items like these in the 
	near future, and we’ll be presenting more information on the topic of 
	Software Mode soon.</font></p>

	We’ll be revealing exciting details about the upcoming Asheron’s Call 
	expansion pack, having Q&amp;A sessions, giving away door prizes, and sitting 
	down for lunch with our players in the annual Asheron’s Call Player

		creatures that spawn if silence is broken will reset the room. </font>

		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Gaerlan’s health regeneration has been 
		decreased at all four level breaks of the quest. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The spawn rate on the Homunculus has

		collectors. No more failing to hand in that Wasp Wing because the 
		collector is yawning! </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">It was possible to use hooked items many 
		times in a row, very rapidly. This could cause strange behavior from 
		some hooked objects, so hooked items now have a delay similar to that 
		found on NPCs. This change will also allow us to expand the sorts of 
		things that hooked items can do in the future. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Loot weapons that cannot be imbued now 
		state as such explicitly when identified. This currently only applies to

		overrun by Burun is now known as the Burun Cathedral. </font></li>

		been rebalanced for characters from levels 20 to 30. </font></li>

		multiple players. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Spiketails were intended to be made 
		unsellable with all other player-craftable items in June, but were 
		missed. They are now properly unsellable. </font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Bronze Statues in towns now behave

		<p align="left"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">28-Jun-2004<br>
&nbsp;</font></i></div>
	<div class="bodyTextMedium">
		<font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to the July Letter to the Players!</font><p>
		<font size="2" face="Arial">Last month in Dereth, Isparians continued to 
		fight against the growing Burun/Renegade alliance. Renegade and Burun 
		camps were discovered across the land, and each one became the site of a 
		pitched battle. New discoveries by the Arcanum have cut down on the time 
		required to prepare for a fight and made it easier for allegiances to 
		rally together in towns. But will this be enough to defeat this new 
		threat, when the Burun leaders have powerful magic, fierce warriors, and 
		strong allies already familiar with our tactics and weaknesses?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before we take a look at the changes 
		coming for the July event, there are three other topics I’d like to 
		discuss.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Verdantine</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We’d just like to thank all of you who 
		helped us make the Verdantine launch a success. While there were 
		certainly a few rough patches, we’ve seen folks having a <i>lot</i> of 
		fun starting over again. It was fun for us too! Not just as developers 
		watching our players having fun, but also as players ourselves running 
		around the new world. Who knows, maybe that person you fellowed with 
		last night was a member of the Live Team...</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Billing Migration</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Jessica mentioned in her latest
		<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=251">
		Transition Diary</a>, we’re in the process of writing up documentation 
		and FAQs for the upcoming migration. We expect to be able to post this 
		information in the near future. To restate for emphasis: We’re taking 
		our time with this because we need to be as careful as possible.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To that end, in the coming months more of 
		our Engineering and Quality Assurance resources are going to be 
		dedicated to the billing migration. I mention this because it means that 
		fewer of our In Concept topics will be moving to In Development. The 
		success of the migration is quite simply higher priority.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Turbine Nation 2004</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our Turbine Nation schedule is posted and 
		registration is underway! Both of these and more can be found at our
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.turbinenation.com/">Turbine Nation 
		website</a>. There will be information about the upcoming Expansion 
		Pack, the Asheron’s Call Player Luncheon, and lots of chances to talk to 
		the Live Team. All that plus info on Asheron’s Call 2 and Turbine’s 
		upcoming titles: Middle-Earth Online and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online! Join 
		us in Providence, RI, on Saturday, August 7th!</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now let’s take a look at some of the 
		things that are...</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are items that we plan to 
		implement in the July event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior 
		articles.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Improved War Magic Critical Hits</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In July, War Magic critical hits in 
		Player-vs.-Monster (PvM) combat will be improved. The three changes 
		listed below will affect <i>only</i> War Magic spells landed in combat 
		on monsters and War Magic spells cast by monsters on players. War Magic 
		critical hits for Player-vs.-Player (PvP) combat will not change.</font></p>
		<ul type="disc">
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Currently when a War Magic spell 
			scores a critical hit, it adds a multiple of the base damage of the 
			spell to a normal damage roll. Starting in July, War Magic critical 
			hits will instead add a multiple of the <i>maximum</i> damage of the 
			spell. No more crits that do less damage than non-crits!<br>
			<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Critical Strike for War Magic 
			currently scales from 5% critical hit chance to 25% critical hit 
			chance at maximum effectiveness. In July, the maximum effectiveness 
			will be increased to 50% chance.<br>
			<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
			<li><font size="2" face="Arial">Crippling Blow for War Magic 
			currently scales from adding 50% of the spells damage on critical 
			hits to adding 100% at maximum effectiveness. In July, the maximum 
			effectiveness will be increased to adding up to 500% of the spell’s 
			damage.</font></li>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, the three changes listed below 
		will affect <i>only</i> War Magic spells landed in combat on monsters 
		and War Magic spells cast by monsters on players. War Magic critical 
		hits for Player-vs.-Player (PvP) combat will not change.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is one additional change that will 
		affect both PvP and PvM combat. All imbues and slayer bonuses scale 
		their effectiveness based on the skill level of the player. Currently, 
		imbues and slayer bonuses, when used with War Magic, scale from minimum 
		effectiveness at 150 base War Magic skill to maximum effectiveness at 
		400 base War Magic skill. Starting in July, imbue and slayer effects for 
		War Magic will scale will scale from minimum effectiveness at 125 to 
		maximum effectiveness at 360.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These changes are intended to improve War 
		Magic damage over time in PvM combat, in to increase the effectiveness 
		of imbues for War Magic. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Aegis Effect for Loot Missile Weapons</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In July, Bow, Crossbow and Atlatl users 
		will be able to gain the ability to add a Magic-Absorbing property to 
		any loot missile weapon. This property will work in exactly the same way 
		as an Aegis shield, but has the side-effect of a 10% melee defense 
		penalty. You will be able to grant this property to an item that has 
		been imbued and/or tinkered, but you can’t add an imbue after having 
		added this property. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It’s important to note that this is not 
		expected to be the be-all, end-all balancing item for PvP missile 
		weapons. We still have additional goals, as we’ve mentioned in previous 
		articles. This new property is intended to give missile weapon users 
		additional options in both PvP and PvM combat, in situations where 
		incoming war spells are a greater threat than melee attacks. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Content Update: Lin</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are continuing with our ongoing 
		process of updating the towns of Dereth and their surrounding content. 
		In July, Lin and its nearby content will be revised to better suit its 
		role as a base for characters in the 20-40 range. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Content Update: Singularity Weapons</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We’re also continuing our ongoing process 
		of updating older quests. In July, the Singularity Weapons are being 
		revised. The existing two tiers of weapons are being restated for 
		characters in their 40’s and 70’s, and a new third tier is being added 
		for characters in their 50’s. </font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">In Development</font></b></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we 
		are working on for the August event. None of these items are guaranteed 
		to be added for August, as scheduling and priorities can change. Your 
		feedback on these topics is particularly valuable.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Crafting Quests</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Due to scheduling conflicts, the addition 
		of new crafting quests has been pushed back until August. These quests 
		may be similar to those introduced in the June event, but would be 
		designed for higher-level characters.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Content Update: Aerlinthe</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We would like to update Aerlinthe in a 
		manner similar to the recent Marae Lassel update. Landscape hunting on 
		Aerlinthe will likely be revamped to better suit mid to high level 
		characters. The Lady Aerfalle quest may have minor cosmetic changes, 
		such as tweaks to the creatures in the various dungeons associated with 
		the quest, but we do not expect to make any major revisions to the quest 
		mechanics.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">In Concept</font></b></div>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">(These are the game changes that we 
		are thinking about for September and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – 
		or even <b>if</b> – any of these changes will be added to the game, as 
		scheduling and priorities can change. Your feedback on these topics is 
		particularly valuable.</font></i></p>
		<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">If not mentioned elsewhere in this 
		Letter, topics listed as <b>In Concept</b> in prior articles have not 
		changed status.)</font></i></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">War Magic Improvements</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Along with the critical hit improvements 
		that we’re adding in July, we are looking at increasing War Magic damage 
		on Bolts, Arcs, and Streaks at spell levels 1 through 6. The goal is to 
		improve War Magic damage over time at lower levels, where it currently 
		lags behind other combat skills in comparison to its skill credit cost. 
		Level 7 Streaks may also have their damage increased, although this is 
		still being researched. We want to ensure that any improvements we make 
		benefit War Mages in PvM combat without unbalancing War Magic in PvP 
		play.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineSmall">
			<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Content Update: Three Crystals Quest</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the June Letter to the Players, 
		priorities and schedules changed and this content revision has been 
		pushed out past August. We plan to revise the Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and 
		Shendolain Crystal quests and quest rewards to make them more 
		appropriate for their various level ranges.</font></p>
		<div class="headlineMedium">
			<b><font face="Arial">Conclusion</font></b></div>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Those are our plans for July and beyond. 
		Please note that topics that have been previously mentioned in the <b>In 
		Development</b> and <b>In Concept</b> sections of prior articles are 
		still being developed or considered, unless mentioned otherwise. As I 
		mentioned at the beginning of this letter, you may see fewer In Concept 
		articles making it into Development in the near future as we focus more 
		resources on the billing migration.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As always, we value your feedback on this 
		letter. See you in Dereth!</font></p>
