&nbsp;<div>
            <font face="Arial">Hey folks! Today I’d like to talk some more about 
            our plans for Preview. Right now we are on track to launch Open 
            Preview in about two weeks. The Preview world, which we’re calling 
            “Destiny”, is up and running with a recent build of the game. We’re 
            working on getting the necessary web pages ready to provide all the 
            instructions for connecting to Preview as well as getting the 
            Preview keys and installer to our download partner.<br>
            <br>
            As we said earlier, we know that most of our existing players aren’t 
            going to want to level up in the usual fashion on Destiny – you’re 
            going to want to jump right in to some of the new high-level 
            content. To that end we’ve created Turbine Vendors and the Turbine 
            Emissary, who will be hand-placed over the course of Preview in the 
            new town of Sanamar. The Turbine Vendors will sell some pretty nice 
            equipment at very reasonable prices. Right now they’re set up to 
            sell all level 7 spells, all four Foci, full sets of Olthoi Armor 
            (all four level breaks), Good and Perfect Isparian Arms, Fallen 
            weapons, all spell components, and Level Tokens.<br>
            <br>
            Level Tokens are the quick advancement we’d mentioned earlier. Buy a 
            level 40 token, hand it to the nearby Emissary, and you’ll be given 
            the amount of experience to go from level 5 (fresh out of the 
            Training Academy) to 40. Then you’ll be given an MMD note to help 
            you get equipped.<br>
            <br>
            We have Level Tokens all the way up to 260, but we’re not planning 
            on having all of them available at the very beginning of Open 
            Preview. Then you would all level to 260 and you would miss all the 
            great content in between! We’ll be placing new Turbine Vendors on 
            landscape with the higher-level Tokens over the course of Preview at 
            pre-announced times. <br>
            <br>
            One other note regarding Preview – in addition to Open Preview, we 
            will be conducting a very limited Closed Preview between this week 
            and the launch of Open Preview. Closed Preview is limited to a very 
            small group of pre-selected testers as well as some media contacts, 
            so please don’t email me asking how to get in. I just wanted to be 
            upfront with y’all about it before any crazy rumors got started.<br>
            <br>
            On the development front we’re still making excellent progress and 
            we’re still on track for the July 18 launch. This week we expect to 
            have final signoff on our retail CD which will be then shipped to 
            our distribution partners at Station Publishing and Codemasters. We 
            do expect there to be a small launch-day patch to resolve a small 
            group of bugs we still have in the queue along with any issues that 
            arise during Preview.<br>
            <br>
            A reminder regarding the AC:TD launch: <b>All players</b> will need 
            to have the new client and new data files in order to play once we 
            launch on July 18, whether or not they subscribe to Throne of 
            Destiny. There will be three ways to get the new client and data 
            files:<br>
            <br>
            • Buy Throne of Destiny and install from the CD. (Obviously, this is 
            the method we recommend.)<br>
            <br>
            • Download the Open Preview. If you have the Open Preview installed 
            on your computer and run the Preview Launcher after the servers come 
            up on the 18th, it will automatically patch to the Throne of Destiny 
            launcher. <br>
            <br>
            • Download the new client. We’ll be publishing a link to the 
            installer before July 18, so that you can download it at your 
            leisure ahead of time and be ready for launch.<br>
            <br>
            Doing any of these will allow you to play the game, but only buying 
            the Throne of Destiny retail box will upgrade your account to allow 
            you to experience AC:TD content such as Rares, levels beyond 126, 
            the Halaetan Islands and more. (Including, as was announced in the 
            Mystics Q&amp;A, a seventh character slot!) In addition only buying 
            AC:TD will let you use the very high resolution textures that we’ll 
            be unlocking in an event after launch.<br>
            <br>
            We’re also continuing our work on the August Event. We’ve been 
            having meetings to go over proposed content additions as well as to 
            set the schedule with QA and NetOps. Obviously one of our top 
            priorities is going to be resolving any issues that come up after 
            the AC:TD launch that may have been missed during the Open Preview.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many of you asked if we were going to be addressing any major game 
            systems or mechanics in the August event – there will be more on 
            this in the August Letter to the Players but at this point we’re not 
            planning any major changes. As I said, we’re leaving development and 
            bugfixing time available in order to take on any issues that arise 
            after the AC:TD launch.<br>
            <br>
            One last note on the topic of the Live Game: As I mentioned last 
            week, we have been investigating the source of server-side lag on 
            Darktide. On Tuesday we took the step of shutting down the Mausoleum 
            dungeons, and since that time we have not seen the performance 
            spikes that had accompanied the lag reports. It’s still too early to 
            tell whether the issue has truly been resolved, but it is promising. 
            More discussion of this topic is being done on our PvP Discussions 
            forum.<br>
            <br>
            So, that’s the news on Throne of Destiny development, Open Preview, 
            and the next Event. Very exciting times up ahead!<br>
