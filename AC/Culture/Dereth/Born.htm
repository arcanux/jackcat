	(August 6, 2004)</span></font></small></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Passers-by were not being very kind to the 
	Mosswart who huddled near the branches of a fern, sitting on a stone to rest 
	his legs. He had arrived the previous night with a small slip of parchment 
	bearing Elysa’s seal. A member of the Royal Guard had escorted him into Bai 
	Yao Feng’s tent; when the little creature assured Bai Yao in broken Roulean 
	that he was there at the behest of the High Queen, the guard nodded her 
	confirmation.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It didn’t sit well with the barkeep or his 
	patrons. Their town had been displaced two years ago – homes were lost, 
	along with years of life and love, all because of a ravening madman that had 
	wanted to take the world for himself. Arwic had been rebuilt, but Yanshi? It 
	appeared that Yanshi was too small a town to merit the Council’s attention. 
	Now they were saddled with a creature whose race had, until recently, 
	plagued the nearby swamps. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It sat most uneasily with Bai Yao, but he had 
	accepted the Royal Guardswoman’s word as proof and told the Mosswart that it 
	could find a place to nestle somewhere in the town. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After it left, the Guardswoman – Ydnew – had 
	stayed to talk to Bai Yao. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What’s this about?” Bai Yao asked as he 
	offered forth a frothy mug of ale.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“A treaty,” Ydnew answered quietly. She took 
	the mug into her left hand, placing her hat on her knee. “The High Queen met 
	with this little fellow the other evening and he pleaded a rather emotional 
	case. The Burun have been slaughtering them wherever they go... they’re 
	dying off it seems.”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Dying off?” Bai Yao asked incredulously.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Apparently,” Yndew replied, sipping from her 
	mug. “The swamps are changing... or so that little Mosswart says. The land 
	is getting spoiled and the Mosswarts are getting sick and dying. Many of 
	them were slaughtered when the first of those temples was found. They had 
	thought it was the Banderlings, that they had come to make war, but now they 
	believe it was ‘ill spirits’.” Ydnew leaned back in the chair a bit. “I’m 
	here to watch over the little fellow and make sure that no harm befalls him. 
	I’ll also be conducting a little research on behalf of the High Queen. From 
	what I have been hearing, things are a lot worse than they appear.”</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At that, Ydnew had drained the rest of the 
	ale and slapped the mug onto the table.&nbsp; She stood, gave Bai Yao a smile, 
	and went out into the night.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fort loomed in the dark night. Alb’arel 
	and Rez’arel were obscured by thick clouds and provided only intermittent 
	light as lightning flashed through the stormy sky. Torgluuk kicked aside a 
	Sclavus corpse and surveyed the interior of their new home. The fortress was 
	tall, three Guruk high, and covered in a pungent algae. The walls were 
	timeworn and scarred. The Burun had already begun to dig beneath one post of 
	the fortress to provide a lair. Many of them were growing heavy with eggs, 
	and those who were not were growing increasingly uneasy about the news of 
	the Guruk.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Torgluuk had sent Morgluuk into the west to 
	seize control of the dullards before they tore a swath through the world and 
	threatened the tenuous peace that they had found with the Renegades. 
	Torgluuk had stayed behind to ensure that the treaty was upheld by their new 
	allies. He was disappointed to learn that his fears about the Renegades were 
	well-founded. It was a situation that he would need to remedy – quickly.

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Lady strode through the halls of her keep 
	with a smile on her ageless face for the first time in countless years. Her 
	flesh was pale, but it had the blush of youth and her hair bounced in the 
	wind. The world was changing; the Lightbringer was gone and there was little 
	she had to fear from the Outlanders. As she led her entourage back into the 
	bowels of her keep, she let her mind lapse for one brief moment. That moment 
	was long enough to allow a host of souls, bound for eternity, to slip her 
	grasp and take residence across the surface of the island.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nearly all had lost their minds, save one.&nbsp; 
	That one waited for a shining moment of bliss. She would never be free, but 
	she would have her revenge. The Lady would feel the pain of the death and 
	the long years of torment. She would feel all of it.</font></p>

	been described in detail in the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=259">
	Letter to the Players</a>. Here are some additional topics that we’d like to 
	discuss in detail.</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Loadfiles</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There is a new command available to players 
	this month: <i>@loadfile [filename]</i>. This command will load the listed 
	filename and execute each line as if you had entered it manually into the 
	chat bar. The file needs to be in flat text format.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Please note that for the purposes of the 
	in-game spam filter each line is executed exactly as if you had entered it 
	manually. For example, this means that if you create a file with 1000 lines 
	of the word “Hi!” and load it with <i>@loadfile</i>, you will find yourself 
	gagged by the spam filter.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Clothing Bug</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For some time there has been a rare bug that 
	could cause a character to be unable to wear clothing or armor on one body 
	location. For example, players had reported being unable to wear a helmet, 
	or being unable to put on pants. In the past when this occurred, a Developer 
	would need to go in-game and correct the issue through careful use of 
	complicated diagnostics commands. Starting this month, a player who 
	experiences this bug should be able to resolve it simply by logging out and 
	logging back in to the game.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Dungeon Textures</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the new dungeons introduced this month 
	uses wall textures that will not appear in Software Rendering mode. This 
	means that if you do not have 3D Acceleration enabled, the walls of this 
	dungeon will appear white and featureless.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you aren’t sure if you have 3D 
	Acceleration enabled, go into your Asheron’s Call folder (typically 
	C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesAsheron’s Call) and run ACD3DSetup. </font>
	</p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">In-Development Topics</font></b></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the publication of the August Letter to 
	the Players, we’ve made two changes to our goals for the September event.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, the Crafting Quests that we had 
	planned on introducing in September have been rescheduled for a later month.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Secondly, we had originally announced that we 
	would be revising the content surrounding the town of Khayyaban for 
	September. We have decided instead to revise the content near Al-Jalima.</font></p>

    (July 27, 2004)</span></font></small><p><font size="2" face="arial">Welcome to the August 
    Letter to the Players! </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Last month in Dereth, a third Falatacot temple was 
    discovered. A new portal was opened – whether intentionally or accidentally 
    – allowing a previously unseen species of Burun to come through. It seems 
    likely that these hulking Guruk will add a new level of threat to the 
    Burun/Renegade alliance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Meanwhile, on the Vesayen Islands new evidence was 
    discovered linking the Moarsmen to the Burun and to the meddling of the 
    Falatacot priestesses.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Will the legacy of these ancient cultists prove to be the 
    undoing of Isparian society on Dereth?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Before we look at the changes coming in the August event, 
    I’d like to provide some information on the recent Frostfell, Leafcull, 
    Solclaim, and Thistledown extended downtime. </font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Recent Server Issues</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Early Monday morning, the database cluster that supports 
    these four worlds suffered a hardware failure. Operations was able to 
    recover data from 7AM EDT Monday and start all four worlds back up early 
    Monday evening. The only reported data loss were the items stored in one 
    housing community on Solclaim.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">However, late Monday night the database cluster suffered 
    another failure. Multiple players were unable to login and received error 
    messages. It was necessary to bring all four worlds back down and begin an 
    emergency migration of these four worlds to new hardware.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Unfortunately the old hardware was too unstable to allow 
    us to successfully complete this migration. We made the difficult decision 
    to roll back all four worlds to the last good backup: 7AM EDT Sunday, July 
    25. This would allow us to restore from the backup tapes directly, bypassing 
    the old hardware altogether.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Operations completed this task much more quickly than 
    expected and began bringing the four worlds up at 4:00PM EDT on Tuesday. As 
    of Tuesday evening the worlds appear to be stable. There have been reports 
    of houses becoming available due to the expiration of the timer on 
    maintenance, but there appear to be no further major issues.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">While we can’t directly replace any experience or items 
    lost due to these hardware issues, we can provide the following as a form of 
    reimbursement: During the September event, characters on the four affected 
    worlds will have the option of receiving one free level’s worth of 
    experience from a Town Crier. Please watch for the September Letter to the 
    Players for more details.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Please accept our apologies for this unplanned downtime.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Now let’s take a look at what’s coming in the next monthly 
    event.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineMedium" style="width: 437; height: 16">
      <b>Coming Soon</b></div>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="arial">(These are items that we plan to implement in the 
    August event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior articles.)</font></i></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Crafting Quests</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As we’ve said in previous articles, we will be adding 
    additional quests for crafting characters to use in gaining experience and 
    other rewards. Several of these quests will be added in this month’s event.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">One change that we want to warn you about ahead of time is 
    that the Ash Gromnie Tooth rewards from the Glenden Woods crafting quests 
    are being reduced. They are currently worth 25% of the experience needed to 
    get 1 point in the appropriate craft skill; this is being reduced to 10%, 
    and the difficulty of the craft skill interaction is being reduced from 250 
    to 200. However we’re adding new craft interactions with rewards equal to – 
    and greater than – the Ash Tooth rewards.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Iasparailaun</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">When we revised the Gaerlan Quest in June, we changed the 
    Gaerlan sword turn in to better reward players at level 126. Unfortunately, 
    the experience reward at 126 was being shared among fellowship members.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We had always intended that players could complete the 
    quest with one character and then have a different character receive the 
    reward. This is why the sword is giveable, and why you don’t need to have 
    completed the quest to receive the experience reward. However the ability to 
    fellow with a 126 and receive half of that flat reward was not intended.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">After some discussion, we have decided to change this 
    experience reward so that it is not shared among fellows – the character who 
    turns in the sword will receive the entire reward.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Biting Strike and Crushing Blow and War Magic in PK and 
      PKL</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">In last month’s revision of the Singularity Weapons quest, 
    we added Biting Strike and Crushing Blow to the Singularity Scepters. 
    However on the Ultimate Singularity Scepter, these modifiers were higher 
    than the maximum effectiveness of the Critical Strike and Crippling Blow 
    imbues in PK and PKL (player-vs.-player or PvP) combat. With these 
    modifiers, the Singularity Scepter was arguably better than the Weeping 
    Wand, which was never our intent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We needed to find a way to keep these items from being 
    unbalancing in PvP combat, but we wanted to do this without nerfing them in 
    player-vs.-monster (PvM) combat. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">To that end, we have changed the way that Biting Strike 
    and Crushing Blow work on casters in PvP combat. They are still fixed 
    bonuses, but the amount of the bonus will be based on the maximum 
    effectiveness of the comparable imbues. For example, a weapon with Biting 
    Strike, in PvP, will never be more effective than the maximum effectiveness 
    of a loot weapon imbued with Critical Strike. The same is true for Crushing 
    Blow and Crippling Blow. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Again, this is true <i>only</i> in PvP, and it <i>only</i> 
    applies to casting items. </font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Content Revision: Aerlinthe</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">
    <img src="Born/148.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="211" height="253">As part 
    of our ongoing goals of revising existing content to better fit today’s 
    game, for August we have revised Aerlinthe Island and the Aerfalle quest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As you can see to the right, Aerlinthe is now designed for 
    characters from level 40 to level 80, with specific areas for 80+ 
    characters. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Aerfalle quest is intended for characters from levels 
    40-60, but we’ve made some changes that will make it worthwhile for 
    characters above that level as well. We’ve also streamlined the quest to 
    remove some of the delays. For example, the respawn timer on the Repair 
    Golem has been cut nearly in half.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">One important change to the Aerfalle quest is that the 
    Ashen Key is being changed from giveable and always-drop-on-death to Bonded 
    and Attuned. If you have Ashen Keys on a mule, we strongly recommend that 
    you move these Keys to a character capable of completing the quest and do so 
    prior to the August event.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">You’ll also see some brand-new monsters on Aerlinthe, and 
    we believe that we’ve kept the unique feel that the island has always had.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Content Revision: Mattekar Robes</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">In August, the Mattekar Robes will receive an update. All 
    new and existing Canescent Mattekar Robes, Hoary Mattekar Robes, Swarthy 
    Mattekar Robes, and Robes of the Tundra will be improved in some way. The 
    sole exceptions are older Robes of the Tundra, those that do not have spells 
    on them. In general, Armor Levels are being increased across the board. Plus 
    there'll be a bit of a surprise!</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Phyntos Wasps</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">In addition to the new monsters found on Aerlinthe, we’ve 
    improved the appearance of all Phyntos Wasps. So the next time your 
    mid-level characters are running, screaming, from a White Phyntos Wasp, be 
    sure to turn around and admire their new look!</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Biakas and the Caul</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Recently we have seen a lot of player activity at the 
    center of the Singularity Caul, where the high-level Biakas spawn. In 
    addition to the player activity, there've been a number of posts on the 
    various community forums – and calls to the Envoy teams. Everyone wants to 
    camp these spawns! When we took a closer look, we saw why – these creatures 
    were giving out much too much experience when they were killed. No wonder 
    this was one of the most fought-over hunting grounds in Dereth!</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Unfortunately, once we observed this, we realized that it 
    would be necessary to decrease the experience granted by these creatures. 
    Starting in August, the Hellion, Biaka, Graal Margul and Helcan Margul are 
    having their experience decreased by 37.5%, 33%, 40% and 53% respectively. 
    This will bring these creatures back into balance and resolve the 
    overcrowding issues at the center of the Singularity Caul. It was never our 
    intent for hunting in this area to be so much more profitable than hunting 
    in other areas on the island.</p>
    <div class="headlineMedium">
      <b>In Development</b></div>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="arial">(These are the game changes that we are working on for 
    the September event. None of these items are guaranteed to be added for 
    September, as scheduling and priorities can change. Your feedback on these 
    topics is particularly valuable.)</font></i></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Crafting Quests</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">In addition to the new quests we’re adding for August, we 
    plan to add several more crafting quests in September.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">Content Revisions</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">In September we expect to revise the Three Crystal Quests. 
    As we’ve done with other content revisions, the quests and their rewards 
    will be revised and rebalanced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">In addition, the content surrounding the town of Khayyaban 
    will be revised in much the same way as was recently done with the town of 
    Lin.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">War Magic Improvements</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Along with the critical hit improvements that we added in 
    July, we are looking at increasing War Magic damage on Bolts, Arcs, and 
    Streaks at spell levels 1 through 6. The goal is to improve War Magic damage 
    over time at lower levels, where it currently lags behind other combat 
    skills in comparison to its skill credit cost. Level 7 Streaks may also have 
    their damage increased, although this is still being researched. We want to 
    ensure that any improvements we make benefit War Mages in PvM combat without 
    unbalancing War Magic in PvP play.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineSmall">
      <b><font size="2" face="arial">PvP Missile Speed Increase</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the 
    effectiveness of Bow, Crossbow, and Atlatl in PvP combat, we are 
    investigating increasing the attack speed on these three weapons in the 
    three PvP weapon suites: Hollow, Phantom, and Weeping. We continue working 
    on other means of improving the effectiveness of missile weapons in PvP, we 
    feel that this will help considerably.</font></p>
    <div class="headlineMedium">
      <b>In Concept</b></div>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="arial">(These are the game changes that we are thinking about 
    for October and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or even <b>if</b> – any 
    of these changes will be added to the game, as scheduling and priorities can 
    change. Your feedback on these topics is particularly valuable.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="arial">If not mentioned elsewhere in this Letter, topics 
    listed as <b>In Concept</b> in prior articles have not changed status.)</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">There aren’t any new In Concept topics this month. We’re 
    continuing to work on and research the topics listed in previous articles, 
    with the goal of moving them to In Development soon!</font></p>
