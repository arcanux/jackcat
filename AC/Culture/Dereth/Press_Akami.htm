    Release of Online Games</font></span></b><p><font size="2" face="arial">Turbine's Online 
    Games, Game Updates, Video Trailers, Free Trials and Patches Will Be 
    Delivered Via Akamai Media Delivery</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="arial">GAME DEVELOPER'S CONFERENCE - SAN FRANCISCO - March 9, 
    2005 -</font></b><font size="2" face="arial"> Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), 
    the leading global service provider for accelerating content and business 
    processes online, today announced that Turbine, Inc., a leading producer and 
    publisher of online subscription entertainment, has chosen Akamai Media 
    Delivery for secure, reliable delivery of its online assets. Akamai Media 
    Delivery is ideal for delivering Turbine's games, patches, content updates 
    and online promotional streaming trailers, and is also the solution of 
    choice for 25 of the top 30 media and entertainment businesses*. <br>
    <br>
    Turbine, which develops, operates and publishes online games, needed a 
    solution to meet the growing needs of its customers. Every day, Turbine 
    customers download and play online video games, download free trials and 
    video trailers, and get new game updates and patches. Given that many of 
    these games and video trailers are very large, graphically intensive files, 
    they can typically take a long time to download, with frequent failures. 
    Turbine is addressing these issues by trusting Akamai to deliver its 
    complete set of electronic downloads. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;We saw an opportunity for a respected online entertainment company like 
    Turbine, and Akamai, a leader in the media delivery space, to partner to 
    drive the online game market together,&quot; said Mike Hogan, vice president of 
    technology and operations, Turbine, Inc. &quot;Akamai is a quality service 
    provider - and it's critical that our content is delivered over a quality 
    distribution platform that helps us reach a global audience.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;By leveraging the Akamai platform, Turbine can offer its customers a great 
    experience through fast, reliable delivery of the content they need,&quot; said 
    Kris Alexander, senior media and entertainment solution manager, Akamai. 
    &quot;Providing a great online experience is important for ensuring customer 
    satisfaction and growing a customer base. Akamai helps ensure this with a 
    proven platform designed to enable storage and global delivery of games and 
    other media assets online.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The demand for media of all types — music, movies, games and more is growing 
    rapidly. Fickle consumers want to access media how they want, when they want 
    and where they want. To be successful, businesses need to be on par or 
    better than traditional delivery options. Akamai Media Delivery offers 
    businesses a scalable and reliable platform to enable the delivery, 
    protection and monetization of a range of digital media assets, including 
    music, movies, games, broadcasts, TV shows, and events — without adding or 
    needing to maintain infrastructure. <br>
