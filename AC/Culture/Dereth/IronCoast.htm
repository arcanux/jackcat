    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Duke Langdon sent the call to his followers, 
    requesting they all come to his mansion immediately to hear news of the 
    latest discoveries in Dereth. The covenant crystal hummed with the arrival 
    of each follower, and soon the Duke's audience chamber was filled to 
    overflowing with people all struggling to hear this news.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Seated in his throne at the front of the 
    chamber, the Duke addressed his messenger. &quot;You mean to tell me that there 
    is yet <em>another</em> island off the coast of Dereth?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, Your Grace,&quot; responded his liegeman 
    diffidently.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What is that, the fifth island discovered?&quot; 
    Langdon grumbled. &quot;How many islands are there around this accursed isle?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Well, Your Grace,&quot; a figure standing beside 
    the Duke's throne began. &quot;If you count the individual Vesayen Isles, this 
    would be at least the twelfth such island. Likely there are quite a few 
    more; all the records we've discovered point to Dereth being part of an 
    archipelago.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Thank you, Kinross,&quot; the Duke sighed. He 
    pinched his fingers to rub the bridge of nose. &quot;I appreciate you being 
    studious in your duties as Vizier; however, the question was merely 
    rhetorical.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kinross bowed his head. &quot;Yes, Your Grace.&quot;
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Turning his attention back to the messenger 
    who remained kneeling before him, the Duke asked, &quot;And the name of this new 
    island?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Actually it consists of two islands, Your 
    Grace, so these would be the thirteenth and fourteenth islands discovered-&quot;
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, thank you!&quot; the Duke cut in abruptly. 
    &quot;The number of the islands is not important at the moment. What is the name 
    of this new island?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Aphus Lassel, Your Grace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Another Empyrean name,&quot; the Duke sighed. 
    &quot;How did you come to find this island?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I was exploring the northern wilds of Osteth 
    when I came across a pack of Tuskers. Standing in the center of this group 
    was a shrine of some sort. The Tuskers seemed unusually interested in 
    defending it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I see, and what did this shrine look like?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A Tusker, Your Grace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Interesting,&quot; the Duke said. He turned to 
    address his Vizier. &quot;Kinross, do you think the Tuskers have developed some 
    sort of totemic belief system? Perhaps due to the Virindi influence?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Duke blinked. &quot;'No?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No… Your Grace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Duke Langdon sighed and turned back to his 
    liegeman. &quot;Please continue your tale. You found a shrine, you said?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, Your Grace. After defeating the Tuskers 
    surrounding it, I approached the shrine and suddenly found myself tumbling 
    through portalspace. Once the haze of portal magic faded, I was standing on 
    the island. Well, one of the two islands that-&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; the Duke said, beckoning the man 
    to continue with an impatient wave of his hand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Well, Your Grace, I found myself in what 
    could best be called a village, although it was unlike any village I had 
    ever seen. The buildings all stood on stilts, and as I climbed up to the 
    platforms, I found Isparians living in the buildings.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;People you say? What did you learn from the 
    townsfolk?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nothing, Your Grace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nothing? Were they unwilling to talk?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No, Your Grace, they seemed unable to talk. 
    The only sounds I ever heard from them were a few grunts. They were almost 
    totally unresponsive, except when it came to the Tuskers around them. They 
    seemed unusually dedicated to their Tusker masters.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Interesting.&quot; The Duke rubbed his chin. &quot;An 
    island where Tuskers rule over men?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Your Grace, it is not unheard of for we 
    Isparians to be dominated by another species,&quot; Kinross interrupted. &quot;You, of 
    course, recall the dark years when the Olthoi enslaved us, forcing us to 
    prepare that disgusting gruel they fed to their grubs.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Thank you for that history lesson, Kinross,&quot; 
    the Duke said sharply. &quot;Although, again, it was simply a rhetorical 
    question.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Muttering under his breath, the Duke turned 
    his attention back to the man kneeling before the dais. &quot;What other 
    information do you have to offer us?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Well Your Grace, it appears the Tuskers have 
    a king of sorts,&quot; the man replied. &quot;Surprisingly, some of the Tuskers' 
    grunts were almost understandable. The ones I defeated would occasionally 
    speak of their king as they fell.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;A king? Amazing!&quot; the Duke exclaimed. &quot;Kinross, 
    what do you make of this discovery?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Nothing,&quot; Kinross said then quickly added 
    &quot;Your Grace.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Duke muttered more noticeably this time, 
    but then turned back to his follower and said, &quot;Does this king have a name, 
    or do you know how he can be found?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The man shifted uncomfortably. &quot;Well, Your 
    Grace, I might have heard his name.&quot; He paused.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;And his name is…&quot; the Duke prompted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Well, I'm not sure I understood them 
    correctly, Your Grace. The Tuskers' grunts were difficult to understand.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;That's fine, just tell us what you think you 
    heard.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;As I said though, Your Grace, the Tuskers' 
    grunts were barely what I would call speech-&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Just tell us the name!&quot; the Duke bellowed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Bobo,&quot; the man said quietly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Duke blinked for a moment, opening and 
    closing his mouth as he searched for something to say. Finally he blurted, &quot;Bobo?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes, Your Grace. Bobo.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Duke sat silent for a moment longer, then 
    suddenly stood up and spoke in a loud, authoritative voice, &quot;This audience 
    is at an end.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he stalked out of the room, the Duke 
    muttered loudly under his breath, gesturing angrily in response to the 
    discussion he was carrying out with himself. Once he was gone, the audience 
    chamber exploded in conversation, each person wondering what to make of this 
    island of Aphus Lassel and its mysterious king.</font></p>

      2002</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth reveals her secrets slowly, yet each 
      day yields new discoveries. Occasionally the discovery may be just a few 
      ruins uncovered by desert winds, at other times something larger, such as 
      previously unknown lands. At the dawn of the month of Leafcull, bruised 
      and battered explorers returned to tell of a newly discovered island 
      called Aphus Lassel and ruled by Tuskers. Any foolish enough to attempt 
      the exploration of this new land, these adventurers warned, would have to 
      find and kneel before a Tusker shrine to gain passage to the island.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aphus Lassel was not the only discovery. The 
    Archmage Celdiseth told of a soul who stumbled into his cottage, a beatific 
    smile gracing her face. He said that after mumbling a few words about 
    finally being able to set things right, she collapsed. After hearing this 
    report, explorers have set off to the northwest of Celdiseth's cabin, 
    following the trail the woman left behind her. Others, hunting in the wilds 
    of the lands, told of valuable treasure being found in guarded camps 
    throughout Dereth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New dangers and new rewards await the people 
    of Dereth, if they are brave enough to face them…</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Miscellaneous Improvements and 
    Changes</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The treasure found on monsters will now 
      decay when the monster's corpse decays. However, monster corpses will now 
      last 5 minutes to offset this, instead of the 90 seconds they previously 
      lasted. Players or fellowships sharing looting rights still have exclusive 
      rights to a monster's corpse for 30 seconds; after that, any player may 
      loot the corpse. The handling of player corpses and items dropped on the 
      ground by players has not changed. These still decay at the same rate they 
      have in the past. Please see November's Letter to the Players for more 
      details.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The chance for causing a critical hit with 
      magic, both with and without a Critical Strike wand, has been increased.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of creatures have been modified 
      slightly in terms of level, power, and experience. In general, these 
      changes have made the creatures worthier opponents with correspondingly 
      better rewards.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can no longer be recruited into a 
      fellowship on the sly. Whenever someone invites you to join a fellowship, 
      you will now receive a confirmation dialog asking you if you'd like to 
      join the fellowship. This confirmation works just like the confirmation 
      dialog on swearing allegiance.</font></p>

      items:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters that completed the Aun Ralirea 
      quest but did not receive the skill point reward will finally receive the 
      skill points they deserved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You must now be reasonably close to a 
      chessboard before you can successfully join a game.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A player's chess ranking can now never 
      change more than 50 points per game.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many exploits that would allow players to 
      interrupt a chess game have been fixed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the past, creatures did not react to 
      magic damage in the same way they reacted to melee or missile damage, 
      which led to unfortunate issues with players not receiving the quest flags 
      necessary for certain quest rewards. This has been addressed, and 
      creatures are now responding to all forms of damage in the same way and 
      are flagging accordingly.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello to all. This letter contains 
      information about some upcoming changes, both in the November update and 
      in future updates. These are important changes, so please read this entire 
      letter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Skill Sell-back</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As previously announced, we are introducing a 
    method by which players can &quot;sell-back&quot; or untrain skills, as well as a 
    method to specialize skills after creation.&nbsp; We had two main goals for this 
    change: first, to allow characters to change decisions that they may have 
    made before they understood the full consequences of those decisions; and 
    second, to allow characters to deal more flexibly with the changing world of 
    Dereth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to sell-back or specialize a skill 
    post-creation, characters will need to complete a quest. I won't go into the 
    details of the quest, but here is the important information you should know 
    about how this system will work:</font></p>
    <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px">
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each step of a skill change--that is, 
      increasing a skill from trained to specialized, decreasing a skill from 
      specialized or trained, or decreasing a skill from trained to 
      untrained--requires the completion of this quest. You can still increase a 
      skill from untrained to trained the old-fashioned way by pressing the 
      green triangle; this does not require a quest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This quest is restricted to characters 
      level 25 and higher. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will not be limited in the total number 
      of times you can do this quest, but you can only complete the quest once 
      every three weeks. This is a change from our original concept, but we felt 
      that being able to complete the quest twice during each monthly event was 
      too liberal. We may decrease this wait time in the future.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will be able to untrain the free skills 
      (Run, Jump, Loyalty, and Magic Defense), but you will not be refunded the 
      skill credits for those skills nor will the skills actually become 
      untrained. You <strong>will</strong> be refunded all the experience you 
      invested into those skills, however.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will be able to untrain your racial 
      skills, but you will not be refunded the skill credits for those skills 
      nor will the skills actually become untrained. You <strong>will</strong> 
      be refunded all the experience you invested into those skills, however.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will not be able to specialize in any 
      of the Tinkering skills.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will not be able to spend more than 50 
      credits in specialized skills. These 50 credits include both the credits 
      invested to train and to specialize the skill.&nbsp; This limits players to the 
      same sets of skills that are possible at character creation.&nbsp; We may lift 
      this restriction in the future.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will not be able to alter a skill in 
      such a way as to cause you to no longer meet a wield requirement for some 
      item that you are currently wielding. You will be asked to remove that 
      item, and then you can attempt to alter your skill again. (Note that you 
      don't have to do the quest again, however.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>For new characters: Any skill 
      points unused in creation will now carry over with you when you first 
      enter the world, instead of being lost forever as they were previously.</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Treasure and Corpse Changes</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In our ongoing effort to improve the 
    performance of our servers, we are making several changes to the treasure 
    system, in particular as it operates with monster corpses.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Currently when a monster dies, its corpse 
    lies there for 90 seconds and then decays, leaving behind any loot that 
    hasn't yet been claimed. This loot remains on the ground until it is either 
    picked up by a player, or cleaned up by the housekeeping system. 
    Unfortunately, as long as the loot sits on the ground it eats server 
    resources, resources related to keeping track of each item and telling all 
    the players in the area about it. In addition, a large number of items on 
    the ground contribute to client lag, both by increasing the amount of 
    messaging between server and client, and by straining the graphics 
    capabilities of the client.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So in order to reduce these performance hits, 
    we are changing the behavior of monster corpses slightly. In November, 
    monster corpses will remain on the ground for five minutes--a much longer 
    period than they currently do--but when they decay, any unclaimed loot that 
    remains on the corpse will also decay. This will reduce the number of items 
    on the ground and thus reduce the load on the game servers. Note that this 
    change does not affect player corpses in any way. Also note that this does 
    not change the period of time in which a monster corpse is &quot;protected&quot; 
    (i.e., the period of time in which only the monster's killer--or the 
    killer's fellowship, if the killer is sharing kill loot rights--can access 
    it).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the future, we will also be re-evaluating 
    our treasure tables to reduce the amount of absolutely useless junk that 
    creatures drop. This change, however, is not part of the November update.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Life Magic Tweaks</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month, we discussed some possible tweaks 
    to Life Magic to address the continuing difficulties faced by some life 
    mages. Unfortunately, at this time we are satisfied with neither the design 
    nor the gameplay effects of those changes. We want to take more time to 
    study the problem and consider your feedback so that we can make the best 
    decisions we can about what tweaks are necessary. For this reason, there are 
    no changes being made to Life Magic in the November update. We will keep you 
    posted on our progress with these changes in the future. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These are the issues we wanted to communicate 
    to you as soon as possible.&nbsp; Thanks for reading, and if you have any 
    questions, please post them at

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately two issues surfaced in 
      today’s “The Iron Coast” event, and due to the severity of one of these 
      errors, a hot fix was required. Along with this, a database rollback to 
      right before the worlds were brought down for the event was required as 
      well.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The error that required this hot fix appeared 
    in the newly introduced skill sellback quest. When untraining a skill, 
    Asheron’s Call checks if you are wielding any items that have wield 
    requirements for that skill. If you are, the untraining action fails and the 
    skill gem is not destroyed. While this error checking was working, the game 
    was still refunding the skill credits and experience spent on that skill to 
    the character. Since the gem was not destroyed, characters could fail to 
    untrain and receive the skill credit and experience refunds repeatedly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The other issue that was corrected in this 
    hot fix involved the Critical Strike imbuement. Unfortunately the percentage 
    of receiving a critical hit while using this imbuement was changed to the 
    percentage used by projectile spells. As this percentage for projectile 
    spell is noticeably lower than melee and missile attacks, players were 
    noticing a significant reduction in the number of critical hits they were 
    dealing out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We regret that these errors appeared in this 
    month’s event and want to thank you for your patience as we confirmed and 
    resolved these issues.<br>
