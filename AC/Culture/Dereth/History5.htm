      PY 11 / Earth: September 2000</font></b></span>
      <p>
		<img border="0" src="Victory/hist3.JPG.html" width="118" height="75" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">On the dawn of the 8th of Thistledown,
      Isparians awoke to find the world turned upside down. &nbsp;</font><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Overnight, the fearsome Shadow Spires had
      descended upon Tufa and Cragstone. Tufa, bereft of defenders as usual, was
      utterly annihilated by titanic blasts from the Spires. A blackened crater
      filled with deadly ebon mist was soon all that remained of the town. The
      once-tranquil waters of the oasis now thundered into this crater via a
      waterfall.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A small patrol of Shadows was discovered
      among the charred remains of the buildings. While they briefly controlled
      the town, help arrived as news spread, and the enemy was quickly
      suppressed. Among the Shadows was a strange and unsettling creature dubbed
      a “grievver.” This eyeless, delicate looking insect proved swift and
      deadly in combat, attacking with acidic breath and resisting the arcane
      arts. However, it was but the first; numerous other encounters with
      grievvers were reported, and often in the company of Shadows.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cragstone might have shared Tufa's fate,
      but for the timely arrival of a pair of enigmatic heroes. Witnesses
      reported that a skilled archeress and a mage dressed in white repulsed the
      approaching Spires, destroying one in a massive explosion that carved a
      new crater bay into the shoreline of the River Prosper. Seemingly in
      retaliation, the Shadow Spires moved northeast to devastate the prosperous
      town of Arwic, inflicting horrific casualties and disrupting the entire
      region.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the afternoon wore on, more reports came
      in of previously unseen species wandering the landscape. Huge and mighty
      ursuin became the first non-human species to arrive from Ispar. Bizarre
      niffis -- levitating half-squid, half-shellfish creatures -- bobbed gently
      along the shores and desert sands. The scholars of Cragstone, after
      recovering from the terror of the night before, hypothesized that these
      new species arrived through some form of damage done to portalspace by the
      Shadow Spires' blasts. In the past, the actions of these howling
      monstrosities had displayed an alarming tendency to cause new ruptures
      between the planes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the first night fell after the
      catastrophic attacks, a more subtle horror was discovered. The stars and
      moons had disappeared. In their place, strange fires chewed the sky.
      Whether the astronomical bodies had been moved, destroyed, or somehow
      occluded could not be discerned. The shooting stars seen the previous
      month, though, continued to fall. Indeed, their speed and numbers only
      seemed to increase.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the next few days, patrols discovered
      several previously uncharted rings of standing menhir stones, all of which
      hummed with growing power. A nervous watch was kept at these locations,
      and pickets reported frequent contact with both Shadows and the undead.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, portals opened at all the rings,
      allowing access to three large and previously undiscovered dungeons. The
      first, Fenmalain, was littered with the corpses of Shadows and undead.
      Exploratory parties moved cautiously throughout the halls, encountering
      isolated groups of weak Shadows and undead, apparently the survivors of a
      massive battle a few hours before. Large companies of Shadows infested the
      second dungeon, Caulnalain. They appeared to be working at the behest of
      Isin Dule, for they staunchly defended the facility. The last, Shendolain,
      was thick with powerful undead from both the Direlands castle of
      Chalicmere and Aerlinthe island. Casualties at this dungeon were horrific.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the bottom of each facility lay a single
      towering obsidian obelisk. For a brief time, these baffled the weary and
      bloodied adventurers. Then it was realized that the keys to these
      “gates” could likely be recovered from the enemies of humanity. Shadow
      Children indeed surrendered the keys to Fenmalain; Lieutenants, those to
      Caulnalain; and the fearsome grievvers yielded the way into the deeps of
      Shendolain.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the heart of each dungeon lay a terrible
      secret -- each held safe one piece of the Yalaini Mage Council's crystal
      array, in which was bound the dread Hopeslayer, Bael'Zharon. The children
      of Ispar attacked each in turn, and, in turn, each fell. As the crystals
      shattered and toppled, massive waves of energy flowed across the face of
      Dereth. Some claimed to have heard black laughter.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not all the news proved quite so grim:
      Dereth's native verdalim, berimphur, and hennacin plants came into season.
      Alchemists and cooks were soon working round the clock fulfilling requests
      for the green, yellow, and red dyes that could be made from the plants'
      ground and boiled pulp. Many turned a tidy profit at the task, assisted by
      improved trade laws drafted by the sages of Hebian-to. The rare dyeing
      disasters were a sight to pain the eyes, although some, inexplicably,
      appreciated the eye-catching results. These outcasts of fashion were
      politely tolerated in most towns, but a few found themselves ducking under
      hurled mugs and flatware.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the conclusion of Thistledown, the thin
      strand of a single remaining Soul Crystal suspended the fate of the world.
      Bael'Zharon's power waxed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">. . . and in the blackened rubble of Tufa,
      eight shattered stones, all but forgotten in the chaos, sputtered their
      magical powers back into the dead earth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Something began to unravel.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="History6.htm">Continued</a></font></td>
