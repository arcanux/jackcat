      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Why are they doing this?” Jenavere 
      whispered. Below their treetop lookout, the mosswart tribe was scattering 
      in dismay. The attacking undead patrol toppled the mossies' chubby statue 
      with a mighty shove. The emerald sclavus accompanying them hissed 
      fiercely. The tribe, and their ragged human captive, disappeared into the 
      creaking underbrush of the rainforest, hooting angrily. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hendac handed a small piece of parchment to 
    her. <i>Bored? </i>it said. He shrugged, rustling the fronds. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We should have been able to rescue that 
    man,” she hissed. “Where are all these undead coming from?” Since venturing 
    through an uncharted portal yesterday, they had spent most of their time 
    avoiding the undead, sclavus, and unfamiliar beasts infesting the steaming 
    jungle. Below, the undead muttered in their guttural tongue. A whisper of it 
    floated across her mind: “Silly beasts. . . no gods. . . Great Ones. . . 
    reborn.” They wandered off, laughing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Oi! You up there!” Jena blinked, and looked 
    down. Four suspicious-looking men glared up at them, pointing spears. They 
    were clothed in rags and reeds, faces smeared with mud. “Watcher doin' here, 
    eh?” their Aluvian leader asked. “Didjer escape the Olthoi too?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jenavere glanced at Hendac. “The queen is 
    dead, boys,” she called down. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They looked at each other uncertainly. One 
    mouthed: <i>liar</i>. The leader squinted at her in open disbelief. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“. . . And it's cold on this limb,” she 
    continued, unperturbed. “Put those sticks away and let us come down. I have 
    a story to tell you. . .” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Unlike any other gaming experience, the world of Dereth has changed with 
    each and every month -- be it with the additions of new lands to explore, 
    new creatures to battle, or new quests on which to embark. Towns, and 
    seasons, have come and gone. Players have helped to advance the history of 
    the world, fending off invasions of Shadows. . . and their eerily traveling 
    Spires. This month marks the one-year anniversary of Asheron's Call, and 
    we're set to soon open our next major event, “<i><b>Should the Stars Fall</b></i>,”. 
    Considering the past year, much can be expected! Continue your part in this 
    incredible on-going story, and we'll see you in Dereth! </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">November 14, 2000 </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the 
      world of Dereth has changed with each and every month. Whether the frosts 
      of winter or the leaves of fall, the seasons of this world have come and 
      gone. As have its towns -- following the destruction of Arwic and Tufa, 
      the desert oasis, Xarabydun, was quickly resettled. Heroes have even 
      helped drive forward the history of the world, particularly through the 
      destruction of the Soul Crystals. By doing so, such heroes rescued Dereth 
      from eternal winter, stopped the Shadow invasions, and even stilled the 
      menacing travels of the Spires. Yet fierce debate continues as to whether 
      these actions have all been wise. . . </font>
      <p>
      <img alt="Should the Stars Fall" src="Stars/img_maceflail.jpg" align="left" width="222" height="125"><font face="Arial" size="2">As November marks the one-year anniversary 
      of Asheron's Call, we've opened our next world-altering event: “<i>Should 
      the Stars Fall</i>.” What can be expected this month? &nbsp; </font>
      <p>&nbsp;<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The world of Dereth has grown. While 
    adventurers have been ever persistent in exploring the wild, the more they 
    search, the more they only seem to uncover. Another of Dereth's far-flung 
    corners has been found -- a chain of islands, each one more dangerous than 
    the next. The islands have proven inhabited, both with two creatures never 
    before encountered -- the fierce moarsmen and serpentine slithis -- as well 
    as unseen varieties of monsters previously known to Dereth. Then there are 
    the islands' mysterious refugees. Long lost since the days of Olthoi rule, 
    the refugees apparently survived these many years within their settlements 
    of Kryst and MacNiall's Freehold. What other secrets these islands might 
    hold, none can say. Only, that they promise much for heroes holding all 
    levels of experience. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to this island chain, explorers 
    have stumbled across numerous uncharted dungeon entrances throughout the 
    rest of Dereth -- including one to the mosswarts' deadly labyrinths. Upon 
    the landscape above, certain monsters also continue gathering into training 
    camps, threatening to organize into deadly legions. The beasts of Dereth 
    have been busy, it would seem, establishing themselves in hidden lairs dark 
    and deep. Again, aid from all levels of heroes has been requested to help 
    clear these dungeon halls. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet surely such danger cannot be without its 
    reward. Rumors often spread of powerful treasures carefully hidden away. One 
    of the most recent treasures spoken of: a weapon, a spear of legendary 
    renown. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth has indeed undergone tremendous 
    changes. What's more, its history begins a new, and quite terrifying 
    chapter. Several months ago, the Shadows invaded, their Spires eerily 
    traversing across the land. However, the heroes of Dereth responded. Braving 
    the Spires, gathering mystic keys, they delved deep into hidden Vestibules 
    to combat the crystalline entities stored within. This month, history 
    continues. Heroes will come to face a very grave evil in Dereth -- one 
    primordial to the world itself! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting 
    additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all 
    changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out 
    everything that's been added or changed! Also, some changes provide ways for 
    players to drive our evolving story forward, and thus we won't entirely 
    reveal them here. As usual, though, the town criers, barkeeps, and scribes 
    may know the latest news. Also, the trades of crafting and selling are 
    always in flux, so changes to prices and abilities of items are not always 
    listed here in their entirety. </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Highlights include: </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Exciting new lands have opened for players 
      of all levels to explore. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Many dungeons have been discovered on the 
      new chain of islands -- dungeons for every level of player. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Two entirely brand new species of monsters 
      have appeared, as well as many new variations of monsters currently known 
      to Dereth. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Crystal Array quests have been made a 
      little friendlier. The keys to the Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and Shendolain 
      Vestibules can now be given away. Also, the final reward items not only 
      weigh less, but are now less likely to be lost upon death. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The animation speed for equipping and 
      un-equipping bows and crossbows has been increased. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">People with the old style heaumes will 
      find that they now have the old style artwork back. The artwork that was 
      used in October to replace the heaume will now become its own type of helm 
      called an “armet.” </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Improvements have been made to the Atlan 
      spear, mace, and dagger. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Sturdy Iron Key now has a unique icon 
      so that it can't be easily confused with other keys. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The upper limit for the Grievous Vault has 
      been removed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Now when you appraise monsters, their 
      levels no longer fluctuate. <br>

    <p><span class="Head"><b>A Year in the Virtual Life </b>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    My first exposure to Dereth came well over a year ago, now. I still remember 
    my first forays into the world back in beta -- I even remember the first 
    magic item I ever found. It was a bronze simi with Blood Drinker II, taken 
    from a barker mosswart. I thought it was awesome. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Reviewing old patch notes, it's pretty 
    amazing how much we've managed to add and improve. Dozens upon dozens of new 
    quests, spells, dungeons, monsters, treasures to claim, and two large new 
    landmasses to explore -- all without resorting to an “expansion pack.” To 
    us, Dereth will never be “done.” It's an evolving world, but evolution is a 
    double-edged sword, at times. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ideally, the litmus test that we apply to any 
    change is as follows: “Will the long-term effects of this change improve 
    AC?” And that's never an easy question to answer. Rarely can the full 
    effects of something be judged right away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whenever we change or add anything at all, 
    the feedback pours in. And believe me when I say that we hear it loud and 
    clear. More often than not, however, that feedback is incredibly mixed -- 
    good points are raised on all sides, positive and negative. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gamers that play MMORPGs are among the most 
    adaptable and creative beings on this planet. Despite any initial outrage, 
    people tend to come up with half a dozen solutions to any setback. There was 
    a huge outcry when the range of Drain and Harm spells was reduced, but I 
    don't think you'd find too many people today who would say that the change 
    wasn't for the best. On the other hand, there have been issues where the 
    feedback has been pretty unanimous, such as with the difficulty versus 
    reward for the Soul Crystal quests. In cases like this, we'll often make the 
    appropriate changes; with the Soul Crystal quests, this meant making the 
    keys transferable in order to make the quests more accessible, as well as 
    making the rewards a little sweeter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, in a few months it's unlikely that 
    people will be talking at all about the previous imbalance, or the 
    improvements we made. Remember what life was like before the Atlan weapons? 
    They simply meld into the world of Dereth -- another subtle evolution, 
    another subtle growth. The one-year anniversary, however, gives us a good 
    milestone at which we can look back and truly appreciate some of the 
    progress we've made. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And yet, as far as we've come, there's still 
    plenty more to do. Some of the changes have had unexpected results. Players 
    continue to amaze us with their ingenuity, and their voracious appetite for 
    new and exciting content. So we'll continue providing such content, with 
    more enhancements, new plotlines, and challenging events to come. </font>

      Nik@turbine&gt; Hey there. Just wanted to clear up what's probably the most 
      pressing question, before we get started. That pesky Thistledown soul 
      crystal... First of all, the bug. It's one that we've wanted to see 
      squashed for a long time, and we've finally nailed it. Barring disaster, 
      it should be fixed in December. That doesn't do much for the situation at 
      hand, however. Despite the fact that the story will go on, one way or the 
      other, I want it to be known that the defense of the crystal will NOT go 
      unnoticed. In fact, we're incredibly impressed with the defense thus far. 
      Still, this issue simply does not meet our criteria for a hotfix, nor can 
      Sentinels get involved in any way. We're as frustrated with the outcome as 
      anybody, but that's the way things are at the moment. As such, we reserve 
      the right to pass on any questions that I've covered. Anyway, I've taken 
      up enough time... on the the questions! <br>
      <br>
      +Chaos@AC&gt; Thanks Nik! <br>

      cardell@turbine&gt; New monsters in Dereth are coming in at increasingly high 
      levels. In any skill based system, level is not always a direct indication 
      of what that monster excels in. <br>

      cardell@turbine&gt; Recently, in order to make new monsters more challenging, 
      they have been made more resistant to magic. <br>

      cardell@turbine&gt; It is still quite possible to land spells on many of the 
      new monsters, as none of them are totally immune. <br>
      <br>
      cardell@turbine&gt; In the future, we are moving away from totally immune 
      monsters such as the Lugian Miner/Raider, so that the entire playerbase 
      can sample what is new each month. <br>

      that difficult. There have been several ideas presented such as slings, or 
      things like the atl-atl that ancient indians (or something like that) had. 
      Something you can buff with item spells. <br>
      <br>
      Akmahon&gt; Also making thrown weapons fletchable or at least easier to find 
      with elementals would be good. Been busy lately so I havn't been able to 
      explore all the new island stuff, but from what I've seen its great! 
      Thanks guys. <br>

      alt98&gt; When Turbine created the Mage and all there powers; was the Mage

      cardell@turbine&gt; Mages were intended to be versatile based off of the 
      spells that you can cast. <br>
      <br>
      cardell@turbine&gt; With the way the spell economy has turned out, the mage 
      is the most versatile character on Dereth. <br>

      be &quot;support&quot; characters exclusively. <br>

	However, there are some players using a bug that allows them to summon any 
	portal in order to get into the Catacombs. We are working on a fix to this 
	bug, but unfortunately, it is not likely to come this month. We apologize 
	for the inconvenience. <br>
	<br>
	<b>I tried learning the Recall the Sanctuary spell but every time I do, I 
	end up stuck in portal space and have to log out. When I return, the spell 
	does not appear in my spellbook. What is going on?</b><br>
	<br>
	We are aware of this situation and are investigating it. We hope to have it 
	fixed soon. You may also want to look for the scroll that teaches you this 
	spell. It is working as expected. </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">The fiercest enemy 
    Archibald and Cuthbert faced thus far, hiking across the Vesayen Isles? 
    Jungle branches. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>The two knights had been forced to use their weapons not as 
    swords of justice, but as brush-clearing machetes.<br>
    <br>
    Where in Dereth is that next bridge?&quot; Cuthbert of the Pyreal Halo spat, 
    pausing to wipe the sweat from his brow. <br>
    <br>
    His partner, Archibald of the Crooked Arrow, planted his sword into the 
    muddy earth, leaning against its hilt.<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;&quot;They did say somewhere along the 
    edge of this island. Perhaps we should head back to MacNiall's Freehold and 
    ask again?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;And pay those pirates more? Never! We'll find the true path.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    The explorers who originally found the archipelago chain claimed each of the 
    thirteen islands grew more dangerous along the way. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Though, of course, they 
    had not made it to the last island to verify this theory. When asked of the 
    dangers that turned them back, the explorers paled and spoke of certain 
    creatures never before seen. Archibald and Cuthbert, hearing the tale, vowed 
    to the reach the isles' end. <br>
    <br>
    Chopping through a final tangle of vine, they finally found themselves on 
    the far shore of the island. No bridge, however, could be seen. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Any danger?&quot; Archibald asked, stooped over to catch his breath. <br>
    <br>
    Cuthbert scanned the horizon, shielding his eyes under one hand. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;I see no shallow sharks nor water golems….&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Fine! Then here we'll rest!&quot; Archibald threw his sword down to the sand, 
    his weary body following close behind. <br>
    <br>
    Cuthbert turned to chastise the fallen knight. With his back to the sea, he 
    failed to observe the slithering of what he'd taken to be mere seaweed. 
    &quot;Ware, Archibald! We've come too far along not to worry about danger 
    striking any moment.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    When he turned back around, he found that the &quot;seaweed&quot; had arisen. 
    Tentacles poised in the air. An eyestalk wavered. The knights had met their 
    first monstrous denizen of the islands. A slithis. </font></p>

    THE STARS FALL</font><font size="2"><br>
	The latest monthly event, &quot;Should the Stars Fall,&quot; opened November 14th -- 
    marking one full year of Asheron's Call! As promised, every month has seen a 
    major world-altering event, from &quot;Shadows of the Past,&quot; to &quot;Thorns of the 
    Hopeslayer,&quot; to &quot;Sudden Season.&quot; <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>These events have added new lands, new 
    monsters, new dungeons and quests; with the latest event, all this and more 
    has arrived in Dereth!<br>
    <br>
    The Vesayen Isles, off the southeastern coast near Mayoi, have been found 
    and explored by many. (Exact locations can even be found on the Crossroads 
    of Dereth site.) While the islands are open to all levels of players, and 
    two towns, Kryst and MacNiall's Freehold, offer brief respite -- beware! 
    Many creatures lurk just within the fringes of the nearby jungle. These 
    include over twenty-five new variations of known monsters, not to mention 
    two species completely original to the game -- the moarsmen and the 
    tentacle-draped slithis. The count rises to three when considering the 
    fearsome idols in the latter islands…. For more information on these latest 
    creatures, be sure to check out the updated bestiaries of AC Stratics, 
    Asheron's Lore, and AC Tips. <br>
    <br>
    Throughout the course of Dereth's history, the largest roles have been 
    played both by powerful crystal entities and the heroes facing them. As 
    player actions directly advance the story of the game, their assaults on the 
    crystals have led to the release of evolved crystalline varieties, the end 
    of winter's spell, and the defeat of the Shadows Spires. The destruction of 
    the Vestibule crystals has even resulted in the discovery of unique and 
    mystic treasure. Yet can every outcome benefit the world? Though the Spires 
    have been faced, fresh danger blossoms constantly across the land. A score 
    of new dungeons, for players of all levels, have been discovered. Monsters 
    continue to assemble in their training camps. And the Vesayen island chain, 
    while welcoming to all, will only allow the most determined to reach its 
    end. There, sages whisper, the secret of the crystals but continues…. Full 
    details on November's event can be found in the official roll-out article, 
    &quot;Should the Stars Fall.&quot; A more comprehensive, and technical list, of 
    changes can be read in the official developer's notes.<br>

    A LETTER TO THE PLAYERS<br>
    The true consequences of shattering the last Soul Stone are known at last. 
    Bael'Zharon, the dread Hopeslayer, has been unleashed upon Dereth. While the 
    Soul Stone has fallen on every world save one, as of yet, the defense still 
    holds on Thistledown. The AC team recently composed their thoughts on this 
    valiant defense and its possible impact on the game, stating, &quot;Regardless of 
    the outcome of this effort, Thistledown will still always be remembered as 
    the site of an epic battle never before seen in gaming.&quot; The full letter can 
    be read here. <br>
    <br>
    A GATHERING OF MONSTERS <br>
    &quot;In recent days, hints, and captured notes, and even occasional sightings 
    tell of further danger in the land. Certain creatures of Dereth have begun 
    organizing into camps.&quot; Begun in last month's &quot;Hollow Victory&quot; event, 
    monster-training camps have sprung up across the landscape, providing heroes 
    with plenty of good hunting. The first of such camps appeared in Osteth and 
    on the Obsidian Plain. Now with the latest event, even more camps have been 
    spotted. While many kills, and much experience, can be gained in these 
    areas, their very presence in Dereth troubles many.… More on the monster 
    training camps can be read here.<br>

    A new monarch has come to rule Dereth: Thase Skotoso. A rank 8 Taikou

    Organizing a rampaging mob is not as easy as it sounds, as Fargo of 
    GameSpy.com recently discovered. Disturbed by the current events ongoing in 
    Dereth, he began the campaign to &quot;burn the beast.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Here's a handy checklist for inciting a mob to riot in your favorite 
    massively multiplayer online RPG:&quot; </p>
    <p>1. Buy a bunch of torches<br>
    2. Distribute them to a nearby mob<br>
    3. Prepare some handy speech macros for easy chanting. I suggest:<br>
    &quot;Burn the Beast&quot;<br>
    &quot;Burn the Beast!&quot;<br>
    and the always-influential, &quot;BURN THE BEAST!!&quot; </p>
    <p>For full coverage of Fargo's campaign, be sure to check out the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespy.com/fargo/november00/BurnTheBeast/">

    <p>Also, GameSpy.com has recently composed its own top 10 list, this time of 
    the best items in the game. &quot;In celebration of the one-year anniversary of 
    Asheron's Call, we present to you a list of 10 of the most famous items in 
    Asheron's Call. These aren't necessarily the best items in the game, the 
    phatest of the phat, or the most common, but are items that most players 
    know about and want at some stage of the game. Most of these items are still 
    available in the game to players with enough desire and experience.&quot; The
