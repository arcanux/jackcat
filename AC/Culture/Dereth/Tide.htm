    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&quot;This discourse is at an end, Ciandra. There 
    are no words left between us.&quot; Nuhmudira's words, laced with venom, stung 
    Ciandra deeply.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I only —&quot; Nuhmudira glared at the younger 
    woman. Ciandra felt compelled to become silent, but finished her statement. 
    &quot;I have only continued your work.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You have done no such thing.&quot; The words fell 
    like a hammer on an anvil, each word purposeful and accentuated. Nuhmudira's 
    eyes grew dark. &quot;You have turned to him. Time and again, you have turned to 
    him. Why?&quot; She stepped toward Ciandra. &quot;He sits alone in his tower, meddling 
    with us only when it suits his purpose. He has lied to us and used us and 
    yet you turn to him, not your mentor, your teacher, your friend.&quot; She paused 
    briefly.&nbsp; &quot;Tell me Ciandra, can you explain why it is you turned to Asheron? 
    Can you tell me when you first went to see him? When it was that you sought 
    him out for understanding and enlightenment?&quot; Ciandra searched her mind for 
    the answer. &quot;Yes, that is right Ciandra, he sought you first.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How did you —&quot; Ciandra began to ask.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Now you wish to turn to me for answers, 
    student?&quot; She motioned for Ciandra to leave. &quot;The strain of seeing you at 
    Elysa's Council is the most I will suffer. Do not seek me out again, child.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ciandra was taken aback. She tried to meet 
    Nuhmudira's eyes but her old teacher was already moving across the room 
    toward a desk. She turned, opened the cottage door, and headed out into the 
    night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Is she the next one, then?&quot; The voice came 
    from the shadows. A man, neither tall nor broad, stood there. His deep-set 
    eyes glinted in the candlelight.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;No. She is precious to me still.&quot; Nuhmudira 
    sat at her desk. &quot;She also strives toward the same goals as I. Her efforts 
    thus far have been remarkable, and she leads the Arcanum well in my stead. I 
    think that Ciandra shall remain, I think that she will have a use in the 
    future.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Did you feel that?&quot; Anton asked Gent, who 
    sat across the table. They were in Eastham, sharing a pint, while Gent 
    worked on fitting his armor with a myriad of salvaged goods.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Feel what?&quot; Gent asked, half-paying 
    attention.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Tremor,&quot; Anton replied and looked toward the 
    project Gent was working on.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Tremor, what's that?&quot; Gent dropped a few 
    more gems into his ust and ground them down.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;When the ground shakes, you know?&quot; Anton 
    smirked and took a swallow of his ale.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The ground shook just then?&quot; Gent shook the 
    bag and made sure that it was full.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You felt it too, then?&quot; asked Anton 
    swallowing hard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Felt what?&quot; Gent retorted, looking up at his 
    friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Tremor.&quot;&nbsp; Anton placed the mug of ale on the 
    table and took up a piece of bread.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You mean like when the ground shakes?&quot; Gent 
    rocked back away from his armor and looked over his shoulder at his friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Anton nodded in confirmation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You just told me a tremor is when the ground 
    shakes.&quot; Gent shrugged and turned back to his armor, hoisting it onto a 
    table and taking up residence on a stool.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yes. Did you feel it then?&quot; Anton asked with 
    his mouth full.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What? A tremor?&quot; Gent asked as he began 
    polishing the armor and preparing it for a most critical attempt at imbuing 
    the fine metals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Anton answered, becoming increasingly 
    frustrated.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Well I felt something shake, but I thought 
    it was just me trying to get this armor imbued. It's not easy you know, one 
    wrong move and —&quot;&nbsp; His response was cut short as the ground shook again, 
    tossing both of them to the ground. In the process the armor was left 
    cracked and broken.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Bollocks! I felt that one. Look at me 
    armor.&quot; Gent bent down to pick up the pieces, and looked at Anton, whose ear 
    was pressed firmly to the barroom floor. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Listening,&quot; Anton responded, shushing him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;To what?&quot; Gent lowered himself down toward 
    his friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Don't know yet. But it sounds like 
    something's moving; digging.&quot; He lifted his ear from the floor and looked at 
    his friend with wide eyes. &quot;Not something… thousands of somethings.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She tested the walls of the tunnel, exerting 
    pressure against the ceiling, pressing against the walls, all in an effort 
    to ensure the safety of her children. Her workers had done well. She called 
    to her eldest children and instructed them to organize their broods. The 
    time to move was upon them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The tunnels stretched endlessly into the 
    dark, but she still felt her other children somewhere beyond. She could also 
    sense the <em>thing</em> that had given her the scar. The magic of the wound 
    was still active after all these years. Soon she would complete what she had 
    started so long ago. The last of the <em>things</em> that had brought her to 
    this world would perish, and then she would stand as the supreme ruler.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her forces already covered all livable 
    locations, and though her contact with the hive she had sent to destroy the
    <em>thing</em> had been severed hundred of years ago, she could feel them 
    now. They were without direction and lost, save for a small collection that 
    was held under the control of another lesser Queen. She had already exerted 
    her control over that brood and commanded their construction of tunnels to 
    the new mainland. The two broods would meet in the middle and bring this 
    land under her sway as well.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But there was something else that needed to 
    be done first. She watched as her children marched in columns behind her 
    eldest. She watched as they spread along the tunnels that stretched off into 
    unknown darkness. She watched and directed them to the <em>thing</em>. It 
    would whimper before her, it would make the noises that others like it had 
    made, and she would finally be content.</font></p>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Two new features show up when you ID an 
      object.&nbsp; When you ID armor, you will now see the exact numeric value of 
      armor protection to the various elements in addition to the traditional 
      descriptive phrase.&nbsp; Also, all items will now display a number of

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to an issue with Zbuffering on some

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Natural resistance no longer affects the

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The damage modifiers on the Weeping Bow, 
      Crossbow, and Atlatl have been adjusted, as has the slayer bonus on the

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Thrown weapons have seen some changes, 
      including changes to the damage done by spikes and atlatl darts.&nbsp; In 
      addition, treasure-generated atlatls and some quest atlatls have had their 
      damage modifiers changed.&nbsp; See the

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Barbed Fletching Tool can be used on

      arrowheads).&nbsp; In addition, barbed arrowheads of all sorts can be used to 
      make atlatl darts. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Light bows and crossbows are now more 
      useful, with the potential to do more damage. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some creatures on the landscape were 
      spawning faster than intended.&nbsp; This could cause problems for players 
      while hunting, as well as cause problems for the servers.&nbsp; We've slowed 
      these creatures down a bit. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly, the rate at which some 
      creatures summon their minions has been slowed down. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A few recent creatures have had their 
      health, armor, and attacks tweaked slightly in order to bring them more in 
      line with their intended difficulty. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Runed chests with a lockpick resistance of

    <br>
    </font><strong><font size="2">A Groundbreaking Opportunity<br>
    </font></strong><font size="2"><br>
    The contest to name the new town has gone smashingly so far! After receiving 
    more than 900 suggestions, our elite panel of monkey judges laboriously 
    picked their favorite five entries. It was a tough choice! As I write this, 
    the players are voting—and campaigning strenuously—for their personal pick. 
    Remember, the final winner will be announced at the ACPL on July 12th. Don't 
    miss it!<br>
    <br>
    </font><strong><font size="2">New Tinkering Effects<br>
    </font></strong><font size="2"><br>
    The July update contains a wide variety of new tinkering effects, including 
    both tinkers and imbues. Here are in-depth explanations of each.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Resistance Rending Imbues<br>
    <br>
    </strong>Resistance Rending describes a new set of weapon imbues—one for 
    each damage type—that increases the damage the imbued weapon inflicts with 
    that damage type. In other words, Resistance Rending is like a built-in 
    elemental Vulnerability spell. However—and this is important!—Resistance 
    Rending and Vulnerability spells do not stack. If, for instance, you are 
    attacking with a Slashing Rend Tachi and the target is currently suffering 
    under a Blade Vulnerability spell, then your attack will only receive the 
    benefit of one effect—whichever is larger. Note that the magnitude of the 
    Resistance Rending effect depends on the attack skill of the weapon's 
    wielder.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike previous weapon imbues, Resistance 
    Rending materials are applied using the Weapon Tinkering skill. Resistance 
    Rending imbues can be applied to any treasure-generated melee weapon, 
    missile weapon, or magic caster, but remember that an item can only ever be 
    imbued with one effect, so choose carefully. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Jewelry Cantrip Imbues<br>
    <br>
    </strong>Thanks to the hard work of the Arcanum, it will soon be possible 
    for skilled tinkers to add certain cantrip spells to magical jewelry. For 
    now, the list of cantrips that can be added is relatively short, and these 
    cantrips can only be applied to magical, treasure-generated jewelry, but 
    it's a start!</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The cantrips that can be imbued into jewelry 
    in July include: Minor Strength, Minor Endurance, Minor Coordination, Minor 
    Quickness, Minor Focus, Minor Self, Warrior's Vitality, Warrior's Vigor, 
    Wizard's Intellect, Minor Health Gain, Minor Stamina Gain, and Minor Mana 
    Gain. Imbuing a piece of jewelry uses the Magic Item Tinkering skill, and 
    also raises the Arcane Lore requirement and the Spellcraft of the piece by 
    25 points. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Armor Defense Imbues<br>
    <br>
    </strong>In July we usher in our first three armor imbues, one for each 
    defense skill. These effects imbue a piece of treasure-generated armor with 
    a +1 stackable defense bonus. This defense bonus, like the defense modifier 
    on a weapon, only comes into play during an attack—it does not help you meet 
    skill requirements nor show up on your skill panel. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Armor defense imbues can be applied with the 
    Armor Tinkering skill to any piece of treasure-generated armor, including 
    Covenant Armor. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Requirement Tinkering<br>
    <br>
    </strong>This month also introduces six new tinkering effects that deal with 
    the activation requirements on an item. All of them are regular tinkers—not 
    imbues—and all use the Item Tinkering skill. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Three of the materials can be used on an item 
    with a heritage activation requirement to change that heritage requirement 
    to a different one. Which heritage requirement you end up with depends on 
    which material you use.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Two of the materials can be used on an item with a Melee Defense or Missile 
    Defense activation requirement. These materials swap the skill 
    requirements—Melee Defense becomes Missile Defense, or vice versa—and also 
    change the level of the requirement to account for the differences in the 
    skills' attribute formulas. In other words, going from Melee Defense to 
    Missile Defense lowers the requirement somewhat; going the other way raises 
    it somewhat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Lastly, one material can only be used 
    on items with an allegiance rank activation requirement. This material 
    removes the rank requirement, but in exchange sets the Arcane Lore 
    difficulty of the item equal to the item's Spellcraft.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Leather Tinkering<br>
    <br>
    </strong>The last new tinkering effect for July is a special one: you can 
    use Salvaged Leather on an item to mark the item as 'Retained'. Retained 
    items cannot be salvaged or sold to vendors. Like Ivory, Leather does not 
    require any tinkering skill to apply, it does not add to the number of times 
    the target has been tinkered, and there is no chance that applying Leather 
    can destroy the target.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Covenant Armor Tinkering<br>
    <br>
    </strong>Originally, Covenant Armor could not be tinkered at all. Later, 
    tinkers found a way to apply Item Tinkering materials to Covenant Armor. And 
    now, starting with the July update, Covenant Armor can be tinkered with all 
    the materials that can normally be applied to armor except Steel. Steel 
    remains one material that just will not apply to Covenant Armor, no matter 
    what the poor tinkers of Dereth do. <br>
    <br>
    </font><strong><font size="2">Appraisal Panel Additions<br>
    </font></strong><font size="2"><br>
    Starting with the July update, the Item Appraisal panel displays some new 
    information. First off, you will now be able to see exact numeric values—in 
    addition to the existing descriptive phrase—to tell you how well your armor 
    protects you from the various elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Secondly, we've added a few new types of 
    &quot;Special Properties&quot; to the panel. In addition to listing imbues and slayer 
    types, and telling you if an item is unenchantable, the &quot;Special Properties&quot; 
    section will now also list the following qualities (if they are applicable):</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Bonded:</em> This item has no chance 
      to drop to your corpse when you die (a.k.a.&nbsp; &quot;no drop&quot;). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Dropped on Death:</em> This item will 
      always drop to your corpse when you die. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Destroyed on Death:</em> This item 
      will be destroyed when you die. The non-upgraded Singularity weapons are a 
      good example of this. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Attuned:</em> This item cannot be 
      transferred to another player, or placed on the ground or in an external 
      container (a.k.a. &quot;no give&quot;). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>Retained:</em> This item cannot be 
      sold to a vendor or salvaged.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><font size="2" face="Arial">Thrown Weapons Changes</font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    <br>
    The July update includes several small tweaks to thrown weapons, including 
    changes to the damage done by spikes and atlatl darts. But a more important 
    change for thrown weapons involves the damage modifiers on 
    treasure-generated atlatls. The following chart illustrates these changes.</font></p>

    quest atlatls and those that had been upgraded recently; atlatls that are 
    part of older quests will be updated when we upgrade their respective 
    quests. <br>

    </font><strong><font size="2">The Ongoing Saga<br>
    </font></strong><font size="2"><br>
    Last month, it became abundantly clear that the appearance of increased 
    Olthoi activity is no illusion. The Olthoi on both Marae Lassel and Dereth 
    itself are on the move, digging ever deeper towards some unfathomable goal. 
    Asheron, holed up in his island tower, has no answer for us yet, and Queen 
    Elysa, alarmed by the growing threats—from the Olthoi, the Renegade Lugian 
    and Tumeroks, and now the murder of a member of her Council—is left 
    wondering whom she can trust.</font></font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Arial">By Alex &quot;Ibn&quot; Beckers</font><p>
    <font size="2" face="Arial">In July's event, &quot;A Swelling Tide&quot;, we introduce 
    a number of new tinkering effects. We discussed these in the July
    <a href="http://microsoftgamesinsider.com/AC1/JulyLttP.htm">Letter to the 
    Players</a> but many of you had further questions and requests for 
    clarification.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">General Imbue Questions</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will the new imbues have the 33% 
    maximum chance of success?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will we ever allow an item to 
    receive more than one imbue?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> We have no plans at this time to add this ability.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">Resistance Rending Imbues</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: What happens if we imbue a weapon 
    with Resistance Rending for a damage type that it doesn't deal? (For example 
    imbuing a Fire Tachi with Cold Resistance Rending.) Similarly, what happens 
    if I use Fire Arrows with a bow that has been imbued with Cold Resistance 
    Rending?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> The imbue will take, but will have no effect. Likewise, the 
    Resistance Rending on a missile weapon will only have an effect when you use 
    the appropriate ammunition type.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: How much extra damage will a 
    Resistance Rend do?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> At maximum effective skill, it is roughly equivalent to a level VI 
    vulnerability spell.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will Resistance Rending work with 
    wands?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes. This will primarily benefit mages by reducing the need to 
    cast a vulnerability spell before attacking with war magic.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will Resistance Rending on a wand 
    also affect any war spell that the wand itself can cast? For example if I 
    have a wand with a built-in Acid Blast V, will Acid Resistance Rending 
    improve the damage?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will Resistance Rending affect 
    life spells such as drains and harms?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Not at this time, and we have no immediate plans to add this 
    functionality.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will Resistance Rend on a wand 
    work differently than on a melee weapon or missile weapon, similar to how 
    Critical Strike and Crippling Blow work differently?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Critical Strike and Crippling Blow work differently for wands 
    because criticals work differently for wands. This difference doesn't apply 
    to Resistance Rending.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">Jewelry Cantrip Imbues</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will the jewelry imbues affect 
    the maximum mana and mana burn rate of the item?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> No.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will you be making more minors 
    available for imbuing?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> We'd like to see how well the existing ones work before adding new 
    ones, but it is certainly a possibility.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Can we imbue jewelry that is not 
    currently magical?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> No.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">Armor Defense Imbues</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Could you provide more details 
    about the Armor Defense imbues?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> It's an imbue, so you can do it once and only once to any piece of 
    armor. The maximum chance of success is 33%, like all imbues. And the bonus 
    you get is +1 skill point, not +1%. You can imbue the piece with a bonus to 
    melee defense, missile defense, or magic defense. </font></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So you can build a suit that, with all of its 
    pieces, gives you +10 melee defense, or +5 melee defense and +5 magic 
    defense, or what have you. These bonuses stack with any spells or weapon 
    modifiers you have.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Each effect -- Melee Defense, Missile 
    Defense, or Magic Defense -- is a separate imbue.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: The Armor Defense imbues appear 
    to be underpowered, considering the 66% risk of failure even in a best case.</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> When creating new dynamics like this, we generally start 
    cautiously to avoid potentially doing awful things to game balance. We will 
    pay close attention to your feedback and look into adjusting the imbues in 
    the future if necessary.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">Requirement Tinkering</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will changing requirements on an 
    item also affect any wield requirements?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> No, they will only change the activation requirements.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: If I have an item that has a rank 
    requirement in addition to other requirements and I remove the rank 
    requirement, will the new arcane lore requirement take into account the 
    other requirements?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Unfortunately no, the new arcane lore difficulty will be set equal 
    to the spellcraft. Any heritage or skill requirement will no longer provide 
    a benefit. This is a technology limitation.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Can we add heritage requirements?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Not at this time, and we have no immediate plans to add this 
    functionality.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Can hilted weapons be affected by 
    the requirement tinkering effects?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> At this time, no hilted weapons can be tinkered, nor can you hilt 
    a tinkered weapon. We are considering removing this restriction for the 
    requirement tinkers, but we haven't reached a decision yet.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><i><b><font size="2">Leather Tinkering</font></b></i><font size="2">
    </font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will Retained items (tinkered 
    with leather) still be tinkerable?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Yes.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Are Retained items also Bonded 
    (no-drop)?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> No, Retained items will still be droppable on death.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Can Retained items be destroyed 
    by using a mana stone on them?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> At this time, yes. We would like to change this in the future.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Will they be only wieldable by 
    the tinkerer, like the Ivory tinker?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> No.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Q: Can quest items be Retained?</font></b><font size="2"><br>
    <b>A:</b> Not at this time, although this is something that we will look at 
    in the future, time allowing.</font></font><br>
