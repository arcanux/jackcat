    <font size="2"><b>January 19, 2000</b><br>
    <br>
    After his long journey gathering spell components, Kobo Taki hurried through 
    his estate, barely pausing in the courtyard to greet his gardeners, who 
    labored among puddles and dwindling humps of snow. Once in his study, he 
    locked the door and, after a quick search, located the book he needed and 
    scanned frantically through its pages for a particular passage: &quot;If the 
    crystal breaks, its scions will appear and shadows will well up over the 
    earth.&quot; Did this apply to the floating crystals and shadow creatures he'd 
    seen on his journey? Finding no more information, he pulled a chair up to 
    the window and gazed over the waterlogged fields. It was common knowledge 
    that a band of heroes had dispelled the recent winter. After battling their 
    way to the lair of undead necromancers, they had destroyed the giant crystal 
    that sucked the heat from the land. Perhaps this crystal was the one in the 
    text. If so, the heroes may have unwittingly brought down a terrible 
    curse... </font></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a name="2"></a>From the 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewsdarkthaw1.asp">Zone</a></small></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>January 21, 2000</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kobo Taki confronted a throng of impassive 
    Gharu'ndim as he finished his initial proposal to the Zaikhal council. They 
    had all agreed that the strange crystal beings and shadow monsters demanded 
    some concerted action, but as he suspected, they doubted the various rogue 
    mages would ever cooperate. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Let's be frank,&quot; said Asaina al-Arqis. 
    &quot;Mages guard their knowledge too closely. The most powerful ones will never 
    form fellowships.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kobo smiled. &quot;They already have. I represent 
    a consortium of the Archmages.&quot; A murmuring went up immediately as the 
    council members turned to each other for corroboration. &quot;Yes,&quot; he went on, 
    &quot;they exist, and they've determined that the forces now gathering against 
    humanity demand that magicians cooperate. Already they have finished an 
    ambitious joint project: a series of magical robes. Each of the robes 
    temporarily increases the wearer's aptitude in a particular magic 
    discipline; however, to achieve this effect, it also weakens the wearer in 
    other areas of magic. A given robe is therefore a dangerous tool for a 
    single mage, but a set of the robes may greatly enhance a well-balanced 
    party.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This is indeed intriguing,&quot; said Asaina, 
    &quot;but why have the Archmages not come forward themselves to make this 
    announcement, and where can we acquire these robes?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;My masters are occupied with their work,&quot; he 
    replied. &quot;As for acquiring the robes, you must address them in person.&quot;
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;And where can they be found?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kobo smiled once again. &quot;I do not know -- 
    they contact me when the mood suits them. They ask that we work together to 
    seek them out.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Dereth's heroes have destroyed the Great 
    Work, an artifact created by undead necromancers to drain the heat from the 
    world. As a result, the snow has retreated to higher elevations, along with 
    the enchanted snowmen, but grave new perils are stalking out to confront 
    adventurers. Thankfully, new magic robes have been created just in time to 
    address these threats. We urge you to avail yourselves of the robes and any 
    other magical adjuncts and join forces. No one knows what these hostile new 
    creatures may ultimately portend.<br>

      </a>Allegiance Problem on Leafcull </b>- From the Zone (Jan. 21, 2000)</font></span></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="arial">On the afternoon of 1/20/2000, after the January update 
      was made, players in Leafcull immediately noticed something had gone wrong 
      with their allegiances. Their allegiance associations were broken or had 
      reverted to the state they were in days or weeks ago. No other problems 
      seem to have occurred, and no other worlds were affected. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We immediately investigated and found what had happened. 
    Some time ago, a never-before-seen bug affected the Leafcull transaction log 
    of our player database. Unnoticed by us, this bug prevented the log from 
    being truncated properly, so it swelled quickly to a huge size and overran 
    its hard drive. As a result, many subsequent transactions were not recorded. 
    When the Leafcull server was restarted for the update, these transaction 
    logs were used to rebuild the allegiances, but the rebuild stopped at an old 
    state, since the latest transactions were never recorded. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Though we do character database backups, this particular 
    kind of problem was not anticipated. Most of the database is fine, but this 
    part describing the allegiances is lost. We had an option to restore the 
    whole Leafcull character database to the most recent backup, but that would 
    set every single player back in time: experience points, items, locations, 
    allegiances, gold -- everything would &quot;time warp&quot; back. So the dilemma was: 
    Make absolutely everyone lose absolutely everything gained over a small 
    amount of time, or let those with significant allegiance ties lose just 
    those ties, but further back in time? It has been an agonizing decision, but 
    we have decided to let the allegiance associations stay broken. However, we 
    will be looking at everyone's level and award you the XP that it would take 
    to re-swear to an allegiance so that you will end up not being penalized. 
    This will take place by next Friday. You can choose to either reform your 
    allegiance now, with the knowledge that the XP penalty that it takes to 
    re-swear will be awarded back to you late next week, or wait until the XP is 
    awarded. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We are eliminating the bug that made this happen in the 
    first place. We are revising our backup scheme to assure that if anything 
    like this does happen again, we will lose much less data. Doing these tasks 
    is our top priority. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We deeply apologize to the players of Leafcull for this 
    setback. We know it is as if a dark sword swooped from the sky and severed 
    many loyal bonds. We wish we could say an evil force under the surface of 
    Dereth did it, but regrettably, this was a much more mundane problem. We 
    sincerely hope that the players of Leafcull are able to re-forge their bonds 
    to be even stronger than before.</font></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Sometimes, this job just makes me crazy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(The title of this month's article is a sure 
    sign of my encroaching insanity. “The 'U' in 'Fun'?” Sheesh!) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Events are a critical part of Asheron's Call, 
    providing new content to users and advancing the epic saga that will unfold 
    through the years ahead. A large part of our ongoing commitment to Asheron's 
    Call is making them happen, and making them special. But as time goes on, 
    we've found our events (and our team) trying to meet two very different 
    demands: one, to create an experience which provides entertainment for every 
    player in Dereth; and two, to keep pace with your unstoppable creativity and 
    efforts to interpret, master, and foretell what our events may hold. </font>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">To that end, let me take a moment to 
      respond to some “news reports” which have swirled by in months past:
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was <i>never </i>a Frost King, set 
      to unleash hordes of icy creatures upon the world. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are no alien heads in the game . . . 
      yet. (Actually, that's a rumor that a content-team member asked me to 
      start. Honest. Move along.) </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Joffre Tremblant never traveled 
      anywhere near Qalaba'r. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There is no master plan to make every 
      event culminate in a massive invasion of Holtburg by anything, ever.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was never a “secret room” on the 
      side of the Tou-Tou Lighthouse. Seeking it through a well-timed jump got 
      you nothing more than a flatter-than-average corpse. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">No one ever saw meteors actually hit and 
      flatten Shoushi, or experienced first-hand the impact of the crimson comet 
      slamming into Dereth, ending the world and our Beta-testing cycle. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">And Lilitha's Greater Bow is just a gleam 
      in the eyes of many, many eager players. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you get involved with the fansite 
    community or AC newsgroups, or simply hang out in the Zone's chat lobbies 
    (hi, Sean!) -- you may be familiar with many of the above rumors and 
    discussions. Ever since the announcement of our first event, players have 
    sought to piece together various happenings and minutiae into a “big 
    picture” that explains AC's story. In one massive game of “Telephone” 
    reaching beyond Dereth and spanning the Internet, players have turned 
    innocent speculation and conjecture into “My friend saw the Olthoi Queen 
    doing the shimmy on the balcony of the Cerulean Cove! And her dancing's 
    pretty good!” You've conjured an endless stream of forecasts and 
    expectations for the game, more varied and exciting than I think any game 
    could ever accomplish. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I love it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the most thrilling moments I've ever 
    experienced in Asheron's Call came at the end of Beta. The Turbine designers 
    huddled around a couple of computers at the beginning of the “Fire in the 
    Sky” event. We oohed and aahed at the burning towers, rubbed our hands 
    together in anticipation of the first Fire Elementals screaming out of the 
    sky, and (after a brief stop in the Disco Hut) headed to The Crater that Was 
    Shoushi to see how players were reacting to the changes we'd wrought. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Standing amid the stunned vendors at the 
    crater's edge, players admired the property damage, and laughed as an 
    occasional adventurer logged in to the center of town, only to realize it 
    had been replaced with a glowing pit and a swift drop. Scattered 
    conversations tried to piece together what had happened, and what was next. 
    Then, something occurred which hammered home just how cool games like 
    Asheron's Call could get. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Friends! We are doomed! Shoushi is only the 
    beginning! It's the end of the world!” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A player had become Shoushi's unofficial 
    Prophet of Doom*, lamenting what had occurred and declaring what was to 
    come. All he needed to complete the image was a large “The End Is Nigh!” 
    sandwich-board strapped to his body. Even if we'd thought of it, we couldn't 
    have programmed an NPC to navigate the world freely while spouting a 
    potentially endless stream of end-of-world rants. It was a role concocted by 
    this player, uniquely suited to him, and pulled off with panache. He might 
    have stopped after two minutes and run off to bash drudges -- I don't recall 
    -- but the image of this self-styled “town crier” stuck with me. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In that moment, I learned just what roles our 
    players would take in our events -- any and every role we could think of, 
    and several more that we couldn't. At first glance, it seemed that creating 
    events just became much harder -- but in fact, our jobs got significantly 
    cooler. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(Warning! Strained metaphors ahead! Please 
    don your protective goggles!) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron's Call is a game that's larger than 
    the designers, Turbine, or (even!) Microsoft could ever hope to control. The 
    threads of gameplay, story, and exploration we provide are knitted into 
    something greater by the imaginations, desires, and vision of thousands of 
    players. From every seed of content or narrative placed in the game grows a 
    garden of reactions, perspectives, and uniquely personal adventures. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(You may remove your goggles now.) </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When we create an event, we could never hope 
    to produce enough unique, sculpted story-elements to satisfy our thousands 
    of players. But the trick is, we don't have to. When we create something 
    like December's Frore quest, our goal is to create the <i>spine </i>of an 
    adventure, with a series of locations which push the story forward, rewards 
    to be collected, and threats to be overcome. We season it with bits of 
    backstory, garnish with a few hints towards the future of our plot, and top 
    with a malevolent, heat-devouring Crystal-Thingy. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then we get the heck out of the way, and let
    <i>you </i>tell the story to <i>us</i>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We had no idea who would enter Frore first, 
    or how their adventure would unfold. But when the first groups of players 
    conquered the Great Work, they each left Frore with a vivid and unique story 
    to tell. Those are the stories that matter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Stories are nothing without compelling 
    characters; our goal is to tell great stories, collaboratively, with our 
    players as the most important and compelling characters around. More than 
    the technology, more than the game systems that measure when I've moved from 
    level 5 to level 6 (cut me some slack, I just started a new character!) -- 
    it's this collaborative storytelling that gets me jazzed about Asheron's 
    Call. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It definitely isn't science, and I don't know 
    if it's art or just a bunch of happy accidents -- but it's definitely a 
    learning process. Issues we consider important to address as events develop:
    </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How do we find more ways to involve large 
      groups in an event? Our “Fire in the Sky” Beta-event encouraged large 
      groups to scour the landscape in search of fragments of a prophecy; how 
      can we extend that sort of behavior to encompass entire allegiances?
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How do we balance specific quests in 
      specific locations with new content (items, clothing, spells, new 
      monster-encounters) for everyone? The former is great for communicating 
      stories, but the latter affects more players across the board. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How do we balance events to include both 
      lower-level and higher-level adventurers? Frore, while compelling, focused 
      solely on high-level players; we want the “meat” of future events to suit 
      a wider array of levels. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">How do we prevent the handful of new 
      quests, chests and dungeons we create for the latest event from turning 
      into feasts of crowding and camping. Frore tried some new tricks to manage 
      crowding; we are still searching for the best possible solutions. </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we get the hang of it, and learn just what 
    sorts of stories we can bring you into, look for adventures to become ever 
    more compelling. We're searching for ways to weave players into stories in 
    ways you might not expect, and to turn your decisions in these stories into 
    something more meaningful and affecting than just killing a monster or 
    opening a chest. The roles you take on in these adventures should make you 
    feel something more than just the thrill of battle, the pleasure of reading 
    a good story, or the pride of “having gotten there first.” When we achieve 
    that level of emotional involvement, then we'll really have something.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the meantime, if Bael'Zharon comes 
    calling, don't be <i>too </i>afraid. ;) </font></p>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Ongoing Game Balance </b></span>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Not one to simply fill my personal soapbox with well-intentioned rants, I 
    should note that in addition to events, efforts continue to address the 
    ongoing balance of the game. The Build Notes posted elsewhere summarize the 
    changes in our January update; here are issues being reviewed for future 
    updates: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Melee Balance: </b>We recognize that 
      warriors have a harder time doing as much damage as archers or mages of 
      similar level. We are looking carefully at how we might keep warriors 
      competitive with other players, and are focusing on ways to make warriors 
      more powerful than they are now. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>High-Level Magic and Magic Defense: </b>
      As players grow in level, it's highlighting a potential imbalance between 
      the highest levels of spellcasting, and the ability to defend against 
      them. We are looking carefully at this aspect of magic-balance. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Treasure: </b>The increase in treasure 
      in this update is a gradual one, to ensure that we do not accidentally 
      flood the game with loot; we will be looking to see if additional 
      adjustments are needed in future updates. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Crowding and Portal Storms: </b>The 
      current system for generating portal-storms which disperse crowded areas 
      is often unfair in who it chooses to teleport; we are looking to make it 
      fairer. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Allegiance-Gatherings: </b>There will 
      always be limits on the size of crowds in AC, given the nature of its 
      technology and the Internet, but we are seeking ways to increase these 
      limits. We are looking into ways to allow larger groups to congregate 
      under certain circumstances or in certain areas, in order to help 
      allegiances organize and socialize. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Fellowships and Experience: </b>There 
      have been some observations that fellowships provide too little sharing of 
      XP between fellows. We're looking into those calculations, to see if we 
      can make them “share the wealth” a bit more fairly. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>“Camping”: </b>Right now, several 
      locations in the game provide “easy” adventuring for players. While we 
      agree that this is a fun way to play the game, it seems to be a bit too 
      unbalancing right now. We are considering ways to address camping while 
      retaining that style of gameplay for those who enjoy it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PK Balance: </b>When considering the 
      balance between warriors, archers and mages, we will also pay attention to 
      the related, but different, balance issues between these classes when the 
      characters are Player Killers. Any balance changes we do will attempt to 
      serve both purposes, improving the game for both NPK's and PK's. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Weapon Balance and Availability: </b>We 
      are still investigating how to ensure that players of all melee classes 
      are balanced with each other and have fair access to their weapons as 
      treasure. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Vagabonds: </b>Don't hit me! </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, every paragraph I write leaves me less 
    time to spend buffing my new archer. See you *round the Gharu'ndim lands!
