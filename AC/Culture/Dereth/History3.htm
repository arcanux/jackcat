      / Earth: June 2000</b></span><br>
      The Shadow Spires, which held ceaseless vigil over six towns since
      Wintersebb, began to move. Almost simultaneously, a wave of fierce
      portal-energy squalls slid down the length of the Direlands, bringing with
      them fiercer varieties of banderling, shreth, and other familiar
      creatures. The scholars of Hebian-to, Zaikhal, and Cragstone argued that
      these events were far too coincidental and had to be somehow related. It
      was previously known that the Spires could disturb portalspace, as portals
      had begun to appear at random on the landscape at the same time the Spires
      rose.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other creatures made their first appearance
      in Seedsow. Several powerful new types of undead skeletons began to rise
      from the sands and mires of the Direlands, and were seen to march to the
      northeast. As well, beautiful and deadly Empyrean diamond golem artifacts
      flooded out from long-abandoned storehouses.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately, the skilled bowyer, Yuan Hanzu,
      completed his research into replicating the old composite bows of Ispar
      with locally available materials. Archers and Crossbowmen across Dereth
      rejoiced, washed their hands often, and promptly joined the hoards of
      warriors and mages crowding into a number of newly discovered dungeons,
      heavily populated with Olthoi, Tuskers, Lugians, and other creatures.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most mysterious discovery of the month
      involved a number of unusual new war magic spells, previously unknown to
      the arts of Ispar. Wandering mages in the wilderness claimed that
      mysterious voices from the darkness offered them “long-dormant powers”
      if they attempted bizarre combinations of reagents. The source of these
      whispers was not discovered. While hard to learn and cast, the new spells,
      including rings and streaks, quickly spread by word of mouth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In local news, Yu Vuo-Ki and her sister
      Dansha-Ki moved to the north of the besieged town of Dryreach. Dansha, a
      rather inattentive woman, found herself captured by the roving Tumerok
      patrols that surrounded Dryreach, and had to be rescued by passing
      adventurers.</font>

      PY 11 / Earth: July 2000</b></span><br>
      The Shadow Spires continued their slow, imperturbable glide over the
      landscape, moving towards goals none could yet guess. Small groups of
      Shadows could still be found wandering the landscape, but their army, and
      their generals, remained sight unseen. Many began to wonder what the enemy
      was planning, if anything. Some optimists insisted that the dark ones had
      forgotten about this world, and gone on the bigger conquests elsewhere.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In north- and southwestern Osteth,
      residents were harried by an influx of creatures from the Direlands,
      driven east by the new, ferocious creatures that arrived in Seedsow. They
      were not the only creatures busy, however, as the massive Lugians
      discovered an ore with unique properties in the Linvak Mountains to the
      south. Soon they had opened three mines to recover this “Chorizite,”
      which appeared to be conventional metal that had somehow been rendered
      magically “dead,” and could not be affected by enchanters. When
      humanity discovered this marvelous material, the workers quickly found
      themselves overrun with eager would-be miners.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While the Lugian miners logged a staggering
      number of workplace accidents with their supervisors, Isparian sages found
      a variety of uses for Chorizite. Refined and forged, it could make weapons
      capable of piercing all protective enchantments to self and armor,
      although these weapons also shrugged off all manner of arcane enhancement.
      Ground, it could be used as a reagent by mages. As a result of Chorizite's
      unique properties, spells that used powdered Chorizite were able to dispel
      enchantments on their target. Distilled, the ore could be used in alchemy,
      allowing those skilled in this art to make drinkable potions that would
      dispel low-level enchantments.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile, one of the earliest defenders of
      Dereth was found to be not quite as dead as had been earlier assumed. The
      crypt of Mi Karu-Li, perhaps the most famous user of the Sho jitte weapon
      (some said he was the only user) was found empty. A note found nearby
      complained that he had been buried alive, and had gone off to complete his
      work. Explorers did later find Krau-Li, quite dead and half-decayed, but
      still maintaining that he was alive. In exchange for the return of one of
      his older jittes, he offered the reward of his newly developed
      “improved” jitte.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The smiths of Dereth also developed new
      weapons. Swordstaves and tridents came into use by spear users, as did
      spiked clubs for those who preferred the mace. Perhaps inspired by the
      ingenuity of humans, the mewling drudges “developed” wooden boards
      with nails stuck through them, and used them to poke innocent passersby.
      The giant Lugians took this “innovation” one step further. Young
      Lugian hooligans were soon to be found bashing one another with bigger
      boards, and bigger nails.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The biggest news of the month was the
      discovery of a passage to a heretofore-unknown island. A pair of undead
      heralds arrived in the Direlands, one in the northeast at the undead
      fortress of Chalicmere, and the other in the southeast, at a trio of sandy
      old crypts. In exchange for huge sums of money, these emissaries would
      cast a portal to the island of Aerlinthe, lying to the northeast of Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aerlinthe was an intensely volcanic island,
      with several peaks ringing a central lagoon. It seemed, in fact, that the
      island's nature had been the death of its original population long ago; a
      ruined port was discovered along the southeast shore, its inhabitants
      frozen into positions of horror by falling ash. Many fossilized undead
      skeletons still wandered the island, as did a host of bizarre new
      creatures. Coral golems lined the navigation channel into the lagoon.
      Tenuous vapor and plasma golems roamed the calderas of the volcanoes and
      the underground.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Intrepid adventurers, following
      instructions found on the bones of an undead Empyrean smith, managed to
      restart the old forge mechanisms built into the central mountain of
      Tenkarrdun. With a rumble that could be heard as far away as Ayan Baqur,
      the volcano came to life. Plumes of magma and a hoard of powerful
      blue-white fire elementals issued forth from the caldera of great
      Tenkarrdun. Those who visited the steaming crater found themselves
      overwhelmed and driven back.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the sighting of a great beast
      brought them back for more. The “Behemoth of Tenkarrdun,” a huge and
      powerful (though stupid) magma golem, had crawled up from the depths of
      the mountain to blister and squash all who dared approach its home. It
      was, eventually, overwhelmed and killed. Some say a mere duo managed to
      slay it, others insist that it took an assault of nearly a hundred to
      bring it down.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, Aerlinthe has managed to
      keep its remaining secrets for the time being. As Leafdawning drew to a
      close, the bulk of the invading force of fire elementals still held the
      caldera of Mount Tenkarrdun. While many searched unsuccessfully for some
      obscure, hidden method to end their reign, few seemed willing to directly
      challenge them in open combat. Perhaps this was due to the fierce
      conditions in the crater, or perhaps because what commanded the occupying
      forces could not easily be discerned.</font>
