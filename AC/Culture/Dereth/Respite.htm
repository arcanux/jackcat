    <h2><font size="2" face="Arial">From the Circle of Sages</font></h2>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">My sagacious colleagues,</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Our recent victories 
    against the Shadows have restored the world to a much more propitious 
    condition. The sun is no longer dimmed to a bloody hue, and the fearful 
    winged silhouette appears less often in the lightning. Perhaps most 
    importantly, Jaleh al-Thani succeeded in his quest to found a new Direlands 
    settlement. Now we must consolidate our gains. Jaleh's new town and the old 
    outpost of Fort Tethana are launching more sorties against the local 
    monsters. They need scholars as well as warriors. Already, Jaleh has 
    recruited many of the best minds in magic, alchemy, and metallurgy to his 
    service, and managed to improve the entire cataloging system for magic 
    formulae, in addition to producing a superior new sword and several types of 
    potions.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I am arranging an 
    expedition to seek Jaleh's fort. Until we know the purpose of the spires 
    floating over our towns, the goals of the Shadows, and the location of their 
    leaders, we must not rest from our studies. In the Direlands, we will have 
    the opportunity and resources to share many exciting ideas, not to mention 
    adventures. Consult with your acolytes and report back whether you will join 
    me and if so, when -- and from where -- we should set off.</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Yours truly,</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Aliester the Loquacious</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">After defeating the Shadows' 
    harrowing campaign in April, Dereth's heroes have earned a respite, but for 
    preparation, not idleness. Sometime in the first week of May, we continue 
    our monthly tradition of rolling out a major, game-evolving update, with 
    &quot;Heroes' Respite.&quot; A new Direlands outpost has been founded, blacksmiths 
    have created a superior new thrusting sword to exploit the weaknesses of 
    many common foes, mages have revamped the entire spell-reference system to 
    make magic easier and faster to access, alchemists have created new potions, 
    and the designers of Asheron's Call have added great new features, like 
    temporary attack immunity after resurrection, the ability to restore 
    accidentally deleted characters, a command to permanently block the messages 
    of bothersome players, and many other game refinements. Bring your improved 
    mages and blademasters and help us expand this new foothold in the Direlands!</font></p>

    <i><p><small><font face="Arial">Creatures of living shadow advanced by legions from the
    wilderness to blot humanity from Dereth, but the island's heroes checked the foe at every
    turn. In the Direlands, in Northern Osteth, and ultimately outside several major towns,
    each Shadow battalion moved to the telepathic will of a powerful Captain. In the ultimate
    confrontation, heroes followed the leaders of the invasion into the floating &quot;Shadow
    Spires,&quot; and some into a terrible new dungeon, where they destroyed a gemlike device
    of unknown purpose, the so-called Nexus crystal. Soon afterward, the invaders were quickly
    overcome, whether due to the destruction of the Crystal is not clear.</font></small></i><small><font face="Arial"> </font></small></p>
    <i><p><small><font face="Arial">No threat has yet replaced the Shadow invasion. But
    Dereth's champions remain vigilant. They have built a new town in the Direlands to support
    travelers and serve as a base for launching sorties against the local monsters. After much
    experimentation, weapon smiths have perfected a new class of thrusting sword -- the rapier
    -- which allows for unsurpassed piercing attacks. Alchemists have invented new potions.
    And spellcasters have consolidated years of research to make the referencing of spells far
    more efficient. A mood of quiet satisfaction and restfulness has replaced the horror of
    the Shadow assault; however, all but the most fatuous have kept in mind the leering
    apparition that appeared among storm clouds in the north, the Nexus Crystal, and the
    invisible presence that tested and interrogated selected heroes. The Heroes' Respite, they
    know, must be just that -- a temporary rest.</font></small></i><small><font face="Arial"> </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Continuing our commitment to bring you a major,
    world-impacting event every month, we introduce &quot;Heroes' Respite.&quot; Far from a
    time for idleness, the calm after the Shadow invasion is an opportunity to consolidate our
    hold on the Direlands and work on new skills. The developers have finished a long list of
    bug fixes; changed the spell UI; increased the loot to be found on monsters; introduced
    the rapier, a powerful thrusting sword; created new alchemical potions; and more. See the <a href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewscodestate1.asp">State of the Code </a>and

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are all the tiny little details of the 
    game update that was made on May 2, 2000. This list is culled from 
    &quot;check-in&quot; notes submitted by the game developers themselves. Things of 
    greatest note are listed first. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some changes are not in these build notes, 
    because that would spoil the fun of finding all that has been added or 
    changed! Some changes include major new things players can do to drive our 
    evolving story forward, which we won't entirely reveal here. As usual, the 
    Town Criers, Barkeeps, and Scribes may know the latest news! Also, the 
    trades of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and 
    abilities of items are not always detailed here. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Detailed Notes for builds 2331-2336: </font>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;&lt;Character&gt; has been saved&quot; message 
      no longer appears in the chat window. This was actually old beta code and 
      has been removed because the message was misleading. Actually, it did not 
      mean you'd been saved but that the servers had verified your location in 
      the world. Your characters are still &quot;check-pointed&quot; like this as normal, 
      and regular backups are still done to ensure that your characters are in 
      fact saved. No code has changed except for the removal of the message.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduced limited functionality that 
      allows you to restore characters that were accidentally deleted. Deleted 
      characters may be restored up to the hour time-limit as was previously 
      given to the temporary slot. However, not all attempted restorations are 
      guaranteed to be successful, and the deleted character will lose its 
      Allegiance information. Also you cannot restore a deleted character whose 
      name has been taken by another character. Until the other character is 
      deleted, the deleted character with that name cannot be restored. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The &quot;Are you sure?&quot; confirmation dialog 
      for character deletion now has a red font. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters are now invulnerable to all 
      attacks for a minute after they die. They forfeit this immunity if they 
      are teleported, cast a spell, or attack. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The squelch system has been overhauled. 
      Typing just <i>@squelch </i>or <i>@unsquelch </i>will list all the people 
      you have &quot;squelched&quot; -- that is, those characters whose chat you have 
      chosen to ignore. In addition, players' characters you have squelched will 
      remain squelched across logins (even after shutting down the client). Even 
      though you can squelch Non-Player Characters (such as shopkeepers), only 
      players are permanently squelched. You have a separate list for each of 
      your characters, not one for your whole Zone ID, so you will need to make 
      a new squelch list for each character you play. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Added multiple tabs to spell-cast panel -- 
      players can now sort their spells in nice, tabbed panels. You can switch 
      tabs in the Magic panel by pressing the &lt;insert&gt; and &lt;page up&gt; keys to 
      cycle through the five tabs. These are the same keys used to increase / 
      decrease attack power / accuracy in the Combat panel. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Magic Defense used to have as its base 
      value the sum of your Self and Focus, divided by 10. This made it hard to 
      get your Magic Defense as high as we'd like. So now it is divided by 7 
      instead of 10. As a result, every player's Magic Defense has gone up, and 
      raising your Focus or Self will help much more than before. However, this 
      only affects players, not monsters! Monsters will have the same effective 
      Magic Defense as before. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We had a problem with certain generous 
      chests that gave players an incentive to wait in long lines to get their 
      booty, usually at little or no risk. All you had to do was wait your turn. 
      This is not very heroic, and unfair to those players who want to get a 
      nice chest of loot but have better things to do than wait in a line for 
      hours. It also created lots of complaints about players who did not follow 
      the “etiquette” of how to wait their turn. Therefore, we made some 
      changes. The good news is that these chests will regenerate their treasure 
      much faster than before, so if you are waiting your turn, you will have to 
      wait much less time. The bad news is that the chests are locked, so just 
      waiting there won't do any good. The good news is that the keys to these 
      chests are now part of monster loot throughout the world. So go out and 
      fight powerful monsters anywhere you like, and if you are lucky, you may 
      end up with a key that will unlock any one of these wonderful chests. You 
      can then make it your quest to fight your way to such a chest and, without 
      having to wait in a line, open it up and enjoy your booty. Though players 
      who did not mind the wait are sure to be disappointed, we know that far 
      more players will be pleased by this change, as it rewards true 
      adventurers with mini-quests that yield great rewards. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Treasure generators (such as chests) will 
      now create new items even when they are partially emptied. This should 
      also fix the problems with generators that were failing completely. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed problem where putting containers in 
      inventory was causing the ground container window to open and stay that 
      way </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Fixed the movement of the spell-cast panel 
      so it works well with slow machines. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lesser celdon shadow girth encumbrance set 
      to 1625, per spec. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was also another subtle bug that got 
      fixed: AIs will no longer use self-targeted transfer spells to boost stats 
      that are already full (they were doing this check only for boost spells 
      before). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Perch eliminated. Some rock pillars still 
      had physics. Removed it months ago, but somehow it didn't get checked in. 
      People were using these as perches to plink Olthoi. Now, the objects have 
      no physics. No more perching! Fixed all instances of this that I could 
      find. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All swords now have a 50% variance instead 
      of 75%. Unf! This should really help the sword wielders. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Kicked up variance of the Olthoi Sword to 
      .5 (that wily Olthoi was hiding in a funny bunny directory). </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Eastham Tailor had a max buy price of 0 -- 
      set to 7500 now, per spec. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">You will not be able to see the level of a 
      PK player if you fail to successfully appraise him or her. The deception 
      skill therefore becomes much more useful to a PK. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We added an <i>@deaths </i>command that 
      prints out how many times your character has died. We thought players 
      would be curious to know this info. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Gain PP in Arcane Lore for successfully 
      reading scrolls. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Granite golem now has chance to drop 
      motes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lowered encumbrances and improved 
      elemental resistances of all pieces of Shadowhunter Armor. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hot kimchi mass and encumbrance swapped.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spell-cast panel didn't realize when you 
      deleted readied spell -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In some cases numbers were showing up 
      incorrectly and with &quot;:&quot; in them. This should be fixed now, using a better 
      formatting function. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monster loot improved for many creatures.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Monsters were camping out near a lifestone 
      southwest of Zaikhal. We removed the monsters from this area. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi Sword now looks like an Olthoi 
      Sword. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Road now goes right up to the Obsidian 
      Span on both sides. The artisans of Dereth decided that such a bridge 
      deserved a road and set to work! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Cows' and Aurochs' turn rates are now 
      increased. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lower levels of the Shoushi grotto are now 
      harder. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Samsur Library portal was the wrong color 
      -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Shreth Hive portal was the wrong color -- 
      fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Stone Cathedral portal was the wrong color 
      -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Dungeon Mei portal needed level 
      restrictions -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Dungeon Binar portal was the wrong color 
      -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Folthid Cellar portal needed level 
      restrictions -- fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed some generic gems located in the 
      Colier Mine. They were useless and cheap. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Trapped in the Sclavus Keep -- I placed a 
      button on the other side of an activated-only door. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Lockpick Ineptitude Self spells have a red 
      outline around the icon now. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Olthoi at the end of the Incunabula Vault 
      once again fall to the ground! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Empyrean Foundry -- activated door now 
      linked correctly. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mountain Fortress -- lanterns replaced 
      with candles. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Rabbits were defending each other. This 
      was a result of changes made during the spring event. They no longer 
      defend each other. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Removed a duplicate healer in Zaikhal. 
      Replaced the healer sign with a tailor sign because the healer is in the 
      other building up on the hill! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The gravitational constant of protein has 
      been changed; the weight of cooked foods has been dropped by 25 - 50%. 
      Also, rabbit carcasses no longer weigh as much as cow carcasses.</font></li>

      - </span></font><small><font face="Arial">May<span lang="en-us"> Edition</span></font></small></b></p>

    <a target="_blank" href="http://classic.zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewsspin8.asp">Zone</a></font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, it's been one heck of a month for us.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, as you all know, in the May update we 
    accidentally introduced the &quot;XP reduction code&quot; that we'd been testing for 
    the last three or four months (yup, some of our game-balancing tweaks go 
    through testing for that long!). While most of us at Turbine and MS felt 
    pretty comfortable with the effects of the change, there was a very vocal 
    group that had reservations -- so we pulled it. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a side note: this did not affect those who 
    perch and drain through walls in order to fight things that are reasonably 
    close to their ability. If you could kill it fast, no worries. The intention 
    was to prevent people from slaying things that are way too strong for them 
    by wearing them down over time with no risk. Also, this did not stop those 
    players from doing this, it just made it so that they didn't gain XP faster 
    than those players who do play at a risk, with all the hardship and struggle 
    that entails. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Does this mean that we won't introduce the 
    same &quot;fix&quot; in a future update? No. But it does mean that we need to look 
    closer at the objections that were brought up and address them. Both MS and 
    Turbine have to give every little thing in each update a full vote of 
    confidence before we prop it to the live worlds. That involves design, test, 
    art, and our tech guys all signing off on each item. As much as we strive to 
    always &quot;give&quot; you something, rather than &quot;take away,&quot; all of our decisions 
    are based on two basic principles: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Is it good for the long-term health of AC?
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Will everyone hate us if we make this 
    change? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Without a doubt, the highest priority goes to 
    question #1. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We rationalized that by reducing the XP 
    granted to people using exploits in the game, we were, in a sense, rewarding 
    those who play heroically. Should the guy cowering behind a door and 
    attacking a monster that is levels beyond his abilities get the same reward 
    as the valiant hero who bravely charges in? Legends tell us of great 
    warriors and magicians who stood toe-to-toe with monsters to do battle . . . 
    Little is written about cowards who slew the dragons without any personal 
    risk. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This patch was intended to reward the heroes 
    in each of us -- for taking the risk to achieve the greater reward. I hope 
    that if/when we do reintroduce the exploit hole, you'll take it in the 
    spirit it was intended. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In other, unrelated news, a group of us got a 
    chance to attend the E3 expo in Los Angeles last week. While it was a busy 
    trade show for us, I have to note two highlights for you. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, I'm proud to say that Asheron's Call 
    won the AIAS (Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences -- our “Academy 
    Awards”) award for Best Computer Adventure/RPG game of the year! We thought 
    that the odds of us winning this award were slim at best, and when they 
    announced the winner, we were in shock as we took to the stage to accept it.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While a few of us were at the awards show, a 
    larger group of Turbinites were out having dinner with one of our fansites. 
    A quick cell phone call across town, and they heard the news at the same 
    time as the Turbine folks dining with them. Needless to say, there were a 
    lot of high fives and cheers passed around the table that night. (So much so 
    that the waitress asked to get into E3 so she could see what the hubbub was

    Hopefully we can get together more often in the future. Thank you. </font>

    got a lot of new cool stuff coming up in June that should please many of

    to address something that is on most people's minds I am sure:<span lang="en-us">
    </span>We know that there is something affecting the game play during peak 
    hours and in certain areas that is not internet connectivity/router related.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>This is our number one priority to address right now and we hope to 
    have it resolved soon.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Watch the State of the Code 
    for more details as we progress on the issue.<span lang="en-us"> </span>
    Thanks for your patience!<span lang="en-us"> </span>With that said, I would 
    like to introduce the Co-Lead Designer of Asheron's Call, Eri Izawa! Take it

    rei@Turbine&gt; First of all, thanks for coming! I have some things I'd like to 
    explain about how we answer your questions.<span lang="en-us"> </span>To 
    give you an idea of our schedule, we are already hard at work on the June 
    event. So we can with some confidence answer questions about that material 
    (though we won't give away all the secrets ;-).<span lang="en-us"> </span>
    That said, we usually cannot give you concrete dates or feature details for 
    anything new beyond one or two months out.<span lang="en-us"> </span>This is 
    because of many factors, including the experimental nature of events, 
    schedule changes, and the fact that something that looks simple may turn out 
    to be very complicated or even impossible!<span lang="en-us"> </span>In 
    other words, promising specifics for many of your suggestions would be 
    premature. We don't like promising things we might not be able to deliver.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Also, because we have so much planned, new requests on the boards or 
    from here may not be implemented til some time after the suggestion is made.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>But I want to assure you that we are listening! The spellcasting UI 
    changes happened in large part because of your suggestions at a chat much 
    like this one some months ago.<span lang="en-us"> </span>Again, thanks for 
    coming!<span lang="en-us"> </span>Done.<br>

    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Darroth, do you have a question for the team?<br>
    <br>
    +MrQuazarr@Zone&gt; Hi Leviathen.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Leviathen1&gt; Speaking as a high level Sword user I feel that melee *can* 
    be quite powerful, However I also feel that both life, item, and eventually 
    creature is needed to acheve this power....<br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; hi<br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; I understand Turbine's stance of not wanting to promote flavor 
    of the week charecters, and thus not allowing skill sellback.<br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; But I also feel that those of us that trained an attack kill 
    other than our heritage skill should be allowed to untrain our unused 
    unwanted heritage melee skill, since for many this would be<br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; the difference between getting a skill at 35 instead of 55. 
    Which turbine dev's do we need to begin to send things to in the name of the 
    fund to untrain our useless heritage skills? [GA]<br>
    <br>
    Leviathen1&gt; /me waves hi<br>
    </b><br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; One comment is that the heritage skills are freebie bonuses ... 
    though I understand they may not feel that way.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; Your actual question is to whom do you send these things to 
    ....<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; But you have shortcircuited the process, as we are listening 
    here &amp; now.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; We will take your suggestions and seriously consider them.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; The skill &quot;sell back&quot; idea has not been killed completely, but 
    it is not something being acted upon yet.<br>

    <b>__THE_WRATH__&gt; Hello, I gotta say this is a great game, just got some 
    concerns about mages and future updates for them.<br>
    <br>
    __THE_WRATH__&gt; I come before you today on behalf of all the disgruntled 
    mages upset with the tyranny that is against us. For many months now we have 
    been asking for an update for our kind, and have received nothing. The new 
    spellbar probably would have passified...<br>
    <br>
    __THE_WRATH__&gt; us if sword swingers had not only recieved a new type of 
    sword, but a new varience which makes them even more powerful, and to make 
    it worse, the accidental inclusion of the &quot;experimental code&quot; which is 
    obviously designed to discourage life mages,...<br>
    <br>
    __THE_WRATH__&gt; s yet another example of the contempt for our kind. We are 
    tired of hearing that &quot;our time will come soon&quot;. We want answers. Give us a 
    date. If our time is not until September, let us know, so we can do other 
    things until it is &quot;our time&quot;.<br>

    rei@Turbine&gt; I generally found that if one was significantly slower, one got 
    hit a lot more.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; A very fast run would allow the monster to perhaps get in a 
    swing or two, because the server figures you were near enough for that.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; (could allow... depends on where you were relatively)<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; There are many many different factors, and a lot of it is based 
    on perception and disagreements between what the client thinks and what the 
    server thinsk.<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; thinks even<br>
    <br>
    rei@Turbine&gt; That said, if there are signs of real problems, we will

    Izeman00&gt; Congrats on a great game, thanks for your hard work. Incubula / 
    Ob. Plains (during Umbris) were excellent additions to the game. They 
    provided a serious challenge to anyone from levels 30-60. After completing 
    monthly content, these type places make<br>
    <br>
    Izeman00&gt; the game worth playing. However, Incubula is showing strong signs 
    of overpopulation yielding a &quot;tunnels&quot; type situation, and the plains are 
    really hurting with the huge reduction in Umbris. I assume in terms of 
    adding complex content or quests<br>
    <br>
    Izeman00&gt; versus adding another Incubula-type dungeon or increasing the 
    density of monsters in remote direlands locations, the latter is easier. I 
    am challenging you to build a dungeon or area we can't beat. I thought

    it will be like LoD, picked clean....so, will you accept the challenge?</b><br>

    traggert&gt; #1 I would pay up to $30/mo for a premium server or a onetime say 
    $70 registration fee for acces to a premium server, is this a viable 
    solution? Or what does it take to get another server? I would sacrifice 
    content for 3-4 months for a new server!<br>
    <br>
    traggert&gt; #2 I love the Sturdy Iron Key solution, but heck if it didnt nerf 
    Lockpicking. But uber chests spawning parchment or fish with no loot over 
    level II? Rare drop item, long run to semi-hard chest, and I get fish?<br>
    <br>
    traggert&gt; #3 Love the XP code (I'm a life mage actually), PLEASE implement 
    it, I know its being tested, but it didnt fix the XP (5500xp) from the perch 
    in Incubula. Odds on this code, after modification making it in?<br>

    Evil_Elvis_&gt; However, there still exist some gameplay issues 6 months

    <b>Purrpetual&gt; Turbine has demonstrated a pattern of removing content from 
    AC that is tied to an event or is considered overpowered...<br>
    <br>
    Purrpetual&gt; Examples: Significant portions of Frore (including Tremblant's 
    Staff), Hoary Mattekars (and hence the robes), Gertarh's Dagger, and most 
    recently the Nexus Crystal (and hence the Nexus armor)...<br>
    <br>
    Purrpetual&gt; As most things that are removed are only obtainable by 
    high-level characters, this trend significantly encourages powerleveling 
    (Have to hurry up, lest we miss something when Turbine removes it from 
    Dereth forever)...<br>
    <br>
    Purrpetual&gt; Given the correlation between powerleveling and burnout, it 
    seems you're running the risk of losing customers at an increasing rate if 
    this continues...<br>

    <b>Janos_Lin&gt; Hello, umm I'd like to make an few comments before asking my 
    question, bear with me and I wont be long :)<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; First of all, being a cheifly an blademaster, rapiers are a nice 
    addition, but albeit, limited to really affecting a certain class of 
    monsters, and we already have piercing damage with all swords. Tests have 
    shown that the lowest setting does the most ov<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; does the most overall damage and that is precisely where the 
    piercing damage is. We don't really want rapiers dont see too many fencing 
    compeitions out there.. what's next? Musteeker uniforms? :P What we REALLY 
    want is a sword that does BLUDGEONING damag<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; damage. And yes such swords do exist, they simply dont have an 
    edge, altough I cannot recall the name presently. Even a circular piece of 
    steel will do, akin to the wooden swords used in some karate classes, but 
    made of metal.<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; Secondly, More dunegons would be helpful, and we need some with 
    even more challenging higher lv monsters. Considering the general population 
    is getting well in its 30's and 40's most of the once elite dunegons are 
    becoming more and more camped.<br>
    </b><br>
    <b>Janos_Lin&gt; Thirdly, please raise the ground spawn quality in BDC, al 50 
    chainmail sleeves arent worth much my friends... value was only 500 or so.<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; Why did u make the greater shadow amuli so ugly... brown and gold 
    doesnt exactly rock my boat, how about sliver/blue or purple/gold or 
    something appealing, to go along with the great difficulty in obtaining the 
    armor, it should be something we're proud of<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; not my question tho...)<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; Anyways my question is, are you going to add more circles of 
    magic? The highest we can attain now is lv 6. and since lv 6 starts at 
    roughly 250 magic skill, that leaves 2 more possible circles. I think this 
    is necessary as more and more challenging higher<br>
    <br>
    Janos_Lin&gt; lv monsters will need to be added for the existing high lv 
    population. Highest I know of is lv 70 whom is none other than Mythrandia 
    herself. I also relaize this may be quite out of reach of most people's 
    skills but might still be possible at the same tim<br>

	OUR SAGA THUS FAR...</strong></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial">
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Having defeated the multi-stage campaign 
	of terrible Shadow legions, adventurers are now enjoying a respite from 
	invasion, but it's no time to rest. An expedition to the Direlands led by 
	Qadi Jaleh al Thani succeeded in holding a piece of ground near the western 
	shore long enough to found an outpost, which has quickly swelled with 
	reinforcements. Still unsure of the goals of the Shadows and the function of 
	the floating spire citadels, sages desperately flock to Jaleh's new 
	community, freely sharing their knowledge to promote breakthroughs in 
	metallurgy, alchemy, and magic so that all of humanity will be prepared for 
	the next supernatural threat. Meanwhile, warriors have been destroying 
	monsters near the outpost to maintain its fragile foothold in the hostile 
	environment, incidentally testing the products, both magical and mundane, of 
	the sages' research.<br>
	<br>
	With this new event, &quot;Heroes Respite,&quot; the developers introduce many long- 
	awaited refinements to the game, including temporary attack immunity upon 
	resurrection, the ability to restore deleted characters, a permanent squelch 
	switch to use on bothersome players, a great new spell UI, a new thrusting 
	sword, and more! Try out the improvements and aid the effort to tame the 
	Direlands. See you in Dereth!</p>
