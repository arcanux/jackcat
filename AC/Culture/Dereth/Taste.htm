      <p><img src="Taste/eyca05.gif" align="left" width="40" height="40"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>The Cragstone Librarian looked up from 
      her reading as a hooded stranger drew near. “Welcome to the Cragstone 
      Library,”she said, and then paused. Something about the stranger reminded 
      her of a good old book: carefully preserved pages brimming over with 
      fascinating and unpredictable stories. “Can I help you?”</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>She saw a smile flit across the other's 
      half-hidden features. Sho, perhaps? A gloved hand reached out and gently 
      placed a few dark, round objects next to her book.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“I found these in my travels,”came the 
      stranger's quiet voice. “Take them to a skilled cook who knows the recipes 
      of old Ispar. They may bring a touch of nostalgia to many . . . and now is 
      a good time for people to enjoy the peace.”The stranger stepped softly 
      back.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>The Librarian was about to reply, but 
      her eyes were drawn to the long, sheathed tachi at the stranger's side. 
      Like the one who wore it, the plain exterior of the sheath promised 
      something unusual within.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Noticing her glance, the stranger 
      chuckled. “I hardly use that these days; I travel with the wind, and the 
      wind tells me now is the time to relax and rest up -- unless, of course, 
      you're in North Osteth, where more creatures have arrived from the 
      Direlands. Even a few tumeroks.”The last word was said with a faint edge 
      of distaste as the stranger turned for the door.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“Won't you stay a while -- perhaps to 
      read?”called the Librarian, reluctant to see the other go.</i> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>“Perhaps another time,”the stranger 
      replied. “But you have reminded me: I was writing something for the 
      Library at Hebian-to. I should finish that before I again follow the winds 
      . . . alas, I am a slow writer, so who knows how long it will take?”There 
      came a chuckle of amusement, and then the stranger was gone.</i> </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fulfilling our commitment to bring players 
      a world-altering event each month, we'll soon be opening August's “<b>Taste 
      of Twilight</b>”! Although volcanoes still rumble and the Isle of 
      Aerlinthe beckons more heroes on to their doom, the remainder of Dereth 
      has come to experience a -- relatively -- quiet moment of peace and 
      prosperity. To celebrate, many a town has spread word of contests they 
      plan to host. Can such celebrations be proof of evil's demise? Or merely 
      of its hibernation . . . Heroes can expect a quiet August in Dereth, a 
      chance to rest, hone their skills, and enjoy the night skies; at the same 
      time, get ready for truly massive events just on the September horizon.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For now, even with celebrations at hand, 
      adventurers should still take heed: the monsters that used to inhabit the 
      Direlands before stronger invaders pushed them out continue their

      in the forests and mountains of the far north and south. </font></p>

      August 8, 2000</font></font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Fulfilling our commitment to bring players a
      world-altering event each month, we've opened August's “<b>Taste of
      Twilight</b>”. In Dereth, thieves are not the only profession most
      active at night; many a sage has been seen unpacking and dusting off long
      unused astronomy gear, setting careful watch upon the mysterious skies. <i>Strange
      doings</i>, they've remarked when asked what it is they're looking for . .
      . when they've bothered to remark at all. However, only such astronomers
      seem to be the most troubled these days. Monarchs' swift-footed scouts
      have returned, reporting that a quiet has fallen about the lands. No new
      creatures have yet been seen, no new dungeon portals have yet been found.
      Despite the fact of Dereth's ever-present dangers, lack of danger's rise
      seems cause indeed for celebration; word has already begun to spread of
      contests to mark the occasion. While astronomers go about their hobby at
      night, by day others practice an equally ancient art -- that of cooking.
      With new recipes being developed, there is fear that while Dereth's heroes
      gorge themselves on the peace of these times, they may prove themselves
      unfit for future battle! </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And while some have taken to polishing
      their cookware, still others practice the polishing of their words.
      Peaceful times this month, it seems, have fostered a true renaissance of
      skill. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At yet, can it be truly said that all is
      well? While rest may be taken in August, there can be no doubt that evil
      does not sleep long. And what of that -- of no new dungeons, no new
      quests? <i>Sheer falsehood</i>, certain heroes mutter. <i>New tunnels have
      indeed opened in the ground . . . where corpses will stack at the hands of
      the dead already there</i>. Although unwilling to disclose this supposed
      dungeon's location, one hero gave vague reference to a “mark of three
      towers”. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And then, where is it the killers travel,
      those men and women wearing the red sash of their particular philosophy?
      To places where their philosophy can be acted out against one another,
      says the rumor. Some have proven bold enough to ask them where they go, if
      it's to this rumored dungeon. The only reply the killers give: <i><b>Arena</b></i>. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During this restful renaissance, skilled
      craftsmen have improved and added to the wares of Dereth. Adventurers,
      long since complaining of bruised toes and weary feet, have begun to sport
      new armored boots. And other craftsmen, skilled both in armor and in
      magic, have worked to improve entire suits -- shadowhunter suits -- of
      armor. Armor that will soon be needed, desperately. Prepare yourselves
      now, for August is but a prequel to even more exciting things planned for
      September; in one month's time, expect several new quests, dungeons,
      entirely new species of creatures, and more! Look for the first preview
      article for the September event coming soon. For now, be sure to read the
      new <a href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewscodestate1.asp">State

      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Please note that the update this month 
        is less major than our previous monthly updates. That's because we are 
        hard at work on an amazing September event -- just part of making sure 
        we celebrate the one-year anniversary of Asheron's Call with a bang! For 
        more information, look for the September teaser article coming soon.

        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new dungeon quest for moderate-level 
        players has been introduced. What is it? Where is it? Do you think we'd 
        come right out and tell you? </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A few quests that have been around for a 
        while have been refurbished so they are more rewarding and easier for 
        groups to complete together. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The monsters that used to inhabit the 
        Direlands before stronger invaders pushed them out continue their 
        migration eastward. More powerful monsters have been sighted in the 
        forests and mountains of the far north and south. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Meanwhile, Aerlinthe's denizens have 
        mobilized in response to adventurers exploring there. Beware! </font>
        </li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of our newer high-level monsters 
        were a bit too tough, or not rewarding enough, to defeat. We are always 
        re-evaluating Dereth's creatures, and have made some positive changes. 
        Take another look at your old foes. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Our re-balancing of the Shadow Armor 
        continues. As promised, the armor crafters have regained some of their 
        former abilities, with surprising results. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to a previous bug, the Ravenous 
        Dagger required the Axe skill instead of Dagger to make. This is fixed: 
        all those with the Dagger skill should be able to get their dagger made 
        now. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Ground Chorizite powder can now be 
        freely exchanged. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Food has become more varied and useful. 
        New recipes are emerging, and in many cases food has become more 
        valuable, lighter in weight, and more powerful in effect. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New “arena” dungeons have been 
        introduced for those who want to play “Gladiator”. Of course death in 
        these arenas still hurts as much as death outside them! </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Vendors sell alchemical items (such as 
        alembic) only one at a time by default, to prevent accidental 
        over-purchase. However, you can use the quantity slider to buy up to 50 
        in one transaction. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some bowyers were not selling bolt 
        shafts for quarrel making. This was a problem for crossbow players and 
        has been fixed. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Branith's Staff missed out on last 
        month's mana-cost reduction. This has been fixed. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More wonders of the Empyrean are 
        revealed as new lifestones appear in several places. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New icons for lockpicks and potions 
        indicate their quality. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to an “ID rollover” we are doing 
        this month, examination values for objects have been re-randomized. You 
        may now be able to examine some objects you previously could not, and 
        vice versa. It should all balance out in the grand scheme of things.
        </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Steel-toed boots have been introduced. 
        Kick someone in the shin today! </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Some fixes were made to hopefully 
        eliminate the “voices from afar” bug. </font></li>

      or feature details for anything new that we're not pretty sure is going

      made. But I want to assure you that we are listening! Again, thanks for

      countryside at a time, or randomly following one of maybe twenty 
      pre-determined paths with waypoints. <br>

      Waffleboy&gt; Let the creature start at the north of the continent and work 
      it's way down, attacking those that it comes near to, but staying away 
      from towns and other populated areas. I don't think five monsters would 
      put too much of a strain on the servers.. <br>

      Waffleboy&gt; Have the mob spawn at one of 20 random points to prevent 
      camping, make it drop something worthwhile (quest piece?) to make hunting

      Crowley@turbine&gt; New backstory on the way soon. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; And we came up with some pretty clever ideas to give 
      characters more depth, though keeping track of player actions and having 
      monsters respond is a little tough for us, given the size of our team. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; It's something we've done in the past, like Lugians 
      developing anti-magic weapons, but it won't often happen in a month's 
      reaction time. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; Simply because of the way our scheduling works. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; But we'll keep working on it. <br>
      <br>
      Crowley@turbine&gt; Done (Rei has something to add I believe) <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; I think Davej covered most of it.... <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; Basically we'd like to put in some more story-quests and 
      develop some of the monsters more fully. <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; Also wanted to remind that content we put in can't be 
      world-specific. <br>

      <b>alleviate&gt; Q: Can you randomize dungeon entrance portals in direlands 
      with some signs in a big perimeter around it? (Like small portal storms 
      indicating adventurer is approaching to a dungeon or parchments scattered 
      around it). I do not see any point of adventuring <br>
      <br>
      alleviate&gt; in direlands when you can find any point of interest with a 
      click in Acexplorer map. I also think you should have NPC scattered in

      point of interest with a click in Acexplorer ma <br>

      </b><br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; Do you mean make the portals randomized and take some signs 
      with them? <br>
      <br>
      <b>alleviate&gt; yes the entrance to dungeons be randomized with a time 
      period <br>
      </b><br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; We can make dungeon portals non-site-specific, and in fact 
      it'd be fun to do some day... having signs spawn in strategic places 
      around the portal, though, with useful directions, is not likely. <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; The other limitation is how to distribute the randomly 
      appearing portal... the geographic range might be quite broad. <br>
      <br>
      rei@Turbine&gt; It would also be very random in terms of where it appeared. 
      Still, it would be an interesting experiment. <br>

      the same. So I propose that a quest to die leather craftable good be made. 
      It could go like this… <br>
      <br>
      superkinder_egg&gt; a person would have to travel far and wide to obtain a 
      packet of color die. Then before giving a hide to the leather crafter 
      he/she would give the crafter a color packet. This would set your flag. 
      Then he/she would give the skin/hide and POW… <br>

      think this would add a lot of fun to the game and let a lot of use not 
      feel like we just look like everyone else. You could also eventually add 
      Greater or Magical color packets that could add… <br>
      <br>
      superkinder_egg&gt; a protection spell to the armor, be it a very low lvl

        <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shivering under a steady downpour, two 
		hungry heroes of Dereth sat camped around a fire, while a third stood 
		stirring a cooking pot. Hungry, gnashing teeth shone in the light.<span lang="en-us">
        </span>&nbsp;On 
		the beach of Northern Osteth, they had recently returned from an 
		expedition to nearby Aerlinthe Isle.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Hurry up, will ya?&quot; the seated life mage, or her belly, growled.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Just you wait! It takes time to prepare a dish. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Not like chomping raw 
		apples, you know.&quot; The vagabond cook sneezed directly into the pot; he'd 
		caught a cold in the rain.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Time -- and skill,&quot; the life mage retorted. 
        <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>&quot;Ever since you found those 
		brown beans, it's been nothing but sweets. Remember the hearty chocolate 
		beef noodles disaster?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		On the face of the other sitting hero, a gromnie-coated warrior, a 
		violet glow flared briefly. Another drudge had just been summoned to the 
		world.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I'll take care of it,&quot; the warrior muttered, rising to his feet. 
		Drawing his sword, he stumbled over to the water's edge, rudely hacking 
		down the intruding drudge with two quick strokes. Bending over, he 
		searched the corpse.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;This campsite isn't safe.&quot; The life mage shook her head. &quot;Anything?&quot; 
		she called over to the warrior.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Brimstone-cap mushrooms. Can we use 'em?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		The vagabond cook thought a moment. If the dish failed, they would just 
		be chomping raw apples. &quot;Well, let's find out. Throw 'em in.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		The warrior staggered back over, dropping three filthy mushrooms into 
		the pot. &quot;I'm so hungry, I could eat that dead drudge,&quot; he said. &quot;Hey -- 
		how come you never learned to cook those?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		True mysteries have occurred this month in Dereth, leading many to 
		question summer's supposed innocence. Adventurers, returning from their 
		quests on Aerlinthe Isle and at the Soul Fearing towers, have come 
		across certain heroes rolling, bloated, on the ground -- their bellies 
		filled with new chocolate treats. And healers have seen stranger wounds 
		than chocolate-induced upset stomachs and golem burns from the volcanic 
		caldera -- they've also noticed a rash of damaged, bloodied shins (not 
		to mention backsides), derived no doubt from the entrance of steel-toed 
		boots into the world. And then there are those nighttime stars streaking 
		across the celestial plane. Astronomers, having studied their portentous 
		journeys for quite some time now, have begun to frown and warn of 
		impending events.</font></p>

		</font></b>
		
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2">TASTE OF TWILIGHT<br>
		August's event has opened, and with it come festivities to mark the 
		occasion of summer. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Celebrating a brief moment of peace and prosperity, 
		heroes have begun a renaissance of skill -- with resulting contests 
		developing. The Quest for Chocolate pitted great cooks against one 
		another in a challenge of discovery; meanwhile, Dereth's poetic souls 
		looked to fill the libraries with their works of words. Of all 
		competitions, however, the most dangerous must surely have been those 
		duels fought in the depths of the new dungeon arenas.<br>
		<br>
		In addition, news has spread of numerous player-run events, including 
		Shiner's Morningthaw summer fashion contest, Mathonwy's Harvestgain/Arwic 
		meeting hall lottery, and Clan Bonsai's Leafcull Olympics! Great job 
		with the events, and we certainly look forward to seeing more in the 
		months to come.<br>
		<br>
		However, all has not been fun and games this month in Dereth. Valiant 
		efforts have been made in the Southern Dires to complete the latest Soul 
		Fearing quest -- heroes have staggered back, mumbling of a mark of three 
		towers guarded by the restless dead. In addition, progress has recently 
		been made in the Aerlinthe Isle quest. Assault groups, advancing further 
		than ever into the caldera, learned that the Behemoth of Tenkarrdun is 
		surely not the final villain to be faced. New treasures have also been 
		discovered there -- new infusions, whose effects are still being 
		investigated. Yet, with further victory gained on Aerlinthe, new 
		volcanoes have erupted, and with them such dire messages as this, in the 
		world where one brave hero won the day: &quot;As Cybelle smites the Hellfire, 
		the flame-creatures sigh, and begin to disappear back into the vents and 
		fumaroles they surfaced through. But, from the base of the mountain's 
		slopes, you hear the whisper of falling ash, and the clacking of 
		petrified bones...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Truly, the adventurers of Dereth would do wise to hone their skills now. 
		For, as has been rumored, great and momentous events loom on the 
		horizon. Already the first signs of which have been seen -- with the 
		advent of secure trading. And yet, if this is talked of openly, what 
		secrets are still kept hidden? For more information on August's event, 
		be sure to check out the official Roll-Out article<br>
		(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/tasterollout1.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/tasterollout1.asp</a>)

		STATE OF THE NETWORK<br>
		As part of this month's event, a new addition to the Web site has been 
		added -- the State of the Network. From time to time, maintenance work 
		unfortunately does require server downtime. We plan to use the State of 
		the Network to announce all downtimes we know will take place in the 
		near future, as well as to provide information on such server related 
		topics as ETA, portal storms, and the most dreaded beast of all -- lag. 
		Look for the State of the Network, along with the State of the Code, to 
		feature prominently on the News page:<br>

		MOST RECENT DEV CHAT<br>
		On August 16th, members of the Turbine group participated in the most 
		recent Developer's Chat. Having launched the &quot;Taste of Twilight&quot;, 
		Turbine took the time to answer questions on the newly revised world as 
		well as to address players' comments and concerns. This dev chat saw 
		some changes to the format, allowing developers a better chance to 
		respond to as many questions as possible. In order to solve the problem 
		of &quot;vanished&quot; audience members, the queue was cleared three hours prior 
		to the event. In addition, it was requested that members limit 
		themselves to only one question, to be stated first and then followed by 
		any comments. Please note that this format will be followed for all 
		future Dev Chats as well. To read the transcript, head over to:<br>

		CONTEST RESULTS<br>
		Results have been posted of those lucky souls winning the AMD giveaway 
		prizes. From July 28th to the 31st, players were chosen at random in the 
		game to receive prizes packages from AMD T-shirts, Gravis Xterminator 
		joysticks -- all the way to an AMD Mother Board and 800Mhz Processor! 
		Our congratulations to the winners, and our thanks as well to AMD and 
		Gravis for helping make this a successful contest. For the complete list 
		of winners, see:

		<br>
		LATEST TOP 10 LISTS<br>
		The latest Top 10 Lists are out! Recently, we polled various fan sites 
		to better determine what lists you want to see, and in response to poll 
		results, these most recent lists feature Dagger and Bow skills. Also, 
		since most heroes fell into the template of &quot;adventurer&quot;, we have 
		further added the &quot;Heritage Group&quot; category in an effort to provide as 
		much information as possible. While new list categories will continue to 
		be rotated in, and older lists archived (but not updated), one list -- 
		Veteran Ranks (displaying highest levels) -- will be kept current. Our 
		highest congratulations to Del Cabon, for reaching the unprecedented 
		heights of Level 100!<br>
		<br>
		All Top 10 Lists can be found at:<br>

		And recently, Ken Karl of the AC team took the time to answer a few 
		questions about the lists with the Crossroads of Dereth. His insights 
		can be found in the CoD news article &quot;Secrets of the Top 10&quot;, at:<br>

		THE ALLEGIANCE HALL<br>
		In recent days, several new monarchs have advanced to Rank 7 in their 
		respective pyramids. yet at the time of this writing, one monarch has 
		successfully ascended to the top of the list. Congratulations to 
		Skystreak Cloudrider, the first Rank 8 monarch in Dereth! Skystreak has 
		provided one of the most recent monarchy interviews; be sure to look for 
		the next interview from Zacantos of the Illuminati. At the moment, we 
		are attempting to arrange interviews with the latest monarchs; if you 
		are a monarch who has just been added to the list, look for an 
		invitation to arrange an interview in the days to come!<br>
		<br>
		Also, our most sincere thanks for remembering to send in those 
		screenshots with the monarch updates. As always, please be sure to send 
		updates at least once every two weeks, or you may be removed from the 
		list without notice.<br>
		<br>
		The Allegiance Hall now boasts well over 200 links to excellent 
		allegiance sites, organized by server world. Almost a dozen sites have 
		already been posted for the most recent world to open, Solclaim, and 
		we've just added our first Norwegian site: Klan Nidaros to Thistledown! 
		When submitting your allegiance site for review, please be sure that the

		PORTAL SPACED<br>
		My Five Minutes on Darktide: The following begins a hilarious account of 
		one adventurer's brave expedition. to the dark side. Written by Dr. 
		Sparky of Harvestgain, the following can be read in its entirety at 
		Asheron's Call Sage:
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.acsage.com/players/stories/five_minutes.htm">
		http://www.acsage.com/players/stories/five_minutes.htm</a><br>
		<br>
		&quot;Well, I had to try it. We all have had that little voice in the back of 
		our heads saying &quot;do it, try Darktide&quot;. So I figure why not. I have had 
		fun playing my assorted non-PK characters on Harvestgain. I have a basic 
		understanding of intricacies of the game, so I did it.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;No special thought given to template characters... I figured that this 
		was only an experiment anyway. Follow the generic blademaster default 
		with a few slight tweaks to give me a little more health, as I thought 
		that that might come in handy. I was wrong.&quot;<br>

		Taste of Twilight Falls Prey to Parody: Alas, not even the humble 
		writers of AC are safe! The following was posted the day our official 
		August event teaser went live, and can currently be found in its 
		entirety on the CoD news archives (<u>http://cod.xrgaming.net/11news.shtml</u>), 
		under &quot;Zone Teaser Parody&quot;:<br>
		<br>
		&quot;Fulfilling our commitment to bring players a world-altering event each 
		month, we'll soon be opening August's &quot;Taste of Twilight&quot;! &quot;Taste of 
		Twilight&quot; will provide what Dereth needs best, a chili cook-off! 
		Although volcanoes still rumble and the Isle of Aerlinthe beckons more 
		heroes on to their doom, (Doom! Doom! Doom! You're all doomed!) the 
		remainder of Dereth has come to experience a -- relatively -- quiet 
		moment of peace and prosperity. (Peace and prosperity brought to you by 
		the Asheron Party. Vote Asheron in 2000!) To celebrate, many a town has 
		spread word of contests they plan to host. Corn-shucking days in Yaraq! 
		The First Annual Drudge Tossing Contest in Mayoi! The Direlands 300 
		(Brought to you by Asheron's Armor Cleaner.)! Three-Legged Shreth Racing 
		in Lytlethorpe! Can such celebrations be proof of evil's demise? Or 
		merely of its inability to get its DSL connection working?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		STILL CALLING PROSPECTIVE ADVOCATES<br>
		If you own the game, currently play, and are interested in helping your 
		fellow adventurers as part of the Asheron's Call team, we'd like you to

		In order to dispel some of the confusion regarding the new arena 
		dungeons, please note that non-PK's will NOT become PK by entering the 
		arenas. This was never the intention, and for this reason we restricted 
		access to the arenas. However, we do understand that some misconception 
		about the arenas has nevertheless arisen, and we apologize for any 
		confusion that's been caused.<br>

		<br>
		RECENT QUESTS<br>
		As event logs have so far indicated, the Aerlinthe Isle quest has yet to 
		be fully completed; however, at the time of writing, recent efforts on 
		the island have managed to come closer than ever to solving the quest -- 
		including the Foundation of Wisdom's organization of a do-or-die 
		expedition, &quot;The Assault of Tenkarrdun&quot;. Best of luck with their 
		attempt, as well as to all heroes working to reach each quest's 
		conclusion! For news of recent events on Aerlinthe, you can read the 
		most current history of Dereth in the Story So Far, written by Turbine's 
		Chris L'etoile (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/ASHEhistory3.asp">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/ASHEhistory3.asp</a>).
