	(Sept. 3, 2004)</span></font></small></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This was not his home. He had been ordered to 
	T'Gru Kookur to wait and to watch for the phenomenon of the Eye to begin. 
	When it did, he was to send word to Reeshan, his liege. Then he was to walk 
	through the portal, round up Morgluuk and Torgluuk, and find a way to force 
	the eye open at T'Kuruul Reeshan. Reeshan would then enter the new portal 
	and find the way to bring the other Kukuur Masters to the world of the 
	Fiazhat Gods. There the Burun would complete their destinies and become the 
	rulers of both their own world and the world of these would-be usurpers. 
	That had been the plan.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But plans change.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Blood-stained and battered, the Guruk, 
	Mgrauleshk, stared his attackers down. Around him the fresh corpses of 
	fifteen Ruuk Savages floated in the shallow part of a fetid swamp, not 
	unlike those found on Bur. Already the feelun trees were spouting from 
	beneath the thick water and the scent of the mucor and koru mixed together 
	with the pungent scent of this world's swamps. Mgrauleshk watched Morgluuk 
	carefully. The Ruuk was of exceptional skill and possessed a keen intellect 
	that Mgrauleshk could not hope to match. But Mgrauleshk was far from an 
	typical Guruk. Now he put the mucor gift of his liege to good use, 
	calculating the Ruuk's next movement. Morgluuk had yet to enter the fray, 
	and the savages whose corpses littered the swamp around him began to return 
	to the fight. Fell magic ruled here and the Ruuk possessed it. Torgluuk was 
	the only shaman capable of such things.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Twenty savages descended as one upon 
	Mgrauleshk. They tore at his flesh with their claws, weapons and teeth in an 
	effort to kill the Guruk. He swatted a handful of the savages away with a 
	powerful blow; three struck the shallow mire and bounced along its surface 
	before coming to rest several feet away, motionless. Six of them tore at the 
	flesh on his back, spilling more blood and causing the giant to reel in 
	pain. He struggled to maintain his footing as five spears were shoved into 
	his gut and driven out his back. Fortune smiled grimly as two savages were 
	impaled on the spears as well. The remaining six savages beat his legs until 
	they collapsed under the strain of his weight. He let out a loud roar as he 
	collapsed onto the spear that now propped his broken body out of the swamp.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Morgluuk approached. The scent of the mucor 
	growing on his flesh was strong; it made him different -- stronger that most 
	other Ruuk and with a life much longer than any Burun save the Kukuur. 
	Mgrauleshk felt the bone sword tap his gullet and draw across it gently. A 
	new stream of blood began to pour from his ruined form. He would die at the 
	hands of the Ruuk. His mission would fail and Reeshan and the other masters 
	would be kept away from their destiny. The sword tapped his chin and lifted 
	his head upward. Mgrauleshk stared into the toothy grin as Morgluuk began to 
	speak.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Serve my brother and I. Give us your 
	allegiance and we shall return to Bur as rulers! We shall be the masters and 
	the Sleeping One shall gift us with the glory of this retribution.&quot; Morgluuk 
	finished and waited for Mgrauleshk's reply. Mgrauleshk could not win this 
	fight and death would serve no purpose for Reeshan and the other masters. He 
	croaked acceptance and saw the shamans emerge from the reeds bearing 
	ointment and spells of healing. Deep within his being Mgrauleshk knew that 
	he was the strongest Burun on this world. This fight had been staged to win 
	control over the Guruk. He had already failed his masters once. He would not 
	fail them again.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grevik Mar returned to Linvak Tukal with 
	haste. The council meeting had been both informative and disconcerting. The 
	Lugians of Linvak would soon need to make their role on the council felt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He passed the guards at the gate and began 
	his search for the spymaster in earnest. It was night; dark shadows danced 
	in every corner of the massive Lugian stronghold and finding K'rank would be 
	an effort—if he was even here.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Grevik made his way past the tavern, he 
	heard a terrible sound, like granite grinding against obsidian as a mine was 
	dug too deeply. It reverberated off of the stone walls and into Grevik's 
	bones. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">K'rank. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grevik walked through the doorway and 
	acknowledged Kilbrik, the tavern keeper.&nbsp; Kilbrik offered a weak smile while 
	plugging his ears as best he could.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;How long has he been asleep?&quot; Grevik asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;About an hour, the hoktor has driven off all 
	of my business tonight! I've thrown a few boulders at him but to no avail.&quot; 
	Kilbrik replied without a morsel of mirth in his words. &quot;Drunk, too! He 
	spent the night downing ale until he passed out. He kept going on about 
	losing one of his men and needing to send him properly to the Gods.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grevik nodded, told Kilbrik he would take 
	care of the situation and then walked to K'rank's side. He knelt beside the 
	Captain and hefted the slumbering Lugian upward. The Captain reacted 
	instinctively and struck Grevik hard across the jaw. K'rank stumbled away 
	from Grevik and stood there fuming in the flickering torchlight.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Hoktor! I was sleeping,&quot; K'rank spat.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;On the job,&quot; Grevik responded. &quot;Your man is 
	not dead. We'd know if he was.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">K'rank brought a hand to his head and rubbed 
	his scalp. &quot;I know that. But it was a great reason to drink.&quot; K'rank paused 
	and cocked his head to the left. &quot;You need a new hauberk, gray and gold are 
	for someone far beneath your station. I'll have one requisitioned at once.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Grevik shook his head. &quot;K'rank. We need 
	information from your men. Has there been any word?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Sit with me, Grevik. We shall talk of this.&quot; 
	He smiled and sat at the table, motioning for another ale.</font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Digging?&quot; Antius asked Jenavere.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Excavating is more the case.&quot; Hendac nodded 
	in affirmation of Jenavere's words. &quot;They have the top of the structure 
	unearthed and are working non-stop to find a way to breach the walls. The 
	little Burun seem to have the larger ones under their control. I am not 
	certain how that works out.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elysa slid forward in her chair and looked 
	over the area of the map that they surveyed. &quot;This spot is the destination 
	of the first portal, the one Rage Lao found, isn't it?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a moment of study they all agreed. 
	Jenavere spoke next. &quot;Do the Burun know where these temples lay?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It's a possibility,&quot; Antius answered, 
	tapping the map. &quot;The second portal that was found in those ancient 
	structures leads here.&quot; He put his finger on the map. &quot;It's landlocked, no 
	true access to a swamp, so they would likely have a hard time getting 
	there.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Antius, they've proven that they can change 
	the world by their very presence. Look at the Blackmire or the swamp in the 
	A'mun.&quot; Elysa slid her finger from the locations on the map. &quot;They'll find a 
	way if that is their next goal.&quot; There was a long, awkward pause. Then 
	Hendac slid his hand onto the table and placed his finger on a spot that 
	marked a solitary location, nearly inaccessible to uninitiated explorers.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No. Not yet, Hendac,&quot; Elysa spoke firmly. &quot;I 
	have faith that Ciandra and the Arcanum will discover how to craft the gem 
	we need to complete the weapons. I will not turn to her yet.&quot; She tapped the 
	location that the Burun and Renegades now inhabited. &quot;We need something, 
	anything that will give us an edge against these creatures. We need Kresovus' 
	men to come through. We need the information from his spies.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Somewhere K'rank took another swig of ale.</font></p>
	<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Many of this month's changes have already 
	been described in detail in the Letter to the Players. Here are some 
	additional topics that we'd like to discuss in detail.</font></i></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<font size="2" face="Arial">Rollback Recompense</font></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we'd previously announced, all characters 
	on Frostfell, Solclaim, Thistledown and Leafcull will have the opportunity 
	to obtain one free level's worth of experience this month as an apology for 
	a server outage in late July. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the August 31st server outage affecting 
	the other five worlds, we have decided that the free level will be for all 
	characters on all worlds.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting today, each of your characters on 
	all nine game worlds will have the opportunity to obtain one free level's 
	worth of experience. Please note that if this XP award is not claimed before 
	the October event, it will be lost.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<font size="2" face="Arial">Salvage and the Crafting Confirmation</font></div>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since the introduction of the Crafting 
	Confirmation dialog box, we've seen several reports from players who claim 
	that they failed their crafting interaction despite the crafting 
	confirmation dialog claiming they had 100% chance of success. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We've investigated the code thoroughly and 
	have found no bugs that could cause this, we've even added additional 
	logging that will trigger if this occurs – and it hasn't. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">One possibility is that folks who are 
	tinkering and have the Crafting Confirmation option turned <i>off</i> are 
	seeing the message, &quot;Are you sure you want to apply the Salvaged [Material] 
	(100) to the [Item]? The [Item] may be destroyed,&quot; and mistaking the (100) 
	in the salvage bag name for a 100% chance of success. This could possibly 
	account for some of the reports.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To prevent the possibility of such mistakes, 
	we are removing the (100) from the dialog that you see if you are tinkering 
	and have the Crafting Confirmation dialog turned off.</font></p>

	Welcome to the September Letter to the Players!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Last month in Dereth, we discovered more 
	details of the Burun-Renegade alliance, as well as the fact that the Burun 
	have plans of their own. The appearance of the hulking Guruk may have more 
	ominous implications than we first thought... what is the idol in the 
	Direland swamps supposed to represent? </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">High Queen Elysa’s representatives are 
	investigating, and we have received valuable information from our unexpected 
	Mosswart allies, but will it be enough? Are the Burun too entrenched in 
	Dereth to be defeated?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we ponder that question, we’d like to take 
	a moment to say thanks!</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">Turbine Nation</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We’d like to thank all of you who made 
	Turbine Nation 2004 such an amazing day. The turnout was fantastic – the 
	Asheron’s Call Player Luncheon sold out and both Asheron’s Call sessions 
	were standing-room-only. All of us on the Live and Throne of Destiny teams 
	had a great time and we hope you did too. </font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">Coming Soon</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>(These are items that we plan to implement 
	in the September event. Many of these items were mentioned in prior 
	articles. These changes are in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and 
	items that we’ll be introducing in the September event.)</i></font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Rollback Recompense</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we stated in the August Letter to the 
	Players, in September we will be allowing all characters on Frostfell, 
	Leafcull, Solclaim, and Thistledown to obtain one free level. At some point 
	during the event, simply go to Al-Arqas and speak to Jalina al-Hajj. She 
	will give each character the amount of experience required to get from the 
	current level to the next. For example, it takes approximately 5 million 
	experience points to get from level 49 to level 50. If I am level 49 when I 
	talk to Jalina, she will award me 5 million experience points, no matter how 
	close I am to reaching level 50. Characters who are level 126 will receive 
	165 million experience points.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do remind players that they will need to 
	do this sometime during the September event. It will be removed in the 
	October event.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we announced in our
	<a href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=261">Hardware Upgrades</a> 
	article, we have invested in a new database cluster to replace the backup 
	hardware that these worlds are currently using. We expect to be able to post 
	more information, including when we will be moving the worlds to the new 
	hardware, very soon.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">War Damage Improvements</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we wrote in previous articles, in 
	September we will be slightly increasing the damage on some War Magic 
	spells. Bolts and Arcs at levels 1 through 6 will have their damage 
	increased, as will Streaks at all levels. It is important to note that level 
	7 Bolts and Arcs are <i>not</i> being changed. </font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you can see, the largest increases are for 
	War Magic spells at the lower levels, where currently it is underpowered.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">PvP Missile Speed Increase</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a great deal of research, we’ve made a 
	change to the Weeping, Phantom and Hollow Bow, Crossbow and Atlatl that 
	should improve the effectiveness of these weapons in PK and PKL combat.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting in September, the flight speed of 
	projectiles (bolts, arrows and darts) fired from these weapons will be 
	increased by 80% to 100%. The increased flight speed will make it more 
	challenging – although not impossible – for players to physically dodge 
	incoming missile attacks from these weapons. The Missile Defense check does 
	not change in any way, nor does the maximum range on the weapons.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We’ll be watching the use of these weapons 
	very closely in September. Depending on their effectiveness, we are 
	considering giving players the ability to increase the flight speed on other 
	missile weapons.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Lifestone Sending Spell</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This spell, which players can learn through 
	quests introduced in August, was never intended to be added to the game. 
	However after players asked us not to remove it, we decided to leave it in. 
	In September this spell will change to self-targeted, and players can use it 
	as a faster alternative to the @lifestone command.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Content Revision: Three Crystals</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In September we’ll be revising the Fenmalain, 
	Caulnalain and Shendolain Crystal quests. Fenmalain is being revised for 
	characters around level 20, Caulnalain for level 40, and Shendolain for 
	level 60. The creatures and quest rewards are being revised accordingly, as 
	has been done with other older quests of late.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Content Revision: Al-Jalima</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we said in the August Rollout Article, we 
	chose to revise the town of Al-Jalima instead of Khayyaban as we’d 
	originally announced. The quests and content surrounding this town will be 
	revised and balanced for characters from levels 20 to 40.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Gromnie Weapons</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Several of the new Gromnie trophy weapons, 
	specifically the Brass Knuckles, Copper Cutlass, Sable Tooth Dirk and Ebon 
	Tooth Katar, were introduced with incorrect wield requirements. The numbers 
	on the wield requirements are correct, but currently they check against a 
	character’s buffed skill level as opposed to the base skill level. This is a 
	bug and is being fixed for September.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are currently wielding one of these 
	weapons and your base skill is lower than the number in the description, we 
	recommend that you unwield the weapon before logging off for the last time 
	before the September event. If you log in after September and are wielding a 
	weapon whose wield requirements you cannot meet, the game will attempt to 
	move this weapon to your main pack. If your main pack is full, the weapon 
	will drop to the ground.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Singularity Scepters and Quest Weapons</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After changing the scale of Biting Strike and 
	Crushing Blow in PvP, we have continued to closely watch these weapons and 
	listen to players’ feedback regarding them. After much investigation and 
	discussion, we have decided that these weapons are, unfortunately, 
	overpowered – particularly when used by very high-level characters against 
	Virindi. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In September we will be making the following 
	changes: All Singularity Scepters will have their Virindi Slayer quality 
	reduced by 22% and their Crushing Blow ability will be removed. The Biting 
	Strike ability on the Ultimate Singularity Scepters will be reduced by 6%. 
	As the standard Singularity Scepters and Bound Singularity Scepters do not 
	need as great a reduction as the Ultimates, their Biting Strike abilities 
	will be increased considerably to compensate for the lack of Crushing Blow. 
	The Biting Strike on the Ultimate Scepters will still be higher than that on 
	the standard and Bound Scepters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who have been watching carefully may 
	have noticed that we’ve been making a number of adjustments recently to the 
	damage on high-level quest weapons. You may be wondering, <i>Why all the 
	changes?</i> As was mentioned in a much earlier <b>In-Concept</b> article, 
	we are continuing to do preliminary work on higher wield-req melee weapons, 
	missile weapons and casters in loot. We don’t want our high-level quest 
	weapons to be immediately useless the month that these new weapons begin 
	dropping. But at the same time, we don’t want to make these quest weapons 
	the must-have always-best weapons for the time until the new loot weapons 
	appear. Thus there has been more balance “juggling” than usual.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So when are the new loot weapons coming? Our
	<i>very tentative</i> plans call for them to begin showing up in loot in the 
	December event. However these plans may very well change between now and 
	then.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">In Development</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>(These are the game changes that we are 
	working on for the October event. None of these items are guaranteed to be 
	added for October as scheduling and priorities can change. These changes are 
	in addition to the new quests, dungeons, and items that we’ll be introducing 
	in the October event. Your feedback on these topics is particularly 
	valuable.)</i></font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Salvaging Skill</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In October we are working on a new skill for 
	all characters – Salvaging. All existing characters would have this skill as 
	soon as they log in after the October event, and all new characters would 
	start with it. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When using an Ust to salvage items, the 
	Salvaging skill would be considered along with the Tinkering skills when 
	determining how much salvage the player receives. If Salvaging were higher 
	than all the player’s Tinkering skills, it would be used for the skill 
	check; otherwise the highest Tinkering skill would be used.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Other aspects of the skill – such as which 
	attributes, if any, it will be tied to – are still being worked on.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ust Improvements</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are working on improvements to the Ust to 
	allow players to salvage items of different material types all at once. For 
	example if you put an Ivory Tankard, a Brass Breastplate, and a Fire Opal 
	Ring into the ust and hit the Salvage button, you would receive an Ivory 
	bag, a Brass bag, and a Fire Opal bag.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One other aspect of usts that we are working 
	to change is the advantage to salvaging items one at a time. Currently, due 
	to the way the salvaging calculations work, it is often possible to get more 
	salvage by salvaging items one at a time; rather than all at once. This is a 
	time-consuming process, but many players salvage this way to maximize their 
	return. Once we’ve made these changes, you will get the larger amount even 
	if you salvage all the items at once.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Faster Missile Projectiles</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we mentioned above, based on the feedback 
	from the PvP Missile Weapon changes we are considering creating some method 
	for players to apply this improvement to loot weapons. As the September 
	event falls in the middle of our October development cycle, it is quite 
	likely that this may not be ready for the October event.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineSmall">
		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Gromnie Teeth Rewards</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the introduction of the 
	percentage-based Ash Tooth crafting reward, some players have used this and 
	the skill sellback quest as a way to “launder” experience into a non-craft 
	skill. The introduction of additional percentage-based rewards only 
	exacerbated this behavior. These percentage-based rewards were intended to 
	benefit tradeskill characters, not to benefit players who only train a trade 
	skill so that they can eventually move the experience into a combat skill.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In October, we are looking at setting a cap 
	for each of the percentage-based rewards. If your skill is greater than this 
	cap, you will receive a flat reward for the crafted item instead of a 
	percentage-based reward. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As “laundering” experience through these 
	quests is most effective for characters who have maxed or nearly maxed one 
	or more skills, we can set the cap at a point where it does not harm true 
	tradeskill characters. These characters will still be able to get their 
	skills up to a point where they have a high degree of success at even the 
	most difficult crafting interactions, but those who only use the tradeskills 
	as a means to move experience into other skills will find that it is no 
	longer as worthwhile.</font></p>
	<div class="headlineMedium">
		<b><font face="Arial">In Concept</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>(These are the game changes that we are 
	thinking about for November and beyond. We cannot guarantee when – or even

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are looking at revising and improving the 
	Siraluun trophy rewards in much the same way that the Gromnie trophy rewards 
	were revised in August. As part of our continuing goals of introducing more 
	crafting rewards, we are considering creating tradeskill quests and rewards 
	for Tinkering skills, tied to the Siraluun trophies.</font></p>

		<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Starter Town Portals</font></b></div>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We are continuing our work on making towns 
	more worthwhile for players to congregate in. We will be starting to pay 
	particular attention to the three starter towns of Shoushi, Yaraq and 
	Holtburg. The first step is to add additional portals to these towns to make 
	it easier for players to quickly travel from one to another. This will also 
	improve the experience for new players, allowing them to more easily see the 
	varied landscape of Dereth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There you have it – some of our plans for 
	September, October and beyond. Keep your eyes open for further information 
	on the Billing Migration, the database cluster upgrades, and the API that we 
	have in development. Articles on all of these are in the works and will be 
	posted on our website soon. We’ll also begin posting regular updates on the 
	status of Throne of Destiny as well as screenshots, concept art, and more! 
	It’s an exciting time to be an Asheron’s Call player!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">See you in Dereth!</font></p>

    (Sept. 7, 2004)</span></font></small><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hi 
	folks! In this article we'll be giving you the current status of the 
	Asheron's Call Billing Migration. In case this is the first you've heard of 
	it, we'll start with a quick summary.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As part of our purchase of the game from 
	Microsoft, Turbine is in the process of taking over all billing and 
	authentication services for the Asheron's Call franchise. Right now players 
	are billed by Microsoft and use Microsoft's services to log in to the game. 
	Once the migration is finished, you'll be dealing with Turbine for both of 
	these.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, when is this happening? Well, there are 
	actually two answers to that question. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Jessica wrote in her most recent
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=266">
	Transition Diary</a>, we're being very careful. To ensure that everything 
	gets done right, we've decided to delay the migration of existing accounts 
	until later this year. This gives us the time we need to make sure that the 
	migration goes as smoothly as possible, and to guarantee that your 
	characters and items will migrate with you safe and sound.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Second, Turbine's new billing system and 
	launchers are still on-schedule and will be ready soon. With that in mind, 
	we've decided to begin accepting new accounts on Turbine's billing system 
	before we begin migrating existing accounts. This will allow us to begin 
	using our new systems to sign up new customers without conflicting with our 
	work on the migration of existing accounts.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By breaking this process into two steps, 
	we're better able to focus on each piece. We hope that this will result in a 
	better new customer experience and a seamless migration for our existing 
	players.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We'll be posting more information on the 
	details of the new billing system, migration process, and more information 
	on dates within the next few weeks. For now we just wanted to let you know 
	that Turbine's billing system for new accounts is coming sooner than the 
	migration of existing accounts and why.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We're very excited about completing the 
	transition, and we appreciate your patience as we work to make it happen.
