		<img border="0" src="ToD/189.jpg" width="160" height="240" align="left">One 
		of my favorite parts about working as a game designer is creating 
		backstory and lore.&nbsp; It draws upon the same energies and skill sets as 
		one of my favorite pastimes, which is playing in or running tabletop 
		role-playing games.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So it was pretty nice to come on to the 
		Throne of Destiny team and have the opportunity to help create the 
		backstory for the Viamontians.&nbsp; When I started on Throne of Destiny, 
		Brandon &quot;meanbeard&quot; Salinas had already been working as a designer the 
		project for a few weeks, and had done a fair amount of work on the 
		recent events back on Ispar, plotting out what caused great numbers of 
		Viamontians to leave what seemed like a powerful position in their own 
		world to brave the unknown dangers that lay beyond the portals.&nbsp; &nbsp;He'd 
		also gone into laying the foundations of their early history.&nbsp; In a 
		series of conference calls with Allan &quot;Orion&quot; Maki and Jessica Mulligan, 
		we bounced ideas back and forth, came up with proposals, discussed them, 
		shot them down, approved or modified them.&nbsp; It was a pretty exciting and 
		stimulating time, and it felt good to get back into brainstorming and 
		creating a lore framework and history after a couple of years spent 
		mostly as a world designer. &nbsp;Before long we had worked out a solid lore 
		foundation, which would read like a good story and offered a lot of 
		quest hooks.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">We needed to build upon that foundation 
		when it came time to start writing some of the fiction and articles in 
		advance of the expansion pack, some of which have been posted already. 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of these articles dealt with the Viamontians and their place 
		on Ispar, before the portals started appearing in their lands.&nbsp; 
		Previously, the Viamontians had played a part in some fairly significant 
		events on Ispar, but the details had not been fleshed out.&nbsp; Oh, we knew 
		from some in-game Aluvian and Gharu'ndim lore that they conquered Aluvia 
		and established a puppet king over Gharu'n.&nbsp; We had the bare bones of a 
		timeline and a personality for them, but there was a great deal of 
		&quot;filling-in&quot; work to be done.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With only those few clues, writing out a 
		more complete Viamontian history took a lot of research, and the last 
		thing I wanted to do was to write something that contradicted something 
		already published.&nbsp; There is no centralized lore &quot;database&quot; at Turbine.&nbsp; 
		We mostly rely on scattered specs and an oral tradition (&quot;Hey Allan, 
		what's the deal with this character?&quot;) to keep track of lore.&nbsp; To dig up 
		all previous mentions of Viamontians in the history of Ispar, I 
		literally had to run an Agent Ransack search on the in-game writing 
		directory.&nbsp; I spent a couple of hours just reading through all the lore 
		I could, making notes, soaking it in and getting a feel for their 
		activities.&nbsp; Most of this is lore I had read before, but it's one thing 
		to pick up a few isolated events, and quite another to have a feel for 
		the whole of their narrative.&nbsp; Writing the Viamontian history was kind 
		of like navigating a long hike through the mountains with no trail to 
		follow – just a series of landmarks.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the landmarks established, I began 
		plotting a course from their founding history to their recent political 
		squabbles, drawing upon the discussions we'd had several months 
		previously.&nbsp; Obviously we knew that the Viamontians were a warlike 
		people, but how did they manage to conquer all those other nations?&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
		decided they were not a race of brute-force conquerors that overwhelmed 
		people with sheer physical strength or advantage of numbers.&nbsp; It's much 
		more interesting to have a race that conquers through boldness, 
		ruthlessness and cunning.&nbsp; How far did their conquest go?&nbsp; We decided 
		that they would be the ones to push over the tottering Roulean Empire, 
		which the Gharu'ndim had already critically weakened with their conquest 
		of Tirethas, the City of Lore.&nbsp; We also decided that, around the time of 
		the expansion launch, they would have been in the middle of another war 
		of conquest, but that their war would eventually fall apart as factions 
		within the Viamontians fell to infighting.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">People may notice that the expansion 
		content and lore have an underlying theme of &quot;blood.&quot;&nbsp; When I say blood, 
		I mean in two senses of the word: quite a lot of literal blood is 
		spilled in our lore, as wars and battles are fought; but the figurative 
		sense of blood, meaning lineage and family, comes up a lot too.&nbsp; This is 
		rooted in the founding history of Viamont, which is dependent upon 
		clan-based tribes, tied together through bonds of blood and hereditary 
		lines.&nbsp; The history of almost any nation in the real world can be traced 
		back to squabbling clans – family, after all, is a natural organizing 
		principle.&nbsp; By emphasizing the clannishness of the early Viamontians, we 
		set a good background for the divisions and blood feuds that we had 
		decided would be a central part of the new story – the rebellion of the 
		house of Bellennesse against the royal line.&nbsp; We just needed a way to 
		make the fractious clans into a nation unified enough to conquer half 
		the known world.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brandon had come up with the mythical 
		Viamontian founder Karlun.&nbsp; In that series of conference calls, we had 
		set him up as something of a Genghis Khan – the first to unite a 
		collection of independent clans and direct the fighting energy of an 
		entire people to a common goal.&nbsp; Karlun provided a great character upon 
		which to build.&nbsp; We decided some pretty juicy things about him that I 
		won't go into here, for fear of spoiling any further lore developments.&nbsp; 
		So Karlun provided a unifier for the clans and a way to establish a 
		&quot;royal&quot; bloodline, which promptly intermingled with the most prestigious 
		of the existing bloodlines, again carrying forth that theme of lineage 
		and descent.&nbsp; The Viamontians' emphasis on blood and lineage is also why 
		they refer to the other nations of Ispar as the &quot;Bloodless&quot; – not 
		benefiting from the mythical blood of Karlun.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As I fleshed out the details of the 
		history, I tried to seed it with elements from our quests and stories.&nbsp; 
		I placed emphasis on the names of important figures and families.&nbsp; I 
		think you will notice a few names from the history cropping up in future 
		stories and in the expansion quests.&nbsp; I thought it was important that 
		the names of quest NPCs and fiction characters feel like parts of a 
		long, living history, a history that is consistent and contains its own 
		internal logic.&nbsp; I think this is one of the best parts of AC's lore, and 
		I did my best to continue the tradition.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So in the writing of the Viamontian 
		history, I incorporated the lore decisions we'd made, left hooks for 
		current and future quest content, and emphasized the themes of blood and 
		family ties.&nbsp; I tried to make it a good story, but what I wanted to make 
		sure of above all was that there was a rich enough background for future 
		stories and quests to come from.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When I was done with a first draft, I 
		sent it out to Allan and Brandon for their feedback.&nbsp; After a few rounds 
		of feedback and revision, we had come up with a robust history, which I 
		hope will help with future lore-writing for Viamontians.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm pretty happy with the way Viamontian 
		history and lore turned out.&nbsp; It's especially nice that this is a result 
		we achieved through a liberal amount of idea-sharing and collaboration.</font></p>
