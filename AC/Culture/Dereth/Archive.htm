    three major human heritage groups have been transported here by means of portals, said to
    have been created by the renowned magical researcher Lord Asheron of Empyrea. It&#146;s a
    strange New World where monsters lurk and fortunes can be made. </font><font SIZE="2"><p><font face="Arial">There are many cities and many more underground passages to explore. Only
    hints and traces remain of the mighty Empyrean race that once occupied this island. By
    exploring their subterranean passageways you may discover something of the mystery of
    their life and disappearance, and learn why you and your fellow adventurers have come
    here, answering the call of Asheron himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Wherever you go there will be companions, adversaries, and strange,
    hostile creatures. Opportunities for combat are many, and magic is everywhere. Possibly
    the most extraordinary thing of all is that whoever dies while sojourning here is
    instantly restored to life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Many adventures await the traveler in Dereth. There are friends to
    be made, foes to be vanquished, fame and riches to be acquired. May good fortune and the
    blessing of Asheron await you on your journey here. </font></font><b><font SIZE="4"></p>

    </font><font SIZE="1"><b>BY CHRIS PIERSON, ERI IZAWA and THOMAS RAGAINI, JR.</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font></font><b><font SIZE="6"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" SIZE="6">I</font></b><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">n ancient
    times, the Empyrean flourished on the island now known as Dereth. A long-lived people of
    immense magical power, their civilization prospered for countless centuries. And yet,
    despite their rich culture and vast arcane knowledge, even this empire was doomed to end. </font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">However, no one expected the fall to come so swiftly. Few detailed
    records of the ensuing dark time have been uncovered, but it is clear that a magical
    experiment gone awry unleashed a new threat upon the island: the vicious, relentless
    Olthoi. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Little is known of the Olthoi's origins, but it is certain that they
    are not native to this world. Giant insects driven single-mindedly to expand their
    colonies, they spread like a pestilence across the land. The Empyrean's sorcery could not
    halt their advance, and those who were slow to retreat were slaughtered. Cities that had
    stood for millennia were cast into ruin. The catacombs where the Empyrean conducted their
    mystical experiments were overrun. The Olthoi would have exterminated them utterly, had it
    not been for the bravery and sacrifice of Asheron, one of the greatest Empyrean wizards. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Fragmentary chronicles make it clear that Asheron was exceptionally
    powerful, even for an Empyrean. With greatness comes hubris, however, and some records
    claim his magic was responsible for bringing the Olthoi to Dereth. Unable to stop the
    massacre, he spirited the surviving populace away from the world on the wings of magic,
    remaining behind to keep the Olthoi from following. When the others had fled, he retreated
    to his great tower, safe, even from the Olthoi. With Asheron in seclusion, twilight fell
    upon the Empyrean people, and the long night began. With no opposition left, the Olthoi
    completely overran Dereth, riddling the ground with their twisting, labyrinthine warrens. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">However, the tragedies that had befallen Dereth were not over. The
    same enchantments that brought the Olthoi to the island also summoned other races and
    beasts - among them humans. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Humans are no more native to Dereth than the Olthoi. They originally
    hailed from the world of Ispar, where many nations of humans thrive. Twenty-five years
    ago, in the human kingdom of Aluvia, men and women began to disappear without warning as
    the Empyrean's magic snatched them from their homeland only to deposit them later, stunned
    and confused, in the land of Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The first new humans died by the claws of the Olthoi soon after they
    arrived. In time, however, the Olthoi found a use for them other than prey. Unlike the
    Empyrean, whose wills could not be broken (same as other races like the Tumeroks, who were
    too savage to pacify) the humans could be used as slaves. The monsters still slew many,
    but now they also spared a few, spiriting them away to their subterranean lairs. Once
    enslaved, they forced the captives to care for their larvae or work in the deepest, most
    dangerous tunnels. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Some humans attempted to resist, but the Olthoi, who have no concept
    of mercy, slew them without hesitation. Even so, a few escaped to the surface, where they
    lived nomadic, fear-filled lives. In time, a leader emerged: Thorsten Cragstone, a tailor
    turned warrior who had a particular genius for evading the monsters. Thorsten harbored no
    illusions of being able to free his people, or bring down the Olthoi: the rebels' only
    goal was survival. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">That all changed with Elysa Strathelar. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Born a minor Aluvian noblewoman, Elysa lost everything when the
    mysterious magic drew her to Dereth. Captured by the Olthoi, she toiled for months, all
    the while planning her escape. When the time came, she made her break, and for a few days
    it looked as if she would evade her captors. However, the Olthoi finally tracked her down,
    cornering her in a desert canyon. As they were advancing, intent on ripping her limb from
    limb, Thorsten's band of rebels happened by. In the subsequent battle, several Olthoi were
    slain, giving Thorsten a chance to get close to Elysa and carry her to safety. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Thorsten and Elysa fled across the face of Dereth with the Olthoi in
    pursuit. Eventually, they found sanctuary in a vast, abandoned underground city. By this
    time most of Thorsten's men had fallen and only a handful remained. At first, Thorsten was
    content to remain in seclusion and reticent to strike at the Olthoi again, but Elysa - who
    had been a slave much longer - was determined to liberate her people. She searched the
    underground city, which had once belonged to the Empyrean, and found part of an ancient,
    charred manuscript in its deepest levels. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Elysa, who had always been good at deciphering languages, labored
    for weeks before finally succeeding in translating just enough to understand. The
    manuscript itself made reference to the fall of the Empyrean, and also told of Asheron's
    role in saving his people from the Olthoi. It also described his lost tower, as well as a
    mystical portal that led to it. After much discussion, Thorsten agreed to escort Elysa to
    the portal so she could travel to the tower and seek out Asheron. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">After an exhaustive search, they finally stumbled upon the portal.
    On the other side they emerged on a small island off Dereth's coast where a huge weathered
    tower stood, perched precariously on a looming mountaintop. They made their way up, but
    found, after much searching, that the tower had no entrance. Frustrated, Elysa shouted at
    the tower, berating Asheron for not helping her people. In the ensuing silence she
    suddenly...disappeared. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In the blink of an eye, she found herself inside the tower, summoned
    by Asheron's magic. The wizard himself was nowhere to be found. Alone, Elysa pressed
    forward, groping through the complex maze before finally reaching the Empyrean's inner
    sanctum. Sitting there quietly, as he had for years, was Asheron. Elysa, pushed well past
    any limits of self-control, filled the cavernous hall with pleas for help. Asheron, his
    countenance unchanging, only listened. Finally, he gave her two things to help in her
    quest: an elixir that would make a weapon lethal to the Olthoi when applied to the
    surface, and a single piece of advice on how to defeat the Olthoi: &quot;you must find
    their queen and slay her.&quot; With that, Asheron transported her back out of the tower
    to join a bewildered Thorsten on the mountaintop. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Armed with Asheron's elixir and insight, Elysa and Thorsten returned
    to the underground city. After some initial reluctance, Thorsten and his handful of
    warriors agreed to try the elixir in battle. They raided a small Olthoi nest, and though
    many warriors died in the attack, they wiped out the monsters and rescued nearly fifty
    slaves. This small victory was just the beginning of the humans' liberation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Over the next several years, Thorsten and Elysa concentrated on
    building an army of freed slaves. Each skirmish added a few dozen more warriors to the
    force, and armed with elixir-treated weapons, they set forth again and again. While
    Thorsten trained his army and led the raids, Elysa sought to divine where the Olthoi queen
    might be. At last, using records she found in the city's depths and information Thorsten
    brought back from the raids, she discerned a pattern to their nests, After careful study,
    she deduced the location of the queen's lair. The time for the final attack had come. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The army, which now numbered in the thousands, set forth with
    Thorsten and Elysa in the lead. Thorsten dispatched a brigade of his bravest warriors to
    serve as decoys and draw the Olthoi out of the vast nest, then led the rest into the
    tunnels, following Elysa's directions to the queen's sanctum. Taken by surprise, the
    Olthoi fell before the onslaught, but casualties among the humans were high and only a
    handful of warriors reached the end of the quest. In the lowest caverns, they found the
    queen at last. However, she wasn't alone as powerful Olthoi nobles guarded her. They
    attacked the humans with wild fury. Thorsten alone fought his way through, cutting down
    the nobles with his axe, only to reach the queen &#133; and fall, impaled upon her claws. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Elysa saw him die. Maddened by grief, she nocked an elixir-coated
    arrow and shot the queen through the eye, killing her. In that moment, the remaining
    Olthoi fell into disarray and the humans drove them to flight. The humans' liberation was
    at hand, but Elysa couldn't find it in her heart to rejoice. Taking Thorsten's body, she
    returned to the underground city and laid him to rest. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The ten years since the Olthoi queen's fall have been a time of
    growth and rebuilding. As the years passed, more and more humans were drawn to Dereth by
    Empyrean sorcery, including a growing number from the Gharu'ndim and Sho cultures as well
    as more Aluvians. They have built many towns on the eastern half of the island, Osteth,
    while the western half - known as the Direlands - remains a wild place, overrun with
    dangerous monsters. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">A year ago, on the anniversary of Thorsten's death, Elysa Strathelar
    disappeared. Despite numerous searches, she has not been seen since. Some suspect that she
    returned to Asheron's tower, but attempts to locate the tower have failed, and the
    manuscript naming the portal that led to it cannot be found. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Even now, as humans begin to prosper at last on Dereth, there is
    little peace. Monsters roam the island's hills, swamps, deserts and subterranean crypts.
    Small nests of Olthoi can still be found in places, and the supply of Asheron's elixir has
    long since run out. The humans' greatest fear is that another queen will surface, and the
    times of slavery and suffering will return. And other, darker rumors, have begun to
    spread: tales of darker forces, as old as the Empyrean themselves, have begun to stir deep
    in the bowels of the earth&#133;. </font></font></td>
