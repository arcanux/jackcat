      <img src="Lonely/img_swords.jpg" align="left" width="118" height="225"><font face="Arial" size="2">He huddles against the soot-blackened stone of
      the ruined aqueduct, surrounded by piles of neatly stacked tomes. Their
      deliverer floats away, cloak snapping in the late winter wind, accompanied
      by a hum that vibrates through air and teeth.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">You will do it, Ketnan. You will do it
      for our friends. You will do it.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Stop,” he whispers, clutching his
      head. It throbs in sympathy with the ceaseless, fading hum. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A ceaseless sea wind whistles around facets
      of living crystal. The crystal studies the veiled eye of the sun. More
      snow will fall today. The magic keeps the roofs clear. Still they do not
      come. The magic keeps the sconces lit, the fireplaces stoked, and the beds
      warm. Still they do not come. A few delicate pieces of white fluff fall
      from the heavens, settling on the piles around the patient crystal. The
      sea wind moans softly. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The man moans softly. A solitary,
      levitating gem throws gloomy syenite light across the stones of his cell.
      He stares at the gem, absorbing its feeble pulse, and hears the crush and
      roar of a frigid blue sea. He feels the salt spray sting his legs. A child
      laughs and crows, splashing awkwardly against the tide as she strains to
      catch the gulls. Warm arms encircle him from behind.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An otherworldly hum echoes down the
      corridor. He snaps his eyes away from the ocean light of the gem, and
      stands ready. He does not wipe the seawater from his cheeks. It will not
      be minded. The hum swells into the room. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hum surrounds us. A chorus beyond the
      veil of time. Beyond the suns. Beyond the dark. The tone has always been.
      It shall ever be. Constant and resounding in the space beyond. There it
      sings to us, unchanging. It soothes us. It is all.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The membrane muffles it. Mere anarchic
      noise drowns it out, pulls us from the crystalline surety. I miss it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The meat entity stands, leaking fluid from
      jelly surface organs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Poor thing. We shall sing to it. The song
      shall comfort it. And in the singing, I shall comfort ourselves. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next chapter in the unfolding saga of
      Asheron's Call is about to begin.</font>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unlike any other gaming experience, the
      world of Asheron's Call continues to evolve with each and every month.
      Following the defeat of the Hopeslayer, last month witnessed a breath of
      peace in Dereth -- or, at least, reversion to a more natural clime. Along
      with the winter winds came powerful new spells for war mages, and deadlier
      strikes for melee fighters. One can only wonder what additions -- and what
      dangers -- will be added when we open our February event, “<i>Lonely in
      the World</i>.”</font>

      <img src="Lonely/img_sword2.jpg" align="left" width="112" height="250"><font face="Arial" size="2">After the fall of the Hopeslayer, Dereth
      experienced a breath of peace. Or, at least, some reversion to the world's
      more natural clime. Yet now spectral lights have appeared in the nighttime
      skies, and what to make of these? Some guess they are the bonfires of war,
      warning of new and gathered enemies. After all, with the Hopeslayer
      defeated, another race must surely seek to fill his vacant seat of power.
      Others, however, suggest the lights are associated with the geomancy of
      the land; that, with the Hopeslayer's fall, the same natural forces giving
      rise to powerful War Magic continue to fluctuate, filling the world with
      further spells of heightened sorcery.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whatever the lights portend, true heroes do
      more than simply sit and ponder who, or what, might threaten next -- and
      the heroes of Dereth prove no different. Parties, gathered and
      provisioned, have prepared to set off on the most recent quests, drawn by
      the promise of journey's rewards.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To this end, one such party seeks to delve
      deeper than ever down the Mines of Despair (as the party's brazen leaders
      claim). Another has begun collecting strange items from across much of
      Dereth, each inscribed with an eight-pointed starburst shape overlaid on a
      swirling portal. And then there are those dungeon entrances half-buried in
      the desert sands. Entrances bearing the distinctive mark of Tumeroks.
      Whatever perils these quests surely promise, the rewards are certain to be
      as great. Potent Item Magic spells, armor uniquely suited to mages' needs,
      the loot of vanguard leaders -- even compelling lore awaits! A time for
      Dereth's heroes to both be tested well and to discover much. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Following is a list of the most interesting
      additions made to the game this update. However, please note that not all
      changes have been included -- that would spoil the fun of finding out
      everything that's been added or changed! As usual, though, the town
      criers, barkeeps, and scribes may know the latest news. Also, the trades
      of crafting and selling are always in flux, so changes to prices and
      abilities of items are not always listed here in their entirety.</font>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">&quot;For a moment, you feel as if a wee mousey 
    has scampered over your leg…&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Osiric shot up, awake, aware. The Gharu'ndim had been asleep, camping out in 
    the forests near Lake Lithane, when he'd felt… something.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>&nbsp;The hand of a 
    living Shadow reaching for his throat? <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>A Monouga's club raised against his 
    prone form? <br>
    <br>
    No. <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span>Osiric could see no one else about. He still camped alone. <br>
    <br>
    Not until several hours later, when the Gharu'ndim looked through his 
    belongings for a breakfast of grapes and cheese, did he find the &quot;pack toy.&quot;
    <br>
    <br>
    Osiric was a collector. Not one of those common collectors in town, buying 
    only Phyntos Wasp wing or Banderling scalp offered them; no, Osiric was more 
    ambitious in his pursuits. Of every variety of treasure Dereth had to offer, 
    Osiric had an example in his pack. A heart from every Golem. A spine from 
    every Armoredillo. Osiric owned every mask that had been created for the 
    autumn festival, and he still carried a jack-o'-lantern in his pack. <br>
    <br>
    And now this. Osiric carefully pulled away the gold foil, revealing the tiny 
    Pack Cow inside. A small figurine, apparently placed there by unseen 
    powers--powers who knew well the obsession of Osiric's heart. And now they 
    had chosen to reward him with this singularly unique item! <br>
    <br>
    His mission, to collect all of Dereth's treasures, Osiric now felt… 
    complete. After all, there surely couldn't be more varieties of such pack 
    toys to be had. Could there? </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="event"><b>LONELY in the WORLD<br>
    </b></a>Our latest monthly update, &quot;Lonely in the World,&quot; opened on February 
    16<sup>th</sup>!<span lang="en-us"> </span>&nbsp;While Bael'Zharon has fallen, and a monument erected to his 
    defeat, new trouble begins to stir in the lands of Dereth. Purple 
    luminescence has been observed in the nighttime skies… warning, perhaps, of 
    gathering dangers to soon be faced?&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Last month, strange fluctuations in the land's geomancy 
    led to greater feats of War Magic. As the fluctuations continue, even 
    further magic has been discovered. Certain mages gossip that, by trading in 
    their Level 6 scrolls, they have learned such spells as Infected Curse, 
    Inferno's Bane, and Swordsman Bait.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In addition to gaining new spells, the heroes of Dereth 
    have also been graced with splendid gifts--pack toys, ranging from the 
    common Pack Cow to the unusual Velveteen Olthoi. Appearing in our heroes' 
    main packs, such gifts came as randomly as they did mysteriously. For a 
    better look at the various selection of toys, head to:
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.goa.com/ss_packs.shtml">
    http://ac.goa.com/ss_packs.shtml</a>; or, try perusing the Crossroads of 
    Dereth's updated
    <a target="_blank" href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/compendium/trophies/">
    Trophies and Treasures</a> section.&nbsp;<O:P> </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Of course while some rewards appear as if by prop-day 
    magic, others must be earned on perilous quests. Consider those Tumerok-controlled 
    dungeons in the desert sands: dungeons that promise the mystic loot of 
    Vanguard Leaders. However, the path for another relic, the Thaumaturgic 
    Plate, has proven far more convoluted. To gain this valued armor, eclectic 
    items must be collected and deadly Golems faced. Information on these, and 
    other, quests can be found in the latest pages of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/proba.php3?jump_id=24">
    AC Tips</a>. Yet, while many venture after weapons or armor, for others the 
    greatest treasure remains compelling lore. And for this, Candeth Martime may 
    be thanked. Examples of his most recent works may be found at AC Stratics, 
    hosting &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://ac.stratics.com/content/lore/books/puppet_show.shtml">Puppet
