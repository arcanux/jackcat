    <p>&quot;High Priestess?&quot; The whisper-soft hiss echoed off the walls of the 
    earthen tunnel. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;What is it, Issk?&quot; Nuhmudira looked at her protégé, closing the book 
    she had been reading over her forefinger so as to not lose her place. She 
    was dressed in her midnight blue and white robes, overseeing the 
    construction of tunnels that stretched deep into the world. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;We have reached the inner chamber. So, too, have the virindi.&quot;&nbsp; Issk, a 
    chomu sclavus, bowed his head and spread his hood wide. The gesture was an 
    honorific offered only to the High Priestess of the faith. &quot;She who sings&quot; 
    was due this reverence, especially when the news her underling delivered was 
    disheartening. He awaited a response.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;Send your best warriors to deter their progress. I will sing for 
    assistance.&quot; She opened the book and watched as Issk rose to leave her 
    presence. She called after him. &quot;Issk, once warriors are in place, climb to 
    the surface and recruit others to our cause.&quot; In her left hand, a new, 
    simple-looking book appeared. &quot;Give them this book. It will explain our 
    cause more fully. The Isparians may question why I send you to speak to 
    them, but they must be made to know that Aerbax means ill with his goals.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Issk took the book, bowing his head and flourishing his hood once again.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****</p>
    <p>Alatar is going to have a fit. That was Antius' first thought as he 
    cleared the ridge and looked down into the valley. All of the existing maps 
    of the area would need to be changed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;The first terrified reports had come from the Sennon Valley and 
    Hand-on-Sword settlements. Almost overnight, trees and grass had died, 
    replaced by enormous mushrooms and other fungal growths. The whole area was 
    now a twisted wasteland, utterly alien in the pale moonlight.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;If we can't stop them, all of Dereth will look like this. It was a 
    sobering thought.&nbsp; He might have speculated further, had he not been frozen 
    by the chittering sound behind him. Antius turned slowly, looking up at the 
    blue-black armor, the burgundy eyes, the pincers poised to attack. One hand 
    reached into his pocket for two of the gems that Ciandra had prepared for 
    him, and he mentally thanked the Arcanum for their work. As he crushed the 
    stones and their magic exploded around him, he drew his sword in a flash and 
    lunged.</p>
    <p><br>
    *****<br>
    &quot;…capable of boiling the most corrosive of materials I have ever seen.&quot; Hiro 
    grumbled, crumbling a sprig of henbane into a bubbling concoction. &quot;I'll be, 
    it did work. Do you see that, Ciandra? Who would have ever thought?&quot;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Ciandra smiled and turned back to her class. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;With the discovery of aqua vitae, we have ushered in a new era for 
    alchemy on Dereth. I will be collating the notes for this latest find and 
    distributing them as I can. Please, remain vigilant in your research and 
    remember to turn in your findings to either myself or Hiro.&quot; She dismissed 
    the class and pocketed the gem.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*****</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;Garsh has failed.&quot; Niarltah said across the large stone table. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;So too have your heroes.&quot; Muldaveus leaned forward, speaking directly 
    at the leader of the tumeroks. &quot;Our forces were routed despite being well 
    provisioned and prepared.&quot; He leaned back as the tumerok leader nodded in 
    agreement. &quot;The question now is, what do we do next?&quot;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;When I led the massacre at Holtburg, so many years ago, it was only 
    through tenacity and perseverance that I was able to bring my troops to 
    victory. Even then, one Isparian proved to be a difficult foe for many. I 
    have not forgotten those days.&quot; Niarltah paused. &quot;Redouble our efforts. We 
    have chosen our place for victory; winning at Fort Tethana will make that 
    battle all the easier. If we fail at Tethana, there are always other 
    options, newer options.&quot;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; the gray giant agreed, then drew in a quick breath. &quot;But what of 
    the olthoi?&quot;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;For the moment they are of little concern. The ona I sent to track the 
    whereabouts of the olthoi hives will return to us and warn us of how great 
    the threat is. Let us focus upon the task at hand, Muldaveus.&quot; </p>
    <p>Niarltah stood and walked across the room toward an enclave of great 
    tumerok and lugian warriors. Muldaveus rose and followed close behind.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***** &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Elysa stood on a balcony, unable to sleep.&nbsp; She saw nothing in the night 
    but stars–Alb'arel was behind her and Rez'arel had not yet risen.&nbsp; And yet 
    she knew that, somewhere in the night, Asheron was instructing his golems to 
    repair the damage done to his tower.&nbsp; Somewhere in the night, Antius scouted 
    the new hives on her command.&nbsp; Somewhere in the night, in the darkness...the 
    olthoi waited.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;She remembered the weight of the quiver on her shoulder, the feel of the 
    bow in her hand.&nbsp; She remembered the horror of the Queen's hive, over a 
    decade past now, remembered watching Thorsten die.&nbsp; She had thought that it 
    would be over, that her people would never face such a nightmare again.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;So naïve, so wrong!&nbsp; The olthoi were coming, and now she would have to 
    take her people into the darkness once again.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>*****<br>
    <br>
    A single claw reached over a shoulder and unfastened the mask; three 
    tentacles stretched out to drag along the corridor of the newly constructed 
    tunnel. A consul, independent entity Vincadi, made his way to where Aerbax 
    stood. As Aerbax watched Vincadi in the tunnels, the mirror spoke to him 
    from the energy source.</p>
    <p>&quot;Master Aerbax. Flesh being Nuhmudira has acquired the objective's 
    locality. The tunnels of the flesh beings fill with a force set to invade 
    our current position.&quot;</p>
    <p><em>It requires more power to make the shift to the Singularity. Collect 
    the specimen at any cost and fulfill your goal. You have progressed well. Do 
    not allow a failure now.</em></p>
    <p>&quot;Our progress astounds even those who cannot comprehend our undertaking. 
    See that the flesh beings are shackled. We will achieve our objective.&quot; The 
    claw replaced the mask and the tentacles retreated beneath his tattered 
    cloak. &quot;I will bring forth the fleshless eyes. Vincadi, recruit the flesh 
    beings to our cause and conduct your research, as well.&quot;</p>
    <p>Vincadi's mask tilted slightly. &quot;You believe that the meatbags will 
    assist us?&quot;</p>
    <p><em>Is it wise to rely upon flawed beings to accomplish your work?</em></p>
    <p>The questions came simultaneously and were parsed to different receptors. 
    His answer came swiftly and without difficulty, &quot;The 'meatbags' have proven 
    ever predictable and reliable in assisting a cause they know nothing of. 
    They will assist us, as they have before.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Excellent.&quot;</p>
    <p><em>Excellent.</em></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pain erupted in her mind as hundreds of her 
    children cried out in unison. The creature she hunted was nowhere to be 
    found. It hid in a structure that could not be entered. It called littler 
    creatures to serve it, to protect and defend it. They hurt her children.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They used poking weapons and weapons that 
    crushed, and they called upon the same light that it had used once before. 
    Then she began talking to other children, the children of her firstborn, and 
    she learned that these littler creatures had been hurting them for several 
    years. Anger flooded through her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She issued new commands to her children. Her 
    mind spread into theirs and she stirred. The diggers turned their attention 
    west, toward where the littler creatures lived. She could smell them. She 
    could feel them moving about on the surface. She summoned the builders and 
    her first children and their children. New hives needed to be constructed 
    and defended. Nests needed to be built to call her children, while she made 
    the ponderous climb to the surface. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Terror needed to make its presence felt in 
    these littler creatures. It—the tall one—needed to suffer as she now 
    suffered, knowing that a littler creature had slain one of her firstborn. It 
    had seen to that death; she could feel that much from the straining voices 
    of the children of the firstborn. It would suffer as it watched its children 
    die.</font></p>

    Dereth – from the renegade Tumeroks and Lugians besieging Fort Tethana, to 
    the deep holes beneath Martine’s Retreat dug by the minions of Aerbax, to 
    the terrifying invasion of Asheron’s Island by the Olthoi.&nbsp; No, this is not 
    a safe time to be a human in Dereth, and the dangers continue to multiply.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Most recently, the power that rests below Yanshi has stirred – and thus come 
    to the attention of two major powers, Nuhmudira and Aerbax.&nbsp; Both seek it 
    for their own purposes, and it has brought them into conflict with each 
    other.&nbsp; But this power is not easily harnessed, even by the likes of these 
    two.…</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While all of this rages on, some Derethians 
    are turning to older sources of power in the hopes that these may prove to 
    be more useful than previously thought.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Sword of Lost Light</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The August update includes a number of 
    changes to the quest for the Sword of Lost Light, one of the original 
    signature quests in the game.&nbsp; The basic flow of the quest has not changed, 
    but there are a number of changes to the swords themselves that deserve some 
    comment.&nbsp; For instance, it’s important to note that only new Swords of Lost 
    Light, obtained after the August update, will be significantly different.&nbsp; 
    Pre-existing swords are no longer attuned (which means they can be given and 
    hooked), but they just aren’t as good as the new swords.&nbsp; The new swords are 
    also not attuned, but infusing a new Sword of Lost Light not only improves 
    it, but it also causes the sword to be wieldable only by the player who 
    infused it. Note that the infusions themselves are still attuned. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both the new Sword of Lost Light and the new 
    Sword of Lost Hope have some other special properties, but you’ll have to 
    discover those yourself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>New Alchemy Effects</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Good news!&nbsp; The enterprising alchemists at 
    the Arcanum have discovered a new use for their skills.&nbsp; Starting with the 
    August update, alchemists will be able to craft gems that cast a beneficial 
    spell on the user.&nbsp; Gems can be created to cast the full suite of life magic 
    protections (including Armor), as well as Regeneration, Rejuvenation, and 
    Mana Renewal spells.&nbsp; The strength of the gems ranges from a level 3 spell 
    to a level 6 spell; experienced alchemists will find it fairly easy to 
    create the lower gems, but the higher gems will be challenging for all but 
    master alchemists.&nbsp; These alchemy gems can be sold or traded, but be warned 
    – one of the most important ingredients is not available in stores. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alchemists should visit the Arcanum 
    settlement near Xarabydun for more information. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>“Your movement disrupted healing!”</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some time ago, we countered an animation 
    exploit by enforcing a limit on how far a player could move during 
    spellcasting and healing.&nbsp; If you moved too far while attempting either of 
    these actions, you would get the message, “Your movement disrupted 
    spellcasting!” or “Your movement disrupted healing!” and the action would 
    fail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After listening to your feedback and 
    examining the system, we’ve made two small changes.&nbsp; First, Non-Player 
    Killers are no longer affected by this restriction at all.&nbsp; As the exploit 
    was primarily used during PK fights, we felt that the limit was unnecessary 
    in NPK play.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, we have increased the allowable 
    radius for Player Killers slightly.&nbsp; This should still prevent the exploit 
    while reducing some of the frustration that players feel when lag or other 
    issues cause them to fail their actions due to movement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Item Enchantment Changes</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting with the August update, we’ve made 
    two small changes to the way players use Item Enchantment – casting spells 
    on your opponent’s weapons, and casting spells on individual ammunition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Enchanting Wielded Objects</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the past, casting Blood Loather on an 
    enemy’s sword or Brittlemail on an enemy’s shield was quite easy.&nbsp; If the 
    item had no inherent magic resistance—and as long as you could target the 
    object and cast the spell—you didn’t have to worry about being resisted.&nbsp; 
    Unfortunately, this had the side effect of making high levels of Item 
    Enchantment skill less valuable than high levels of other magic schools, as 
    there was no resistance that you needed to overcome.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Starting this month, however, wielded objects 
    that do not have their own inherent magic resistance will now be able to 
    benefit from the Magic Defense of their wielder.&nbsp; This will only affect 
    negative spells cast by an outside agent, not beneficial spells or any 
    spells innate to the object.&nbsp; In addition, if an item is unenchantable, it 
    remains unenchantable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Enchanting Ammunition</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previously, it was possible to cast Item 
    Enchantment spells on a single arrow, bolt, or atlatl dart.&nbsp; This led to 
    situations where, with proper preparation, players could cause large amounts 
    of damage with single shots.&nbsp; This was unfortunately causing some 
    difficulties with balancing quest monsters, so starting with the August 
    update, ammunition is no longer a valid target for Item Enchantment spells.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Bugs Stomped</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We’re very pleased to announce that we’ve 
    tracked down and (we believe) fixed a number of long-standing bugs.&nbsp; 
    Although we would normally save this type of announcement for the Build 
    Notes, these particular bugs have caused us more than enough grief, and we 
    are very excited to see the end of them.</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Coordinates should no longer disappear 
      from below the radar when it is in the 3D part of the screen.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you start to open a corpse or 
      container, and then change your mind, you will no longer be forced to run 
      back to it the next time you go into combat mode.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes players would have difficulty 
      IDing an object – they would find that for some reason the game simply 
      wouldn’t display any details about the object.&nbsp; This could be fixed 
      temporarily by IDing a different object and then returning to the first.&nbsp; 
      We believe we have fixed this issue.&nbsp; (As a side effect of this fix, you 
      may notice the ID panel closing more frequently.&nbsp; For example if you ID an 
      object in a container and then close the container, the ID panel will now 
      close as well, although before it would sometimes remain open.)<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, you can also now ID objects 
      that are in packs even when the packs are in another container, such as 
      housing storage.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Renegade Bows and Crossbows</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As many of you know, the Renegade Bow and 
    Renegade Crossbow initially came into the game with incorrect wield 
    requirements.&nbsp; Our July hotfix adjusted these requirements, but if you had 
    wielded one of these weapons before the hotfix, it was possible to continue 
    wielding it even if you did not meet the new requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first time that you enter the game after 
    the August event, these weapons will check to make sure that you can 
    legitimately wield them.&nbsp; If you do not meet the wield requirements, the 
    weapon will be removed from your hand and a message will be displayed on 
    your screen.&nbsp; If you have room in your main pack, the weapon will be placed 
    there.&nbsp; If you do not have room in your main pack, however, the weapon will 
    drop on the ground in front of you.&nbsp; We suggest that if you are currently 
    wielding one of these weapons, and you no longer meet the wield 
    requirements, that you unwield the weapon now in order to avoid being 
    surprised after the update. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those are the most important updates for this 
    month.&nbsp; Of course, in addition to the changes mentioned here, you can expect 
    plenty of exciting new content and the continuation of our ongoing 
    storyline.&nbsp; See you in Dereth!</font><p>&nbsp;<hr width="65%">

    <font face="Arial" size="2">By srand</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over the past couple of months, the AC Live 
    team has spent some of our marginal free time discussing the notion of 'PK 
    Lite'. Although this feature has not been a high priority for us, we think 
    that this could be a fun addition to Asheron's Call. And at this point, we 
    believe that we have both a plan and the resources to get a simple form of 
    PK Lite into the game relatively soon. There are, however, a number of 
    limitations to our plan, and many decisions still to be made. So we'd like 
    your input on this matter. This article outlines our current plans and the 
    choices that we want your feedback on.</font></p>
    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">What Is PK Lite?</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">PK Lite is essentially PK with different 
    rules. You can think of it as an equivalent system to PK, but wholly 
    separate.<br>
    <br>
    PK stands for Player Killer - to be PK means that you are flagged as a 
    Player Killer. Any PK can attack any other PK at (almost) any time. Player 
    Killers have a lot of special rules - like how and when they can use portals 
    and spells, how jumping and movement works, and what happens to them when 
    they die. In addition, PKs cannot harm Non-Player Killers, and NPKs cannot 
    interfere with PK fights. For instance, an NPK cannot buff a PK player, 
    since that could interfere with a PK fight. <br>
    <br>
    PK Lite is very similar to PK in many ways. To be PKL means that you are 
    flagged as a 'Lite' Player Killer. Any PKL player can attack any other PKL 
    player, and all PKL players operate under special rules. However, those 
    special rules are different for PK Lite than they are for PK. (We'll discuss 
    the difference in the rules below.) The most important fact here is that, 
    like PKs, PKLs cannot harm Non-Player Killers, and NPKs cannot interfere 
    with PKLs. <br>
    <br>
    In fact, because PK Lite is a separate but equal system, the idea of 
    non-interference now goes even further. Player Killers cannot interfere with 
    PK Lite players, and PK Lite players cannot interfere with PKs. The 
    following charts outline which actions are permissible in each situation:</font></p>

    <h2><font face="Arial" size="2">What is PK Lite NOT?</font></h2>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As important as it is to understand what PK 
    Lite is, it is perhaps even more important to understand what PK Lite is 
    not. </font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">PK Lite is not a formalized system for 
      one-on-one or many-on-many dueling. Like PK, PK Lite is a free-for-all - 
      all PKLs can attack all other PKLs. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">PK Lite does not provide a secure system 
      for wagering on the outcome of fights. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">PK Lite does not include a system for 
      tracking number of kills, nor does it include any sort of ranking system, 
      nor trophies for kills.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All of these are features that we would one 
    day like to add to Asheron's Call - but they are not features that are 
    currently feasible. It's important to understand this, because after you've 
    read this article we would very much like for you to give us your thoughts 
    on PK Lite. We know that many of you have a great many brilliant ideas about 
    ways that this system can be expanded, but we would ask you to please 
    confine your comments to the outlines that we have laid out below. We know 
    that this system as we have outlined it is feasible for us to accomplish in 
    the near future, and we also know that most of the expansions on the system 
    that fans have shared with us over the past fours years are not feasible for 
    us right now. But even within this outline, there are still a large number 
    of decisions to be made. So please keep your immediate feedback focused on 
    what we can actually accomplish. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Why PK Lite?</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before we get into the details, let's discuss 
    one last topic: What is our goal for PK Lite? Why would we want to add this 
    feature to Asheron's Call?<br>
    <br>
    We believe that PK Lite can allow all sorts of players, even those who 
    normally don't enjoy Player Killing, to experience the excitement and 
    competition of player vs. player combat in a 'safe' context. We want PK Lite 
    to have all the exhilaration of PK, <br>
    without the more permanent side effects (like losing your stuff) that can 
    frustrate NPK players and keep them out of PK proper. The goal here is to 
    provide something fun for an allegiance to do on a Sunday afternoon, a party 
    game, a way for friends to test each other's mettle. We are not trying to 
    replace PK in any way - but we are trying to expand the appeal of direct 
    player vs. player combat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, what are these special rules for PK Lite, 
    and what decisions remain to be made?</font></p>
    <h3><font face="Arial" size="2">Becoming PK Lite</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In order to become a Player Killer, players 
    must find and use an Altar of Bael'Zharon. We could do something similar for 
    PK Lite, but we would prefer to make entering the PK Lite state very easy. 
    The goal here, after all, is to make PK Lite something fun for an allegiance 
    to do while hanging out at the mansion, not a 6-hour epic quest. So our 
    current plans call for a new command - perhaps @pklite or something similar 
    - that immediately changes your status from Non-Player Killer to PKL. It is 
    important to note that this command will not work for Player Killers. It 
    won't even work for Player Killers during that short period after they die 
    when they appear to be NPK. <br>
    <br>
    </font><b><font size="2" face="Arial">But what do you think? How should 
    players enter PK Lite?</font></p>
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By doing a real quest? </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By talking to an NPC in each town?
      </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By using a command? </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">In some other way?</font></b></li>
    </ul>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Leaving PK Lite</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly, we'd like to make leaving PK Lite 
    quick and easy as well. We do, however, need to avoid situations in which a 
    player attacks another and then immediately leaves PK Lite before the other 
    player can retaliate. There are a couple of possibilities here, but our two 
    favorites are: 1) a command that plays a long animation, similar to @lifestone, 
    during which you are vulnerable to attacks; and 2) a command that can only 
    be used when you have not been involved in a PK Lite battle for at least 20 
    seconds, similar to the way portaling works for PK players. <br>
    <br>
    In addition, logging out will always reset your status back to NPK. This 
    makes sense because PK Lite, unlike PK, is meant to be a temporary 
    condition. <br>
    <br>
    <b>How should players leave PK Lite?</b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By doing a real quest? </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By talking to an NPC in each town?
      </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">By using a command? </font></b></li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial" size="2">In some other way?</font></b></li>
    </ul>
    <b>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Should logging out while you are PKL set your 
    status back to NPK?</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    <br>
    </font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Death Penalties</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A PK Lite death is defined as when a PK Lite 
    player is killed and another PKL did at least 50% of the damage. No special 
    rules apply when a PKL dies to a monster (that is, when a monster does most 
    of the damage to the player), but when a player dies in a PKL death, then 
    the special rules kick in. These are the death rules that we are leaning 
    towards at this point:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The killer gets no experience for the 
      kill. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The victim does not accrue vitae. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The victim does not leave a corpse. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The victim does not drop any items. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The victim becomes NPK and stays that way 
      until they decide to use the @pklite command again.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Point #3 - leaving a corpse - is pretty negotiable. Not leaving a corpse is 
    a slight savings to the server, but leaving a corpse means that all your 
    friends can see who killed you, and point and laugh. <br>
    <br>
    <b>How do you feel about each of the death rules listed here? Are there 
    other death rules you like that we didn't include?</b><br>
    <br>
    The Recall Timer, Et Al</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Player Killers are subject to a number of 
    special limitations that don't affect Non-Player Killers. These include 
    things like the portal and recall timer - PKs can't portal for 20 seconds 
    after being involved in a PK battle - an extended logoff timer, additional 
    stamina penalties when they jump, and others. Should these limitations also 
    apply to PK Lite? In general, we think so - we'd like the PK Lite combat 
    experience to feel very similar to PK - but this is a question upon which we 
    would especially like your feedback.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Should PK limitations such as portal and recall timers also apply to PK 
    Lite?</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>An Important Note</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It's important to understand that the PK Lite 
    system has not yet been implemented. We really want to get your feedback on 
    PK Lite before we go any further with this. But this means that we need to 
    solicit your feedback well ahead of time - much earlier than we normally 
    discuss possible changes. In other words, don't expect PK Lite to magically 
    appear in the August update, because it can't possibly happen. We may be 
    able to incorporate PK Lite into the September update, but - no promises.

    <br>
    On Tuesday, August 26, we’re going to be taking care of a number of 
    exploits, including a duplication bug. We also want to tell you about an 
    exploit we fixed yesterday. In order:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Oversized Fellowships getting 100% XP each</b>: Thursday morning we were alerted 
    to the fact that there is a serious fellowship exploit that could be 
    performed to get a large number of people quite a lot of XP very quickly. We 
    were aware of the fact that some odd fellowship bugs existed, but had been 
    unable to reproduce them, and did not believe that they were detrimental to 
    the game This reported exploit, however, was apparently quite detrimental. 
    Once we had general steps to reproduce this reported exploit, we began to 
    investigate. <br>
    <br>
    We found two different bugs, which combined to make one big exploit. The 
    first bug is that people are able to fool the servers into thinking that 
    they are in a fellowship with more then 10 people. The second bug, which 
    made the first one a problem, was that when someone has more then 10 people 
    in a fellowship, everyone in the fellowship would get 100% of the XP. <br>
    <br>
    We immediately fixed the XP bug because that fix was simpler and destroyed 
    the exploit potential. In order get the fix to the live worlds before the 
    servers were brought back up, we only updated the server and not the 
    clients. This means that right now, anyone who manages to get into an 11+ 
    person fellowship will see 100% xp sharing on their fellowship panel, but 
    will not actually be distributing XP to anyone in the fellowship. We will be 
    fixing the other part of this, the bug that allows you to get into 11+ 
    person fellowships, with the next monthly update. <br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, feel free to waste your time taking snapshots of 50 person 
    fellowships, if you like.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Alchemy Crucible Bug</b>: Additionally, we found a problem with the new alchemy 
    crucible. The crucibles, when combined with potions, afford a new version 
    that represents the potion within the crucible. We've found that it is 
    possible to sell this object within the game, and have taken steps to ensure 
    that this will no longer be possible. As of the coming hot fix, crucibles in 
    any adjusted form will no longer be sellable.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The Duplication Bug</b>: This one is nastier and is going to require more 
    stringent measures, which is the reason for the hot fix on Tuesday. We know 
    what the bug is and we’ve reproduced it inhouse. It is your basic dupe bug, 
    allowing items to be duplicated and passed around or sold. I won’t go into 
    an explanation of the process; those who don’t know about it don’t need to 
    know, and those who do know about it – also known as “exploiters” and by 
    less savory terms – are already using it. What those latter people don’t 
    know is this: <br>
    <br>
    We’ve been keeping logs.<br>
    <br>
    We’re going through the logs and, sad to say, some accounts have contracted 
    the terminal version of the duping disease and there will soon be some 
    deaths in our little online family. Everyone knows that duping is wrong and 
    a violation of the Code of Conduct. In the past, the policy has been 
    lenient, endowing dupers with punishment as horrific as a 1 or 3 day ban and 
    similar Inquisition-like tortures. As of today, all that changes; the silk 
    gloves come off and the iron gauntlets go on. From now on, the punishment is 
    permanent and lasting.</font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <i><b>Be Warned: Anyone caught intentionally duping can and will be permanently 
    banned from the game.</b></i></font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There will be no reprieves, as happened in the past. A permanent ban for 
    duping means just that – permanent. For those who think they can get a 
    weekend of duping in before the hot fix goes live: read above about the 
    logs. If you think I will be reversing myself on this, as others have done 
    in the past: dream on. In case anyone didn’t get the message: We are going 
    to start enforcing the permanent ban for duping, and we’re keeping logs of 
    the activity, If you are so stupid as to dupe after this warning... <br>
    <br>
    <b>Speed Hack Program Use on Darktide</b>: There have been plenty of complaints 
    about people using GEAR and similar speed hack programs to gain an unfair 
    advantage in PvP combat on Darktide. On Tuesday, all of that changes. The 
    auto-detection and enforcement for speed hacks will be turned on for 
    Darktide during the hot fix. When a speed hack is detected, the following 
    process will take place:<br>
    <br>
    The First Three Detections: You will be booted offline and a message will 
    display that you have been detected using a speed hack. The message will 
    give an email address you can write for more information, if you wish.<br>
    <br>
    The Fourth Detection: You will be booted offline and given a one day ban.<br>
    <br>
    Detections Five and Greater: You will be booted offline and give a 3 day ban 
    for each detection above the fourth one. This means that, basically, anyone 
    who gets to the fifth detection and insists on continuing to use a speed 
    hack will get to play about 2 minutes per week.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As part of this effort, we will be cleaning out the detection list on 
    Tuesday and resetting to zero everyone’s speed hack detection count on 
    Darktide. Everyone starts with a clean slate. What happens after that is up 
    to you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    And since we’ll be activating Player Killer Lite soon, we’ll be turning on 
    speed hack detection on the other servers soon, too. Be warned.</font><p>&nbsp;<hr width="65%">
