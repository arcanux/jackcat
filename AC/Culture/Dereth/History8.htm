      12/Earth: January 2001</b></span><br>
      <br>
      After several months of living in the darkness cast by the shadows of the
      Hopeslayer and his minions, the children of Ispar looked out onto the land
      and saw that the taint of hate and corruption was diminishing.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gone from the night sky were the pervasive
      red lightning and the watchful glare of Bael'Zharon. The waters regained
      their sparkling blue hue and the snows of winter fell lighter than they
      had the prior year. A quiet respite had fallen across Dereth.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the silence there came a great sundering
      as a floodgate of power unleashed by the return of the Hopeslayer and his
      subsequent dismissal ushered in a new age for the Magi of Dereth. High in
      the mountains, removed from nearly any sign of civilization, a Menhir
      sprang forth emanating an essence of bygone power.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was here, at the Essence of Strife, that
      the Magi of the Arm transported scrolls of immense power garnered from the
      chests strewn across the Obsidian Plains. These scrolls given over to the
      Essence became an arcane understanding that had long been absent from
      Dereth. A new sphere had opened to the Arch Magi of war, brought on by the
      resurgence of more powerful magics.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a result of this awakened power, Magi
      traversed the land through the use of new gems capable of opening portals
      to outpost towns. Through their use, Magi assisted trade caravans in
      bringing the reagents necessary for casting the higher spheres to all
      towns around Dereth. Aided by the explorer society, these caravans
      assisted the outpost towns in making their wares more accessible to new
      arrivals from Ispar.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the hall of the fallen Hopeslayer,
      warriors who wished to return to the scene of the final battle against
      evil were met with an unusual discovery. An infusion of black blood could
      now be retrieved from within the walls of this corrupt hall to alter the
      Sword of Lost Light. Speculation arose as to whether this was a gift of
      Asheron for the defeat of Bael'Zharon or a subtle reminder of the
      Hopeslayer's influence. Though the truth of its appearance remained a
      mystery, warriors forever altered their hard-won reward into the Sword of
      Lost Hope.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Travelers discovered that the halls leading
      to where the final stand took place had become more difficult to traverse,
      bolstered by the remnants of those who would keep the Hopeslayer forever
      imprisoned.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Traversing the land, aided by sword and
      dagger warriors newly armed with hilted weapons crafted by the bandits of
      MacNiall's and MacDugal's forces, parties discovered that the denizens of
      Dereth had migrated over the land. The new groupings of like species
      inspired the greatest of Dereth's guardians to journey the world together.
      As they adventured and experienced the evolution of the Derethian
      landscape, fellowships found that together they received greater rewards
      than they had ever obtained before.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the larger cities and outlying towns
      however, there was the calm that had come after the storm, a time of
      reflection and rest that was well deserved and hard won. Only one question
      remained.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">What was to come next?</font>
