            Legions Press Preview Event<br>
            <br>
            On the morning of Wednesday, February16th, I set out for the 
            airport. It was time to show the press what our AC1 and AC2 
            expansion packs were all about. The event was to be held in San 
            Francisco, at Shanghai 1930. Personally, I like flying, but the trek 
            to San Francisco is no small journey; it’s almost literally coast to 
            coast. I’m not one of those people who can sleep on a plane, either. 
            Oh well, I was sure there would be a decent movie to help pass the 
            time, and I wanted plenty of time to review the event schedule. It 
            had been a pretty busy couple of days on the forums, with the AC2HQ 
            exclusive screenshot series and the March content plans we’d posted 
            only just the evening before. <br>
            <br>
            I was soon on my way. It was to be a couple hours to Chicago, a 
            short layover, then the larger half of the trip from there to San 
            Francisco. Once on the San-Fran flight, I learned we would have FOUR 
            movies to choose from! Sweeeeet! Alas, however, they were all bad. 
            It was a blessing when the pick of the litter, Catwoman, glitched 
            out. I was left to surf the alternate channels. Luckily, they had 
            Discovery, Food Network, and HGTV. Wow, just like being at home! I 
            learned that polar bears are cannibals, and can smell a dead seal 
            from several miles away, and that Pinot Noir is one of the more 
            versatile wines for pairing with foods of any kind (not all in the 
            same show, of course). <br>
            <br>
            We touched down around 5:30 PM, went through the typical “look like 
            a mutant as you try to pop your ears” exercise, located the 
            cabstand, and soon arrived at the hotel. At the check-in counter, I 
            ran into Jessica, which was wonderful, because it meant that I was 
            at the right hotel, at approximately the right time. <br>
            <br>
            I had just enough time to stow my stuff before it was time to 
            convene for the team dinner, at a little German restaurant called 
            Suppenkuche. We’d been griefing our marketing guy earlier since he 
            had set up the dinner plans, warning him that we had refined tastes 
            and were accustomed to only the finest fare. He assured us that 
            Suppenkuche was German for “soup kitchen”, but I think soup would 
            have been disqualified from the menu for not being dense enough. The 
            food was very authentic; fried potato, pureed potato, boiled 
            potato…like a truckload of rocks being dumped down a well, but it 
            was all sooo goooood! And German beer, of course, most excellent. It 
            was great to see Ibn and Jessica again, and we talked of many 
            things, but we made it a relatively early night. Everyone’s thoughts 
            were on the big day tomorrow, and we wanted to be in top form. <br>
            <br>
            Thursday, February 17th I woke before the alarm went off (I so HATE 
            that I do that!). As I got ready, I caught some great early-season 
            Buffy (the Zander hyena episode, classic). Then I headed down to the 
            breakfast bar, where Citan and Argus were already noshing. The 
            coffee was excellent. The rest of our East and West-coast staff soon 
            joined us, and we all made our way to the nearby Shanghai. <br>
            <br>
            My first impression of the location – beautiful. Shanghai is a 
            members-club sort of establishment, with special speakeasy-style 
            cigar rooms, a jazz bar, and lush decor. There was an alcove next to 
            our space containing a small number of exclusive lockers for members 
            to store their primo cigars. One of these lockers belongs to the 
            Governor…a.k.a. Ahhhnold. Our event would take place in a 
            well-appointed sitting room with its own bar, and a second side room 
            for our top-secret meetings and…boxes. Both rooms were furnished 
            with the most comfortable leather chairs you can imagine. I recalled 
            the image from Memorex ads I think, of the guy sitting waaay back in 
            his chair getting blown away by his awesome audio tape recordings 
            (which is pretty funny all on its own). Well, that was one of THESE 
            chairs. Oh, and the coffee they brought out was even better than the 
            last 2 cups I’d had at breakfast. I did kind of get pretty wired on 
            coffee in a very short amount of time, but hey, we were excited! 
            This was to be our first press event as a publisher, and wired was a 
            fine place to be, because there was much to be done. <br>
            <br>
            We spent the morning setting up the space, and the tech equipment 
            needed for our various demo stations and promo movies (you’ll be 
            seeing a web version of the Legions promo movie from this event 
            soon). The swag kits and name badges were assembled, while the 
            technical crew decked the place with flat-panels. Our Sony partner 
            crew arrived at this point, along with our publicity partners. <br>

            Our main Legions demo station was for four – one leader and three 
            players, who would be guided through a simple Knorr quest to get a 
            feel for the game. The quest started on a farm in a really nice 
            rolling hills location, with some vibrant fall-colored trees you 
            haven’t seen just yet. Our users would then teleport to Vothardun, 
            the creepy foggy locale the team affectionately refers to as “Zombie 
            Town” (won’t you take me to…) to complete the quest. The characters 
            were pre-rolled with a good set of flashy hotkey skills and an 
            inability to actually die. There was an Empyrean Mentalist, a Lugian 
            and a Tumerok decked out in new armor and weapons even I had never 
            seen before, and…our secret surprise. <br>
            <br>
            One of the things we were most proud of and excited to announce at 
            this event was our pre-order bonus. There he stood, next to his 
            fellow adventurers, ready to take his place amongst the free peoples 
            of Dereth – the playable drudge. For those of you wondering why we 
            haven’t announced the winners for the Skill-naming contest yet, 
            well, it was because the winning skill name belonged to a Drudge 
            skill! The Drudge exhibits the sense of humor that the AC franchise 
            is known for in all it’s lovingly crafted glory. Wait till you see. 
            Anyway, players who pre-order Legions will be able to create and 
            play drudges right away. At a later date, a quest to unlock the race 
            will be available, but this quest will have a pretty high 
            level-requirement (60-ish). Personally, I plan to take the easy 
            route and pre-order the bonus bundle - when it is available, which 
            is not right now, but soon. You’ll be seeing more about the Drudge 
            in the coming month. <br>

            </center>
            <p><font size="2" face="arial">So where was I? Oh yes, so we have the 4-player 
            guided demo station, and a second private station for additional 
            showings. AC1 had a demo station where they could show off the 
            before and after of the graphics engine upgrade that will ship with 
            Throne of Destiny. They’ve done a great job, by the way, and they 
            have…penguins…which I think speaks for itself. <br>
            <br>
            Setup was completed in plenty of time, and then it was just a matter 
            of going over Argus and Jessica’s talks about the expansion packs, 
            and last-minute walkthrough reminders from marketing. At one point, 
            a regular member of a gentlemen’s club at Shanghai accidentally 
            wandered into our area, and peeling him away from the Legions demo 
            station was no easy task. Marketing was happy to take his business 
            card, but he’ll just have to pre-order like the rest of us! <br>

            I was to begin the evening at reception, meeting and greeting the 
            press, and getting them their nametags. Two ladies from our partner 
            teams were also on hand for reception, and we earned the nickname 
            “Charlie’s Angels” later on when things got rough, but I’ll get to 
            that. The reception area happened to be right where those special 
            cigar lockers I mentioned earlier were. Our event was to the right, 
            and the rest of the club was to the left. Around 5:45, the press 
            began to arrive. One of our first guests was Tapuaua from Warcry, 
            and she came bearing coffee and chocolate! I had a Reece’s peanut 
            butter cup moment then, and resolved to experiment with the “Lik’m 
            Aid” method of combining chocolate bars and ground coffee in the 
            near future. An idea that’s time has come, I think. <br>
            <br>
            Well, by now apparently our wandering guest from earlier had told 
            several of his club friends that the other half of the club was 
            being used and was therefore off-limits, but there were games in 
            there. Reception became a rather interesting place to be when 
            unauthorized individuals suddenly started trying to get into the 
            press event for a peek. We heard several likely stories, ranging 
            from “I’m just going in there to use the restroom”, “I’m just going 
            to the bar real quick” and “It’s ok, I’m a member of this 
            establishment” to the last-ditch “I’m a waiter here” (yes, he really 
            did say that, and no, he wasn’t a waiter). We saw through all these 
            clever ploys, and refused to be swayed by the pointing out of their 
            own cigar lockers on the cigar wall (“I have a box here, you know, 
            and over there, that’s Ahhnold’s box). They too, will have to wait 
            for the expansion (except for Ahhnold, I think we could sneak him 
            into the Playtest). <br>
            <br>
            The event was a great success, and the members of the media reacted 
            very favorably to Legions, noting how graphically excellent the game 
            looks. They also got quite a kick from our Drudge, with his faithful 
            “rabid bunny” fighting at his side. At 9 PM our event concluded, and 
            we bid a fond farewell to the last of our press guests. The AC2 
            community has asked that they be given a heads-up when Legions 
            coverage is coming. Well…heads-up! You’ll be seeing reports from the 
            event starting as soon as this week, and continuing through launch.
            <br>
            <br>
            When all had departed, we gathered for a moment of warm basking, and 
            the club brought us cigars and some pretty incredible Tequila - so 
            good it actually demanded sipping, Patron Añejo, I believe it was 
            called. As Ferris Bueller once said, “If you have the means, I 
            highly recommend picking one up”. We had a toast, and afterwards, 
            breakdown commenced. Everything was pretty much completed by 11 PM, 
            but spirits were high and the night was young. Suffice it to say 
            that Ibn and I made good and frequent use of the threat, “That’s 
            going in the blog!” for the rest of the evening. <br>
            <br>
            In the morning, I made my way to the airport for another day of 
            flying. At least, I thought, I would surely have a better choice of 
            movie than the vile “not-Michelle Pfeiffer” Catwoman. As the flight 
            got underway, however, I discovered that this time, there was only 
            one movie…Shall We Dance. No, no…I think we shall not. Let me tell 
            you guys, mainstream America can be a very scary place. Thank 
            goodness I had a blog that needed writing. </font>
