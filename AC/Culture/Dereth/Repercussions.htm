    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She placed the cloth against his brow. It still burned, 
    the fever having held him now for ten nights and showing no sign of abating. 
    She had never seen him ill, and to look at him now with sunken cheeks and 
    ashen skin brought her near to tears. But she had not cried since she had 
    lost Thorsten, and she was not going to cry now. She was not going to lose 
    Asheron. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">When Thorsten died, she had hated Asheron. Hated 
    everything that he was and what he had done to them, allowing them to enter 
    that place without his protection. She had thought him a coward, a nothing, 
    a scared old man who hid in his tower and played at a game of chess in which 
    she and the other Isparians were pawns. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She had pulled herself from that Olthoi hive, tired and 
    broken, one of the few survivors against the True Queen and her armies. She 
    had clawed her way back into the daylight not for herself, but for her son. 
    She had lost everything but the child inside of her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The Aluvian people, newly freed from their slavery, had 
    flocked to her and named her their Queen. Soon, other pockets of humans 
    crept out of the darkness. New Aluvia grew as Elysa developed into a strong 
    and powerful leader whose command went unquestioned. But her sorrow had 
    continued to weigh heavily upon her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She had written to her friend, Lania Cartoth, shortly 
    after Thorsten's death. Elysa had continued the correspondence for some 
    time, but the duties of a new Queen restricted her time and the years had 
    kept her parted from her friend. Lania was now dead, slain at the hands of 
    someone, or something--the same someone or something that now commanded the 
    undead in the halls housing Thorsten's armor and axe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Nuhmudira had disappeared after it was revealed she had 
    sacrificed her loyal Zharalim in a hidden temple beneath her mansion. 
    Sclavus had taken control of the place now, as they had every place that 
    Nuhmudira had once frequented. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Worse, the thing that had been Candeth Martine had become 
    obsessed with Elysa. He was fixated, deviant, and intrusive. She felt 
    betrayed by everyone, everything. Nothing was right. Everything was falling 
    apart around her. But Elysa was made of a far stronger fiber than anyone had 
    ever credited. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Anyone save Asheron. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He had come to her shortly after Thorsten's death, 
    remorseful and sincere. He'd helped her then, helped her to cope. He'd 
    provided assistance in the establishment of Cragstone and in the building of 
    Thorsten's tomb. Asheron had sealed the true resting place of Thorsten's 
    armor and axe with powerful magics, concealing them from the encroaching 
    monsters that eventually overran the underground city that had once been the 
    Isparians' home. He was a rock. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She had despised him so. Yet, in the end, she had found 
    that the only one who understood her isolation was Asheron. He too, was 
    alone. His resolve and his determination had given her the strength to 
    continue, to grow, and to lead. She had left her people once, for some five 
    years, while she studied and learned from Asheron. She had come to know him 
    then, to respect and understand him, and to love him as a friend and kindred 
    soul. </font></p>
      <p><font face="arial" size="2">She had never seen him weak. She had seen him fail, but 
      failure was a learning experience, a new way to study a problem. She had 
      never seen him like this, and she feared for him, for everyone. She wrung 
      the cloth she had dipped in water. As she did, the mumbling began again.</font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">Asheron watched from within his study as they 
    approached. Gaerlan strode through the hall after his brother Delacim, their 
    footfalls resounding off the alabaster floor and ceiling. He was Delacim's 
    junior by some twenty years, less skilled and even more headstrong. Avarice 
    drove him, and his relation to Asheron's apprentice afforded him some minor 
    freedoms that he used to the fullest. Gaining the Emperor's ear at a formal 
    gathering had been one such freedom.</font></i><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">Gaerlan was a poor student and had none of his 
    brother's natural aptitude. That he would insist on sitting in on lessons 
    and listening to lectures meant nothing to Asheron. Delacim was to be 
    Asheron's successor. Whatever minor inconveniences Asheron needed to endure 
    were insubstantial, but he had underestimated Gaerlan's capacity for 
    recollection and retention.</font></i><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="arial" size="2">During a banquet held in Asheron's honor after a visit 
    to another world, Gaerlan's devious nature was brought to the elder man's 
    attention. As he watched the two brothers enter his study, that earlier 
    conversation played over in Asheron's mind:</font></i><font size="2"> </font>
    </p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">“Vizier.”Emperor Kellin II made his way toward Asheron 
    and took his arm. He waved his escort away and brought the mage onto a 
    balustrade that overlooked the capital city and the Haelin River. “I have 
    been speaking to your student, Gaerlan.”</font></i><font size="2"> </font>
    </p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">“Excellency, Gaerlan is no student of mine. He is a 
    brother to my apprentice--”Asheron tried to protest.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">But the Emperor continued, “Long-lived men such as 
    yourself should be more careful with whom they allow in classrooms. 
    Especially when they speak of history as though they lived it.”The Emperor's 
    eyes met his. “Valind shall be spared your tale, Asheron. I will see to 
    that. But, there will be changes and efforts made to reinforce your 
    expeditions. The Throne must hold a much tighter reign, it seems.”He clapped 
    Asheron on the back and stepped through the golden doorway into the 
    arboretum. Asheron was left there, staring out over the river.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">The next morning their ship was loaded with the leading 
    scholars of the court, chosen to become Adepts of Asheron's lessons and 
    studies. As they departed for the Knorr Lyceum, Asheron appointed Delacim 
    his chief assistant, placing him in charge of teaching the new Adepts.</font></i><font face="arial" size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He shivered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Elysa pulled the silken sheet over him more tightly. Blood 
    stained the dressing on his chest. The wound had still not closed. 
    “Strength, Elysa, strength.” She looked at her friend and thought back to 
    two months before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The news of Lania's fate had come on the heels of 
    Nuhmudira's betrayal. Antius had reported movements of Martine's forces on 
    Marae Lassel, and Elysa's councilors had responded like frightened Mites, 
    each one shouting disparate views of what venture would be best. Fuming and 
    saddened, Elysa had cursed everything that had happened since she arrived on 
    Dereth. She had cursed Thorsten, Nuhmudira, and Asheron in turn. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Martine had been there, listening all along, watching her 
    from the shadows, silent. She hadn't noticed. She had settled for bed, and 
    as she drifted into a lazy dream he had made his move. At first she had 
    thought it was a dream, then came the realization that he was truly there. 
    How often had it happened before? How often had he come to her room and 
    watched her as she slept? When he stepped from the shadow, a grim, violet 
    halo wreathing his mask-clad head, she had wanted to leap, even scream, but 
    he had pinned her in the air with the dark arts the Virindi had taught him.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He stumbled toward her in his misshapen canter, spouting 
    words of love. Calling her name, he drew closer. She had wanted to reach for 
    her bow, to strike him down and end all of this. But she was motionless, 
    unable to respond. This was the moment she had always feared. And then, she 
    had heard Asheron's voice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She would not admit the relief she had felt at his timely 
    arrival. He had not betrayed her again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She looked upon him now and cursed herself. She knew there 
    was nothing that she could have done, nothing that would have changed the 
    moment, but it still pained her and preyed in the shadows of her mind.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He shivered again. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">As the brothers crossed the study's threshold, Asheron 
    noticed the brooch adorning Gaerlan's collar. It was a gift from the 
    Emperor, a cresting wave in the color of the throne, cerulean.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">The Emperor had been true to his word; no further 
    utterance had been made about Asheron's longevity. The years had passed 
    uneventfully, and Valind had never come to Asheron's school nor hindered his 
    teaching. But the reach of the Throne was great and now rested within the 
    mage's halls.</font></i><font face="arial" size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">The two brothers met his gaze and bowed, in a salute of 
    honor, before they made their way to the sapphire chairs. Asheron bade them 
    sit and took a seat across from them behind his alabaster desk.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">Delacim was the shorter of the two and fairer. His 
    fingers were thin and long, matching his slight frame. His hair was the 
    color of the setting sun of autumn, a rich red. He wore braids on either 
    side of his brow. He wore the robes of the apprentice, a deep and regal blue 
    trimmed in violet.</font></i><font face="arial" size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">His brother was slightly taller. His hair was dark, and 
    he wore a sharply pointed beard. His eyes were a cold steel blue and he wore 
    a scowl upon his face. He never seemed happy.</font></i><font size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">“Delacim. Gaerlan. I have consulted my charts and 
    formulated a destination to a new world. I would like to begin preparations 
    for a visit but wanted to ensure your work was done on Aerlinthe.”</font></i><font face="arial" size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">“Master,”Delacim spoke crisply and clearly. “I have 
    nearly completed my study of the portal structures across Aerlinthe and back 
    to the mainland. Little has hindered my progress and the populace has been 
    more than cooperative.”He paused. “Gaerlan has been helpful as well, as an 
    intermediary with the workers. He has also assisted in the construction of 
    several automata that will be deployed in the lower areas of the foundry. 
    One small note of concern has arisen over rumblings that have begun to the 
    southeast of the island. I have yet to investigate myself--”</font></i><font face="arial" size="2">
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">“I have been to the affected area,”Gaerlan interrupted. 
    “And found that there is little there, other than a place where the 
    invisible river flows strong.”His gaze was always more harsh and challenging 
    than Delacim's. “I will investigate further on my own if you wish, but 
    truthfully, it is something too meager for your apprentice to pay particular 
    heed to it.”</font></i><font face="arial" size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><i><font face="arial" size="2">Asheron thought a moment, meeting the steel gaze of the 
    young man. As he thought about his response, Gaerlan moved a hand to adjust 
    the brooch. “Very well, Gaerlan,”Asheron said. “Investigate if you wish. If 
    you say that there is no need for Delacim's involvement, I shall trust your 
    judgment.”He paused and pulled at his long beard. “We have other matters 
    that must be discussed.”</font></i><font face="arial" size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The darkness was all around Nuhmudira now. As her strength 
    faded, the sound of footsteps and visits grew more infrequent. Her people 
    had passed their judgment. She was not dead, not yet, but there was nothing 
    shielding her from the shroud of death that surrounded her. Others memories 
    had eroded her own as the ocean takes the shore. It was a battle she had 
    lost, long ago. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Her chest grew heavy with each breath, mired by the weight 
    of guilt and the ravenous hunger of jealousy over losing her power. Even 
    now, as she lay upon this slab with death closing upon her, she wished for 
    nothing more than the power that had once been hers. She knew that she could 
    make everything right if only she had-- </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The song began as a lullaby, a soothing lullaby sung by 
    the voice of an angel. It echoed in the near-empty room and reverberated 
    through her sagging flesh and into her bones. Then came the voice, singing 
    to her, calling to her. It asked, and she answered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The first of the Sclavus crested the top of the structure 
    and emptied its throat into the basin beneath her head. The second began to 
    hiss a rite that was unfamiliar to her at first, but as it continued she 
    found she knew the words, the inflection, the power that it was infusing. 
    She raised her broken voice to echo that of the Sclavus. Others clamored 
    over the edge of the tower and arranged themselves in the correct order for 
    the ritual to succeed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The darkness was no longer the cold captor it had been. 
    Memories that were hers began to drive back the tide, and as the final words 
    were spoken and her bonds shattered, only one thought came to her. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Freedom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Thoughts. They consumed him. He had not moved from his 
    throne in days. He had remained stoic. His eyes were vigilantly fixated on a 
    tiny grain of sand that was a shade lighter than the stone brick that lay in 
    the middle of the wall opposite him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">For days he had stared at that one point. Servants had 
    entered and left, until he sealed the doors. Now there were only two guards. 
    Two of his most trusted, Hibdin and Ambrosia, stood watch over his room. He 
    was silent, but coherent and mindful. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Voices echoed along the walls of his retreat from time to 
    time, but that mattered little to him. The oddly colored grain of sand 
    remained the focus of his gaze and it hadn't moved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He clutched the book tightly in his hands, and wondered 
    how long it would be before they came for him, he who had become the 
    hope-slayer. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">“The four of you shall be my commanders, my ears, eyes, 
    arms, and swords against his heart. He is not dead yet, I can feel that 
    much, but he drains himself by using his arts to hide from me. It will 
    matter little in the end.” Gaerlan paused and looked over his generals, each 
    the epitome of their kind, the absolute elementals. “The wound that Martine 
    gave him is fatal. There is no one left on this world with magic powerful 
    enough who would save Asheron.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">***** </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">A tiny voice broke the silence that had filled the room 
    when his murmuring ceased. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">“Mother? Is Uncle Asheron going to die?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Borelean stood at the door, upright, tall, young, and 
    innocent. His eyes were wide and curious, but not at all the eyes of an 
    eleven year-old boy. His features were not quite that of a young man, but 
    they had lost their youthful vigor, taking on the more distinct edges of his 
    father. Elysa mustered a weak smile and put her hand out for him to come to 
    her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">As she pulled him close to her and kissed the top of his 
    head, she fought the tears and hugged him tightly. “I pray he does not, 
    Borelean, I pray he does not.”</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">June 18</span>, 2002 </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A world without Asheron. Even those Isparians 
    who had spoken the loudest against him now have a difficult time imagining a 
    world without him. He had been with the Isparian people since their arrival 
    through the release of the Hopeslayer and the formation of the New 
    Singularity. For some, Asheron has seemed as constant as the two moons 
    circling in the night sky. Now he lies mortally wounded in his castle, the 
    life slowly draining out of him. What will become of the world if Asheron 
    falls? Even the insane Martine, a man those on the fringes of society 
    proclaimed to be a hero of the Isparian people, has been driven into 
    catatonia once it was revealed he had been Gaerlan's pawn. And this Gaerlan, 
    an Empyrean bent on Asheron's destruction, how has he returned to Dereth and 
    why does he hate Asheron? Yet in the minds of the Isparians, one question 
    rises above all others: can High Queen Elysa and her people resist Gaerlan 
    and his Elemental army? </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are still glimmers of hope. With the 
    knowledge Asheron shared with them, Arcanum researchers have rediscovered 
    primitive Empyrean transmutation techniques, which the Isparians label 
    “Tinkering.” Those skilled in assessing the value and workmanship of weapons 
    and armor rapidly have begun salvaging and enhancing their wares with these 
    techniques. Moreover, all are able to benefit from these discoveries, not 
    just those skilled in tinkering. With an Ust in hand, even the dimmest 
    warrior can salvage materials from items in the field, thus lightening his 
    pack and allowing him to stay in the fray longer! </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In Zaikhal, those members of the Arcanum who 
    had never despaired of releasing Nuhmudira from her imprisonment have 
    brought back a disturbing report. Nuhmudira is once more missing. Hearing 
    this, her most zealous followers proclaim that she has escaped her 
    imprisonment and is now working to atone for her sins. As proof that she is 
    aiding them in their battles, these zealots point to the fact that even more 
    powerful weapons are being found in the land. More rational minds remain 
    skeptical, yet they are grateful nonetheless for these new tools in their 
    fight against Gaerlan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The disturbances that Gaerlan has caused in 
    the forces of magic continue to destabilize the world's magical fields. In 
    the previous month, these disturbances appeared as a reduction in the power 
    of various spells. Now, those dependent upon Life Magic find their ability 
    to harm other creatures through their magics changed and in many ways 
    hampered. Fortunately, to help them overcome these new restrictions on their 
    abilities and develop new techniques, the master archmages have researched 
    new spells. Given the name “Life Bolts,” these spells involve taking a 
    portion of a mage's life force and hurling it at a target to inflict damage. 
    The thought of intentionally hurting themselves through their magics puts 
    more than a few mages off, but the majority vow to try these new magics and 
    learn to be effective in the field once more. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With Gaerlan revealed and his elemental army 
    forming, a scheme started long ago now reaches fruition. The world may be 
    forever changed. </font></p>

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Several new features have been added to 
      the spell book. At the bottom of the spell book panel, we've added 
      filtering buttons to allow you to choose to display spells from a specific 
      school and level. With these new filtering options, the spell book is once 
      again sorting spells alphabetically by name, with the exception of level 7

      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A new “@font” command has been added that 
      will allow you to change the font used by your <i>Asheron's Call </i>
      client. For full details on how to use this new command, type “@help font” 
      in the chat window. Remember that any changes you make to your font won't 
      show up until you completely restart your client; logging your character

    With the addition of Tinkering to the game, we've introduced a number of

    Tinkering Letter to the Players</a>. </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Appraisal skills have been removed and new 
      Tinkering skills have been added in their place. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All skill credits spent to purchase 
      appraisal skills have been refunded to the characters. Gharu'ndim 
      characters are the exception; all Gharu'ndim characters are now trained in 
      Item Tinkering, which replaces the racial default Item Appraisal skill.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All experience spent on Appraisal skills, 
      no matter what the character's race, has been refunded. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spells that increased or decreased the 
      Appraisal skill of a character now affect Tinkering skills. The Item 
      spells that increased or decreased an item's resistance to being Appraised 
      are still available, but at this time serve no purpose. These Item spells 
      may be removed or given a new purpose in the future. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Ust (the tool used to salvage 
      materials) and a book explaining the basics of Tinkering can be found on 
      sale in the original nine Nexus towns and the racial capital cities of 
      Cragstone, Hebian-to, and Zaikhal. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to ensure a good mix of materials 
      at all workmanship levels, the rates at which certain materials are 
      dropped have been slightly tweaked. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All items that can be enhanced or salvaged 
      now display their workmanship as both a name and a numeric value in a 
      separate field when examined. Items without this field cannot be enhanced 
      or salvaged. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Before any enhancement takes place, a 
      confirmation box appears to make sure the player wants to perform this 
      operation. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tinkered items display the number of times 
      they have been Tinkered and the name of the last person to Tinker the 
      item. Time to make a name for yourself! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">In an effort to keep Tinkering honest, any 
      time a Tinker attempts to enhance an item, a local emote will broadcast 
      the result of this interaction. Typing “@filter --craft” can filter out 
      these broadcasts from the chat window. Of course, we recommend that you 
      remove this filter any time you have an item Tinkered by a third party. 
      The local emote broadcast will contain the following information: the name 
      of the item being enhanced, the type of material being applied, and the 
      workmanship of the material being applied. If the item being enhanced is 
      inscribed, the author of the inscription is also broadcast. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Miscellaneous Improvements and Changes </b></span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The long-fabled “Wi flag,” a troublesome 
      bug that would cause creatures to consistently pick one character to 
      attack over others, has been found and squashed. Wi will live on in our 
      memories. . . </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Prismatic Tapers now stack up to 1,000 
      tapers per stack. Mages rejoice at their regained pack space! </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The “@fillcomps” command can now purchase 
      up to 5,000 of one item. Also typing “@fillcomps --clear” will clear out 
      the list and amounts of components the command will try to purchase.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Trade notes worth 150,000, 200,000 and 
      250,000 pyreals can now be found on all vendors that sell 100,000-pyreal 
      trade notes. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to the size of fonts on some systems, 
      the client was truncating the display of 10,000 pyreal stacks to 1000. 
      This has been corrected. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Portals to house dungeons can no longer be 
      linked or recalled to. This should prevent you from losing your portal 
      recall when you enter your house's dungeon. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Deadly Atlatl darts can now be crafted.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">New Royal Atlatls, with significantly 
      higher damage modifiers, can be found as treasure. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Arms such as the Isparian weapons, that do 
      increased damage against certain types of creatures, now display this 
      “Slayer” information when examined. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters no longer turn towards a target 
      when they try to Appraise it. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters that pass through portals 
      before landing on the ground no longer receive impact damage from the 
      portal. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The addition of Foci backpacks introduced 
      the unintended change of making it impossible to open backpacks that were 
      on the ground. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We fixed a bug that would destroy items 
      with wield requirements if a character attempted to wield that item 
      directly from the ground and not from their inventory. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">It is no longer possible to stand upon the 
      Basalt and Obsidian Shards found in various parts of Dereth. This should 
      prevent characters from perching on these shards and attacking creatures.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've lowered the prices for a number of 
      cooking and fletching creations. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Vendors are trying to display their wares 
      in a more logical order. Prismatic Tapers and Scarabs can now be found at 
      the beginning of component lists, while spell scrolls should now be in a 
      roughly alphabetical order. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="Head"><b>Minor Details </b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters can no longer log off in The 
      New Singularity dungeon, which is accessible by providing the correct 
      items to Ecorto the Lost Director. Any character that is logged off in the 
      dungeon will log in at their Lifestone. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've fixed a bug in the Arcane Pedestal 
      Quest that caused Slithe Tradditor to hand back a Sclavus bronze statue 
      part if given a Skeleton bronze statue part. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The security in the Tenkarrdun Foundry has 
      been beefed up again. Along with a few more changes to areas favored by 
      macros, we've added a few Pyreal Golems to spice things up. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">All scrolls should now correctly display 
      whether they are “Self” or “Other” versions of the spell. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">When accessing the Covenant Crystal, the 
      display should default to the “Buy” panel for unowned housing and to the 
      “Maintenance” panel for owned housing. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Barkeeps now sell festival lights.
      </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We've added an Item Scrivener to Uziz, and 
      a 3rd level Item vendor and 4th Level Item vendor to Hebian-To. </font>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The mana cost on Blade Volleys has been 
      cut in half to match the mana cost for the other Volleys. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">The mouse-over locations for Wei Jhou and 
      Danby's Outpost were slightly off. These have been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Characters can now wield Flags in their 
      weapons slot. </font></li>

      <a style="color: #FFFFCC" target="_blank" href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEeventbuild.asp">
      dev notes</a> give an overview of what the Tinkering system is and how to 
      use it. We're really excited about this system, and we hope you enjoy it. 
      Characters can find the Ust Tinkering tool and a book which explains the 
      Tinkering system in the nine newbie towns and the capital cities (Zaikhal, 
      Cragstone, and Hebian-To). </font></p>
      <p><span class="Head"><b>Treasure System Changes </b></span>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      This month, we implement the final major step to our treasure system 
      revamping begun back in January. (There will be some minor tweaks and 
      additions in August or September.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One change which may not be immediately 
      obvious is the elimination of such treasure system oddities as a 6-11 
      sword with a 250 wield requirement on it. The existence of this type of 
      weapon occurred because we had to use one type of treasure system to 
      generate the basic weapon, and a different system to determine whether the 
      weapon carried a damage bonus that demanded a wield requirement. We have 
      now combined these systems so that all weapons have logical parameters for 
      when they require a wield requirement. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another result of this change will be the 
      more frequent appearance of higher-damage weapons in all levels of the 
      treasure system. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also took this opportunity to increase 
      the maximum damage of all weapons, and introduce a new discrete level for 
      the wield requirement. Weapons which now reach their maximum damage 
      potential will have a wield requirement of 325. Each weapon will still 
      have a range of damage that produces a wield requirement of 250. The 
      maximum damage potential (and variance ranges) are listed below. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please keep in mind that these numbers 
      represent the ranges for treasure found at high levels (e.g., from SIK 
      chests and certain monsters such as Umbris Shadows), and the very highest 
      levels of treasures, such as Singularity Chests and Crystal Lords. 
      Generally, both of these levels of treasure have the same maximum limit 
      when it comes to damage, but you will be more likely to find quality items 
      from Singularity Chests then you will from SIK chests. </font></p>
      <p><span class="Head"><b>Weapons: </b></span>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Melee weapons now have a maximum attack 
        and defense bonus of 15% (but only through Singularity Chests. SIK 
        Chest-type loot can only reach a maximum of 12%). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Swords now have a max damage capacity of 
        40. Their variance can shrink to .40. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Axes have a max damage capacity of 36. 
        Their variance can shrink to .40. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Maces have a max damage capacity of 33. 
        Their variance can shrink to .30 (and in some extremely rare cases, 
        .25). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Spears have a max damage capacity of 28. 
        Their variance can shrink to .45. (These numbers really only apply to 
        tridents.) </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Unarmed Weapons have a max damage 
        capacity of 14. Rarely, their variance can shrink to .60 (and in some 
        very rare cases, .50). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Staves have a max damage capacity of 15. 
        Their variance can shrink to .30 (and in some extremely rare cases, 
        .25). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Daggers remain unchanged for now. </font>
        </li>
        <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bows and Royal Atlatls now have a max 
        damage bonus of 130%. 130% and 120% bows/atlatls have a wield 
        requirement of 250. 150% crossbows now also exist, along with a wield 
        requirement of 250. As mentioned in the bottom section of this letter, 
        missile launchers no longer have attack bonuses, but instead have 
        defense bonuses. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span class="Head"><b>Armor: </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <br>
      Generally, armor has the potential to have higher armor levels for each 
      type of armor. </font></p>
      <p><span class="Head"><b>Housing </b></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <br>
      This month, we're releasing another 150 Cottages, 40 Villas, and 10 
      Mansions. We also released another 500 Residential Quarters. For at least 
      the next few months, we will see how much housing demand we can meet with 
      the Residential Quarters, as we are quickly running out of room to put in 
      new landscape dwellings. </font></p>
      <p><span class="Head"><b>Next Month and Beyond </b></span>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      Next month will see additional Tinkering interactions, additional 
      Residential Quarters, a lot of exciting new content, the addition of a 
      skill-based bonus for War spells, and more! We'll see you next month.

      <p><span class="Head"><b>Two Secrets </b></span>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      As we mentioned in last month's
      <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/news/ASHEletter0602.asp" style="color: #FFFFCC">
      Letter to the Players</a>, there are two secrets about which we feel it is 
      time for us to come clean. One we've suspected for a long time, but the 
      issue proved ever elusive to track down (so elusive, in fact, that we 
      wondered whether it ever existed, our own anecdotal evidence to the 
      contrary). The other we've known about for awhile, but we were unsure what 
      to do about it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now the truth will be revealed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, the Wi Flag. For those of you who 
      don't know what the Wi Flag means, a little history. From the beginning of
      <i>AC</i>, some players have complained about unbelievably bad luck. When 
      the swarm of Lugians spawn in the citadel, they will go after certain 
      players--every time. The player's level doesn't seem to matter, nor does 
      the number of other players in the room. What does seem to matter is that 
      this player is cursed with that most unfortunate of distinctions: the Wi 
      Flag. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For some players, the flag came and went. 
      For others, it was a perpetual nightmare, present in nearly every monster 
      experience. To live a Wi-Flagged life meant to be hunted at every turn. 
      Perhaps other adventurers could know peace in a BSD or a Citadel, but 
      there was no rest nor respite for one under Wi. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our developers at Turbine initially 
      answered these complaints by saying that they could find no such bug. 
      Occasionally, a senior Turbine engineer could be found who would admit 
      that perhaps there was something “not quite right” with the system, but 
      they still could not identify a cause, if one even existed. Easy culprits, 
      such as a malfunctioning random-number generator, were eventually 
      dismissed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But our search went on. For there were 
      people even at Turbine convinced that the Wi Flag existed, and that they 
      had it in spades. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And then one day, long after most people 
      had learned to either forget or ignore the Wi Flag, the answer was found. 
      Here in the report from Sandra Powers, <i>AC </i>Live's Lead Engineer, on 
      the nature of the Wi Flag. We warn you in advance that it is a very 
      technical explanation, but we hope it is of some interest to those of you 
      who have long been afflicted with this terrible burden. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Many of our players have complained for a 
      long time that their character are `Wi-Flagged'--that is, that creatures 
      attack them a much greater proportion of the time than random chance or 
      distance should dictate. After looking at the code in depth, I believe I 
      have found out why this might happen. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generally, a creature chooses whom to 
      attack based on who it was last attacking, who attacked it last, or who 
      caused it damage last. When players first enter the creature's detection 
      radius, however, none of these things are useful yet, so the creature 
      chooses a target randomly, weighted by distance. Players within the 
      creature's detection sphere are weighted by how close they are to the 
      creature -- the closer you are, the more chance you have to be selected to 
      be attacked. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The actual algorithm for selection looks 
      like this: We roll a random number within a certain range--say between 0 
      and 1. Each player is given a portion of the range based on how close they 
      are to the creature. The closer you are, the larger a portion you get. The 
      player who owns the portion into which the random number falls is selected 
      to be attacked. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This algorithm is sound. The problem comes 
      up when we are assigning portions of the range to various players. If we 
      wanted distance from the creature to be proportional to your chance to be 
      selected--that is, if the closer you are the *less* chance you have of 
      being attacked--then we would assign this range by taking your distance 
      from the creature over the total distance--the distances of everybody 
      under consideration added together. But we really want the inverse of this 
      ratio--so that the closer you are, the *more* chance you have of being 
      selected. So we invert this ratio by subtracting it from 1 to assign you 
      the size of your portion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An example: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A is 5 meters from the creature. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">B is 2 meters from the creature. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">C is 3 meters from the creature. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">D is 10 meters from the creature. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Total distance is 20. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The size of A's portion is 1 - 5/20, or 
      0.75. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The size of B's portion is 1 - 2/20, or 
      0.90. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The size of C's portion is 1 - 3/20, or 
      0.85. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The size of D's portion is 1 - 10/20, or 
      0.50. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So we assign these people these portions of 
      the total range: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A has between 0.00 and 0.75. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">B has between 0.75 and 1.65. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">C has between 1.65 and 2.50. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">D has between 2.50 and 3.00. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Notice, however, that while the original 
      ratios added to 1 (.25 + .1 + .15 + .5 = 1.0) that the inverted ratios -- 
      and thus the total range from which we should have rolled the random 
      number -- no longer add to 1. Instead, they add to 3. (Some algebra will 
      convince you that the assigned portions always add to n-1, where n is the 
      number of people under consideration.) So in order to randomly select some 
      portion of this total range, we should roll a number between 0 and 3.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But in the existing <i>AC </i>code, we 
      always roll a number between 0 and 1. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can easily see in this example that if 
      the random number is always been 0 and 1, only A and B have any chance at 
      all of being selected, and A has the majority of the chance. And the 
      reason that these two have all the chance is simply because they are first 
      in the list, and so were assigned the low parts of the range. Normally--if 
      we had rolled between 0 and 3 in the example--your order in the list 
      should have no effect on how likely you are to be chosen. But because we 
      only rolled between 0 and 1, the earlier you appear in the list, the more 
      skewed your chance of selection is. And as it happens, in <i>AC </i>code, 
      your position in this list is determined by the InstanceID of your 
      character, which is assigned when you create the character and never 
      changed. (Note that the InstanceID is hashed--mutated by the system into 
      another number--to determine position. So it's not a simple relationship 
      like the older the character, the earlier in the list they will be. It is, 
      however, a static relationship--an ID that hashes to an early position 
      will always hash to an early position, although it's exact position will 
      depend on what other ID's are also under consideration.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So what does this mean? The way this random 
      targeting algorithm is implemented right now, if you happen to have an 
      InstanceID that hashes to an early position, you will tend to be attacked 
      more than your fair share when the creature is using random targeting, 
      regardless of your distance from the creature. In other words, you are Wi-Flagged.”
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We're glad we were finally able to fix this 
      bug. With the July Event, may you know peace in the fast-spawning dungeon 
      of your choice! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second issue will, in some ways, be 
      both more troubling and more inconsequential for players. HeartSeeker does 
      not affect missile launchers. It never has. Bows, crossbows, and atlatls 
      get no benefit from the HeartSeeker spell or from innate attack bonuses 
      (such as those found on the Singularity Bow). The only variables that 
      determine whether a missile character hits their target is their bow/xbow/tw 
      skill, the missile defense of the target, and where they set their 
      accuracy meter while they are attacking. However, the Defender spell, as 
      well as innate defensive bonuses, do work on missile launchers. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The <i>AC </i>Live team has been aware of 
      this for the last several months. Once we knew the situation, the question 
      became what to do about it. Should we “fix” an issue that probably isn't 
      broken? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Almost no archer/atlatler complains about 
      not being able to hit their target. They have a built in “HeartSeeker” all 
      the time. If anything, most monsters' missile defense scores have 
      historically been so low that many players regard archery as the fastest 
      way to level a character up through the first 30-40 levels. We did not 
      feel that “fixing” such a system would improve the game balance for anyone 
      in <i>Asheron's Call</i>, archer or no. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ultimately, we decided to resolve the 
      situation through our changes to the treasure system this month. From now 
      on, missile launchers will have a chance of having an innate defensive 
      bonus, but not an offensive one. While many old quest weapons still retain 
      their (useless) attack bonus, we will not be putting any new ones into the 
      system. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As we said, this news may seem 
      inconsequential to many players; however, once we determined the proper 
      solution, we did want everyone to know why we were making these changes.

    This is the latest installment of a frequently updated series of reports on 
    The State of the Code for Asheron's Call. In this report, we keep players 
    informed as to the state of some of the more technical aspects of AC, 
    particularly bugs we are working on and technical limitations of which you 
    should be aware. Look at the News page on the Zone for other articles about 
    recent additions and changes to Asheron's Call. <br>
    <br>
    <b>July Event Update </b><br>
    There were a number of bugs that we fixed with the July Hotfix. The most 
    important of these was a bug in which players could tinker armor and weapons 
    far beyond the normal ranges for these items. This bug was so potentially 
    disastrous to the balance of the game that we had to rollback the servers to 
    right before the July Event. We apologize for the inconvenience. Here is a 
    list of other bugs that we fixed, and a list of bugs that we are aware of, 
    but will not be fixed until August: <br>
    <br>
    <b>Items fixed in July's Hotfix </b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Any landscape dwelling sold in June had 
      been inadvertently &quot;turned off&quot; such that a player could not buy or pay 
      maintenance on one of these houses. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Unarmed weapons were not spawning with any 
      attack or defense bonuses. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Salvaged goods now sell for their correct 
      rates. There had been a bug in which they were selling for far, far less 
      than their true worth. <br>
      Deadly Atlatl darts now no longer erroneously require the bow skill to 
      wield. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There had been a bug in the covassal/allegiance 
      chat in which the name of the speaker was lopped off from the beginning of 
      the message. This has been fixed. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a bug in which the Singularity 
      Dungeon had not been made no_login, as was mentioned in this month's 
      Developer's Notes. This has now been fixed. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Items that will be fixed in August</b></font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Non-magic gems can currently not be 
      salvaged. This will be fixed in August. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">We have reports that deleting spells from 
      your spellbook can cause your client to crash. We have been unable to 
      repro this, and will try to fix for August. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Materials and gem types display improperly 
      when identifying an item. This will be fixed in August.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">T</span>here are two 
      minor bugs with the Shimmering weapons. The Shimmering Crossbow has an 
      incorrect Slayer property, and the Shimmering Atlatl is named a Shimmering 
      Axe. Both bugs will be fixed in August. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Material Value Bug </b><br>
    Salvaged materials retain a portion of the value of the items that were 
    salvaged to create the material. So, as an example, if you have a Salvaged 
    Gold made from two items--a Gold Tachi that was worth 4,678 py and a Gold 
    Yumi that was worth 1,234 py--then the Salvaged Gold might be worth 2,398 py. 
    When you sell this Salvaged Gold to a vendor, you would expect to collect 
    nearly all of that 2,398 py, depending on the vendor's buy rate. 
    Unfortunately, there is currently a bug that causes the vendors to pay a 
    mere 10 py or so for salvaged materials. Basically, salvaged materials are 
    considered stackables, and the value of a stackable comes from the &quot;unit 
    value&quot; quality instead of from the normal &quot;value&quot; quality. Salvaged 
    materials have the proper &quot;value,&quot; but an erroneous &quot;unit value.&quot; This leads 
    the value of a salvaged material to display correctly, but means that 
    vendors will not actually pay that price. <br>
    <br>
    Because this bug does not affect the primary purpose of tinkering, we will 
    not be hot-fixing it. It will, however, be fixed in the next regularly 
    scheduled monthly update. So, if you collect expensive salvaged materials 
    this month, you can sell them next month for nearly face value. </font></p>

	Now he lies mortally wounded in his castle, the life slowly draining out of 
	him. What will become of the world if Asheron falls? Even the insane 
	Martine, a man those on the fringes of society proclaimed to be a hero of 
	the Isparian people, was driven into catatonia when it was revealed he had 
	been Gaerlan's pawn. And this Gaerlan, an Empyrean bent on Asheron's 
	destruction, how has he returned to Dereth and why does he hate Asheron? Yet 
	in the minds of the Isparians, one question rises above all others: can High 
	Queen Elysa and her people resist Gaerlan and his Elemental army?</p>
	<p>Our latest event, <i>Repercussions</i>, opened Thursday, July 18. Find

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says</font>: 
      Welcome to the monthly Asheron's Call 1.0 Developer Chat. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> My name is Ken Karl, the 
      Producer at Microsoft for Asheron's Call 1.0. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> And no, for those of you 
      who have asked, I have not died <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I have simply been 
      traveling the world a lot over the past 1.5 months. I hope to start my 
      regular visits back on the fansites very soon <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Before we begin, I have a 
      few VERY important announcements to make <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> First, I want to remind 
      everyone that this chat is JUST for Asheron's Call 1.0. No questions about 
      AC2 will be taken <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>That said, I have one 
      piece of news about AC2 that will make most of you very happy <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Starting about 2 hours 
      ago, we started the invitation process to the AC2 beta for all the 
      remaining AC1 players that will in the snapshot we took back in May. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Yep, thats right, you are 
      finally ALL being let in (unless of course you were not in this snapshot, 
      in which case, you will have to wait just a few more weeks till we go into 
      open beta). <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Later tonight or tomorrow 
      you will receive your invitation to the AC2 Beta Community. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Then, about 1 or two days 
      later, you will receive your account information and where to download the 
      program... Then... you will be helping to make the next great MMORPG! <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>On the lines of AC2, we 
      are also ramping up the AC2 Live team. Much like AC1, we will have a 
      dedicated team to monthly updates. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>You may notice that Mr Ken 
      Troop is not with us this evening. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> That is because Ken Troop 
      is officially moved over to the AC2 Live team as the Producer <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I too will be joining Ken 
      as the Producer from Microsoft. We are very excited about taking 
      everything we have learned from Asheron's Call 1.0 Live process and using 
      it to make a stronger AC2 Live team <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Also joining Ken and 
      myself will be Kim Payson as Lead Designer <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Now fear not, AC1 is not 
      going away. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Quite the contrary as you 
      can see with the last few months props and what is to follow, we intend to 
      keep going strong. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>So with that in mind, I 
      would like to introduce you to the new Producer at Turbine for Asheron's 
      Call 1.0, Tim Holman. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Tim comes from VR1 where 
      he worked on both console and online games, including Tides of War, Hired 
      Guns, Nomads of Klanth, EmailSoccer, and Lost Continents, a pulp-era 
      MMORPG currently in development. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Please take a moment to 
      welcome Tim to the team. Initiation will begin in 1 week <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> One final announcement 
      before I turn it over to Tim for other introductions, The August Prop is 
      scheduled for Thursday. WOOT! <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Now, Tim can tell us who 
      else is with us this evening. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says: </font>Sorry folks, small tech 
      problem Greetings to all! I'm very excited to join the AC Live team and 
      continue the delivery of quality content you've all come to expect - being 
      a long time player of AC, this is a dream come true. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> I've been a fan of AC since 
      it's launch and while I have only been here one week, the talent and 
      dedication of the team amazes me. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99"><br>
      MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> OK sorry about going slow to begin with, we have 
      some rude people spamming questions <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>But, we just banned them 
      from the chat and AC.. they won't be a problem any longer. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Now, on to the questions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> Ken Karl, solver of 
      problems <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">lrdka in AsheronsCall asks:</font> What was the 
      armor that was in the teaser pics?? As in AL and quest or loot gen. stuff?
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>Well, we don't want to 
      give away too much about upcoming content, but I can tell you that 1) this 
      armor drops as loot, and 2) it looks *really* nice. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Ultimatus2 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>What ever 
      happened to the extra storage for dwelling? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> While extra storage is 
      something we always have and still want to do, in adding in Residential 
      Quarters and other features for housing, we discovered some issues that 
      make it not quite as easy as we had first hoped it would be. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Those problems basically 
      would result in extremely bad performance across all of Dereth. While we 
      still want to do this, it is unlikely that it will every be added at this 
      point. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">ChyEld in AsheronsCall asks: </font>How about some 
      info on Magic Tinkering. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> I get all the tough 
      questions tonight. *grin* <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> So, no detials -- you'll 
      find them out soon enough. But a few comments to whet your appetite: the 
      first three Magic Item Tinkering effects are what we've been calling 
      'weapon imbuing'. You can apply these to melee and missile weapons, and 
      two of them can <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> be applied to magic 
      casters (wands and orbs). <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> The three effects are: 
      Critical Strike, which let's you critical more often; Crippling Blow, 
      which let's you critical for more damage; and Armor Rending, which let's 
      your weapon ignore some portion of your opponents armor. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> It's important to note 
      that the power of these effects, once they've been imbued into a weapon, 
      depend on the skill level of the weapon's wielder. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">exaMagus in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will you ever 
      open a new pvp server? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> There are no plans on 
      adding a new PvP server. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">STRONGJ25 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Concerning 
      pvp: What changes in the near future are taking place with War dmg, Hollow 
      arrows, and Fast Casting <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> Well, we are making 
      several PvP changes this month. For starters, there will be a logout timer 
      for PK to making it harder to flee from combat... <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>We are also adding the 
      normal portal recall delays to Portal Sending spells and Portal Sending 
      gems... <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> Next month also sees 
      further changes to Hollow weapons to help melee PvPs... <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>And there are some 
      projectile spell changes which I'm sure will come up later that should 
      address some mage concerns. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> These changes are all in 
      for August, and these timer changes only effect PK players on all worlds.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Gothor_X in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will Quiddity 
      weapons get upgraded like Singularity weapons were once ? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>At this point in time we 
      have no plans to adjust quiddity weapons. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> But as stated in previous 
      chats, we are looking over many quests items for adjustment in the future.
      <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">bigmikeCR01 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> How many 
      more mansions do u guys plan on adding, as i hear dereth is running out of 
      room? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Over the next few months 
      we will only be adding Residential Quarters. Come October, we will analyze 
      the housing picture, how much room is left on the landscape and how many 
      houses/RQs are available, then determine if/when we will add more housing.

      <font color="#FFFF99">sun_tzu000 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Any details 
      on the upcoming War spell Economy that you can share with us? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Well, for starters the 
      old economy is not coming back. What will will have is a skill based 
      damage bonus for mages. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Basically the higher your 
      skill the more damage potential you will have. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">M_a_C1 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will the issue 
      with greaves ever be addressed? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Yes. <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Oh .. err .. you want 
      more? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>Okay .. in August, you 
      will begin finding upper leg armor in loot. It's a little strange in some 
      ways -- there were some graphics engine issues we had to work around, but 
      it works. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">NATHAN_538 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will the 
      protect Gems the 2 lugie vendors sell be fixed, last time I used one, it 
      gave only 15 min. instead of 30 <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>Yes, the Lugian 
      Gemsellers' gems have increased duration in August. So does Arcane 
      Restoration and Unnatural Persistance. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Zifadel in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will we be 
      seeing a change to banes at any time soon? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Yes, banes will be 
      changed to cap at 2.0 in August. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">nacoomer in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Are there ever 
      gonna be any hangable portals for houses? <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Eventually. This is 
      something we've wanted for awhile now, and we still plan on doing it, but 
      it's not quite ready yet. <br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Mike_15_UK in AsheronsCall asks:</font> whats with 
      the new Arc spells? give us some info ! <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> These spells are the same 
      casting cost and damage as normal war bolts... <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>but they travel in an 
      arching path similar to the way arrows travel...<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> the are also special in 
      that they don't track like normal spells. Instead of leading the target 
      they aim at the exact location the target is standing when the spell 
      fires.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>They can be fairly 
      helpful when fighting on uneven terrain though.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Diane657 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>What happened 
      to that idea of a &quot;high level playground&quot;?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>Well the first touch was 
      the obsidian plains.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>They got a little tougher 
      this last patch.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> However, the alteration 
      and addition will not end there. We have plans for more in the future.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Crimson_SC in AsheronsCall asks:</font> How will the 
      new hollow arrows work?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Unfortunately, hollow 
      arrows are trickier to implement than we had first thought.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>We wanted to get them in 
      this month, but they just aren't ready yet. We hope to have them ready 
      soon, however.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Brave_Phoebus in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will we 
      see the implementation of armor ignoring hollows anytime in the future?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">razius in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will dagger 
      loose triple strike this coming patch?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>At this point, we have 
      not yet made a final decision about triple-strike dagger. We are still 
      considering various options.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>So no, there are no 
      changes to triple-strike dagger this month.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">kenshinowns in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Are we 
      going to see new Dye pots at the Shadow Armor Vendors?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Nope.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>There are plans for some 
      quest items to become dyeable in the future.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MYLMiddie13 in AsheronsCall asks:</font> 
      Fastcasting..it staying or going?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> For those who don't know, 
      fast casting is an exploit that allows players to cast spells faster than 
      intended.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>This exploit is possible 
      due to the limitations of our animation system.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> While we cannot remove 
      those limitation, we are making a change that will limit fastcasting.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Starting next month there 
      will be server-side timing on how fast you can cast spells.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>This timer should be 
      completely unnoticable to normal players.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: O</font>nly those who were using 
      fastcasting should even notice it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">chillen_AC in 
      AsheronsCall asks: </font>People have been able to appear to log, and turn 
      invisible and invulnerable, This a bug or some glitch?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>So while folks can still 
      use animation breaking techniques to cast a single spell faster they will 
      not obtain much benefit.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Well, it *was* a bug.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> It should be fixed with 
      the August update.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MercilessHunter in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will we 
      only be able to imbue an item once, or will i be able to imbue my weapon 
      with critical strike, crippling blow and armor rending<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says:</font> Ah, I should have 
      mentioned that before.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">srand_Turbine says: </font>You can only imbue a 
      weapon once. So you only get one effect per weapon, and you can't change 
      it once you've chosen. Choose carefully.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Just an off topic comment 
      real quick:<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>There have been a lot of 
      questions here and elsewhere about where I have snuck off too and why I am 
      not posting on the boards as much.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I wanted to assure 
      everyone that I shall return.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> In starting some 
      transition to AC2 as well as AC1, I have been traveling quite a bit lately 
      (heck, I seem to never be here anymore). I spent more time in Boston then 
      Redmond <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I will be taking a 
      vacation at the end of this week for one week, and then after that, I 
      shall be back for at least one whole month (WOO HOO!).<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I intend to pop back on 
      the boards then and catch up as best as I can.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> I will start a thread as 
      normal on Patch Day for Patch Day questions only.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>I will answer some of the 
      questions and Tim will fill in for me.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Then when I return, I will 
      dive into some of the off topic Qs (such as the big thread waiting for me 
      about life magic <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Just wanted to assure 
      everyone that I shall return lol.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>Ok, back to the program.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">brk_it_dwn in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will The 
      Glowing Trees on ML ever be given a purpose?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Actually the trees on 
      Marae Lassel have a very real purpose.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> There are three of them.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>They each speak on things 
      that have either come to pass, possibly that are happening now, or things 
      that could come to be.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>The trick is to ready 
      into what they say.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">firecross in AsheronsCall asks:</font> Will their be 
      deadly hollow katar staff or dagger?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says: </font>Staff, Unarmed, and 
      Dagger will also see hollow weapon upgrades this month, including the 
      addition of deadly hollows.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">KKehl22 in AsheronsCall asks: </font>What has 
      happened to the &quot;Bunny Master&quot; Quest? Larry is gone for good?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Funny you should ask.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> We may have finally found 
      why Larry wanders off so often.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says: </font>That being said, we want 
      to make sure that when we make the fix that he never leaves again.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> So it will be a while 
      longer.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>OK, and as normal, we 
      shall end out chat with the completely worthless, why did they ask that 
      question to end our chat.....<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">LordPetkov in AsheronsCall asks: </font>Will Ken 
      wear a boobie dress to the premiere of AC2?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> I vote, Yes!<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Tim_Turbine says:</font> You mean apart from the 
      everyday boobie dress?<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Sean_Turbine says:</font> *shudders at the thought*<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Toddb_Turbine says:</font> I'd pay a dollar to point 
      and laugh at that.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> Oh man, you would not want 
      to see that picture... but just imagine me imagine me in a female Tumerok 
      Armor Piece... with an attachable Tail... yeah.. that would be cool.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says:</font> OK, with that, we come to 
      the closure of another Developer's Chat.<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Spd_turbine says: </font>Yeah, we will make him<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">MrQuazarr_MS says: </font>We thank you all for 
      ocming<br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Orion_Turbine says:</font> Good night everyone!<br>
