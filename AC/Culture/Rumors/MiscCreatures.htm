	the World</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">--Blue Orb Sayings</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer 
	tells you, &quot;Ah, this bauble was created by the Imperial Talespinner Mistral 
	Tersicor. For many years he wandered the world, recording the stories of all 
	its peoples.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;He disappeared from the palace at Tentael one 
	cold night, just after Caerlin II had taken the throne. He left a note, 
	saying that the songs of other worlds needed to be written, and that he 
	would return in 2300 years.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi prods the orb gently. It blossoms, the blue surfaces spiraling open 
	to reveal patches of green, brown, and white. <br>
	</font><br>
	--Blue Orb Sayings</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;This golem has 
	already unlocked one of Mistral's spheres for you recently, young master. 
	Come back in a week.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;This golem was 
	provided with the essence of the old master, and remembers. Yes, it does. He 
	would not leave the world bereft of story.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">For a moment, Eaushi's fissure-eyes twinkle a merry 
	sea blue.</font></p>
	<p>--Geode Sayings</p>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;It is rare to gain 
	such a prize from the Nephol Golems, young master. This geode is said to 
	indicate much favor. Perhaps you were born under Irihane ascendant?&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;No this golem does not feel the influence of 
	any lights it knows upon you. How odd.&quot;</font></p>
	<p>--Boots of the Vault Sayings</p>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;These bring back 
	memories. These boots were the property of Marr Areleo, one of the Exarchs 
	of the Order.&quot; </font>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;He and his brother 
	were responsible for patrolling certain... storehouses, ensuring they 
	remained safely under lock and key.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;This task was given 
	to them by Caerlin I, at the behest of the mage Asheron.&quot; </font></p>
	<p>--Lightweight Tome Sayings</p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, 
	&quot;This book was crafted by Rurinah, a member of the last class of students 
	here. She was quite skilled in the art of parchment-making.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;The process had been passed through her 
	family for generations. She was proud to note that her grandmother had made 
	paper for the esteemed Maila of Knorr.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;This servant recalls her well - a terribly 
	serious silver-haired girl, given to calling more lighthearted people 
	'fools.'&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">--Sasalia's Dress Sayings</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Eaushi the Trainer tells you, 
	&quot;This was once worn by the mage Sasalia, who became one of our instructors. 
	In addition to the combat arts, Sasalia was also a master of culinary 
	magic.&quot; <br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;An unusual combination for a Hieromancer. She 
	often cooked for the students.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	Eaushi the Trainer tells you, &quot;She had a rather peculiar pet, too. When she 
	was a girl attending this school, it would sit on her head during classes.&quot;
