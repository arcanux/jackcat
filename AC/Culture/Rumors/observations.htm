	<font size="2" face="arial">Initial observations, Entity: &quot;Har<span lang="en-us">r</span>aag&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The entity that calls itself &quot;Harraag&quot; seems to have adapted to be neither 
	rejection nor mutation of either &quot;energy source&quot; used in its empowerment. &quot;Harraag&quot; 
	has retained most of its original mental capabilities, despite hopes that 
	the entity would develop proficiency in the manipulation of Mana. All of the 
	capability to do so is there, and there is ample evidence that the entity's 
	base species possesses such abilities. Further study may be necessary before 
	the process can be considered complete.<br>
	<br>
	Also, the entity has maintained its original &quot;soul&quot;, with little evidence of 
	the essence placed within it. This will also require further study. </font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Entity o<span lang="en-us">b</span>servations, 
	post-release:<br>
	<br>
	Entity Harraag immediately set to following the compulsions implanted in its 
	grey matter when released. The entity immediately made contact with those of 
	its species, and began to sway them to follow it, largely through brute 
	force. Resistance to this conversion seems very high, but that seems to be 
	the nature of the entity's base species. The entity's progress will be 
	monitored from a discreet distance.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Entry 2, Entity Haraag [sic]: <br>
	<br>
	The entity continues to meet great resistance. Though physically greater in 
	power than the base species, they seem reluctant to accept the entity's 
	dominance. The species seems highly resistant to following any being 
	perceived as different from or from outside their species. This seems to 
	apply to Entity Harraag as well. <br>
	<br>
	The base species has managed to put the entity in a defensive position, by 
	gathering large numbers together to drive it off. The Observers have 
	dispatched some Rifts to aid the entity, as its loss would be a significant 
	setback, even if the entity itself is a failure. </font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Entry 3, Entity Haraag [sic]:<br>
	<br>
	The entity has retreated to a physical cave, and, surprisingly, &quot;ripped a 
	hole into Portalspace*&quot; in which to escape. Though the method was crude, the 
	capacity to create such a passage shows that there is more power in the 
	entity than originally calculated. Perhaps a portion of the essence invested 
	into the entity has finally exerted itself.<br>
	<br>
	The entity continues to obey our compulsion, but with less success than 
	anticipated. Were it not for its demonstrated ability to manipulate 
	fluctuations in portal energy, the creation would be classified as a 
	failure. As extreme stress was the catalyst for the increase in ability, the 
	entity will be left in these adverse conditions for the time being, and 
	continue to be observed.<br>
	<br>
	* Translator's Note: There is no clean translation for this statement, but 
	it seems to imply the expenditure of an immense level of power.</font></p>
