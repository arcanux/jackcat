    <td valign="top" width="436"><p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small>Here
    are some of the historic organizations known to have existed in the homelands of the
    Aluvians. How will these groups - and other groups not written of here - fare in the new
    land of Dereth? Your actions will doom some to the dull dust of obscurity, and raise
    others to the fiery glow of fame.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>The King&#146;s Men</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: &quot;King above all.&quot;</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: This is an alliance of some
    nobles and commoners who believe the king, as a descendent of High King Pwyll, should do
    away with the Aluvian feudal system of government (the Laws of Rulership) and seize direct
    control. They believe the king&#146;s wisdom should prevail in all matters.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Though none of the immediate Aluvian
    royal family has appeared in the world, believers in the reign of High King Pwyll are
    staunch supporters of Queen Elysa Strathelar. Should the King&#146;s Men be re-formed in
    Dereth, they would surely fight to bring her reign over the entire island.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>Knights of the Golden
    Flame</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: &quot;Let Justice reign.&quot;</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: This is the old knighthood of
    Aluvia. They are trained from an early age to be the judges and caretakers of the kingdom.
    Members of this group travel the land and offer their services as impartial judges in
    disputes. They also try to help those in need and right what they consider wrong.
    Membership is by invitation only. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Queen Elysa Strathelar has made it
    known that she wishes the Knights of the Golden Flame to be official knights of her realm.
    However, because so few original Knights have arrived in Dereth, how this might become
    reality is still in question.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>Knights of the Shield</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: Unknown</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: Among the knighthood of Aluvia,
    there is a growing faction of those who are dissatisfied with the king&#146;s justice, and
    feel that the knights should be given more power, above and beyond the current laws. A few
    secretly formed the Knights of the Shield, in order to better render their own justice
    upon the land. The Knights of the Golden Flame are officially at war against these
    secretive, renegade knights. However, rumors say that some Knights of the Golden Flame are
    actually double agents.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: What happens with the Knights of the
    Shield in Dereth is unknown.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>Order of the Gauntlet</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: &quot;Justice is bought with
    blood.&quot;</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: On the opposite end of the
    spectrum from the Knights of the Shield is the Order of the Gauntlet. These knights
    believe that no one should be exempt from the king&#146;s justice; the rule of law must be
    absolute if order is to be maintained. The justice of the Gauntlet is untempered by mercy
    or circumstance, and they spend a great deal of their time hunting down and slaying those
    who have committed crimes and escaped what the Order considers sufficient penalty. As
    such, the Order is highly secretive.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: It is thought the Order &#150; or
    something like it - may be resurrected in Dereth, due to the need for harsh and strict
    justice. The love of a stern and unyielding justice is not an uncommon trait, after all.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>League of Merchants</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: &quot;Free and fair trade for
    all.&quot;</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: This group was formed to help
    protect the merchant class from the nobility. Its primary concern is with the protection
    of its members and the making of profit. Members are required to pay a due, and only
    people who meet approval can join. The League of Merchants formed a formidable network of
    trading partners throughout Aluvia.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Here in Dereth, merchants in general
    have been seriously hampered by a lack of customers, dangerous conditions, and low
    resources. Still, the new world is a great opportunity for commerce. Should the League
    become established in Dereth, surely establishment of safe pathways to other Heritage
    Groups&#146; lands, whether by road or by portal, will become a top priority.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small><strong>Scholars of Pwyll</strong></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Motto: &quot;Knowledge is that which
    brings wisdom.&quot;</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Background: This group of sages and artists
    are dedicated to continuing the traditions of scholarly research and artistic exploration
    begun by High King Pwyll. They seek to share information among themselves and protect
    valuable texts and knowledge. Their exclusive library of mystical knowledge is famous
    throughout Aluvia. Prospective members must have a sponsor within the Guild to join.</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Now, old magics no longer work, and
    few of their old Aluvian texts have made the passage through Portalspace. Perhaps a new
    group of Scholars will form and re-create the traditions of their predecessors.<br>
