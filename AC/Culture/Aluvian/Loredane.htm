    <td valign="top" width="436"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><em>This story
    is from a parchment that was found in Dereth:</em></small></font></p>
    <font size="3"><p align="justify"></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">To: Benton L.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Read this carefully, my friend! I have found a
    secret beyond imagination. Make sure that no one else hears of this. Remember, I trust you
    to be discreet. Someone of your ability and intelligence will surely understand the
    serious nature of this letter.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Ever since my arrival in Dereth, I had been plagued
    &#150; or blessed? &#150; by dreams. In the night, a voice whispers to me of blood and
    glory, seizing me fast in cords of strange and pleasing agony. I awake shaking in fear,
    but in my innermost heart, I am rejoicing.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For a long time I wondered if I were mad. Everything
    forbidden became tempting. At last, I could see no more reason to resist. I gave in to the
    call, and then I found the cords that bound me in the dreams became silken and sweet,
    until they seemed like a second skin, and I even forgot they were there. My dreams became
    veritable glimpses of a paradise in which what I wished for became mine, no matter what it
    may be. And then I heard more and more that distant voice bidding me to travel &#150; to
    travel west, from the safe expanses of Osteth, into the dangerous Direlands.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I hesitated only briefly. Though not the most
    doughty of men, I took up my sword and armor, hired a few discreet stout mercenaries, and
    I traveled west. I shall not bore you with my journey.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At last I crossed over into the Direlands. Avoiding
    the savage tumeroks &#150; alas, that my new dream-master did not enslave them as
    thoroughly as he did me &#150; I slipped through the parched and desolate lands, guided
    only by the increasing dark joy in my heart.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I have been bound by oath to not reveal the exact
    path I took, but I can tell you this: I arrived at last in a certain underground cavern,
    ancient and majestic, built by the Empyrean long ago. Into it I delved. The suffering I
    experienced was both terrible and wondrous at the same time. Perhaps the best and worst
    was when I was forced to kill the last of my hired companions &#133; but that story can
    wait.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Deep in the heart of that place, I found Him. He was
    waiting for me there, and He enfolded me into His darkness. There, I learned much. I
    learned of how He was the Lord of this world, the Master of Shadows, the immortal and
    unchanging Hopeslayer: Bael&#146;Zharon in the tongue of the Empyrean. I bowed down before
    him, trembling in terror and delight.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Much more he told me &#150; things that I dare not
    divulge to you until I have searched your heart and have found its weaknesses for myself.
    But I came away with knowledge of how to break some of the magical bonds upon those who
    arrive here in Dereth. I spoke of killing my hired companion. You know, as I do, how some
    powerful magic had stolen the ability to harm others from us: the terrible curse of
    Asheron, that cowardly wizard who hides in secrecy. But Bael&#146;Zharon has found a way
    to free us of some of those entangling laws. He has given us freedom &#150; a freedom that
    even Asheron must admit is deserved by all humans: the freedom to harm each other as we
    will. The very fundamental aspect of a living soul, that which Asheron would deny us.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It is unfortunate that Bael&#146;Zharon&#146;s
    freedom is given only to a few, and that Asheron&#146;s chains cannot be removed from all
    humans who walk in Dereth. Yet, it is like a breath of fresh, cool air. It clears the head
    and removes foolish notions of safety. We are free beings, with the ability to kill each
    other and to delight in such things.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Thus, you see, Bael&#146;Zharon is not just the
    Hopeslayer. He slays only the sad delusional hopes of those who would rule us with foolish
    laws. Instead, to us, He is the Hopegiver. He gives us the hope of a world without
    Asheron&#146;s chains. His bonds are, instead, silken and delightful, feeding our every
    desire, giving us all that we want. Desire-granter, Dream-fulfiller, Power-giver: these
    are the names I give Him!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But I digress. Tell me, my good friend, of what your
    heart desires, and I shall see if Bael&#146;Zharon and myself shall be able to grant them.
    Be wary, though! Foul Asheron&#146;s allies are all around, those who embrace that
    illusionary peace. Did I mention that Asheron is a liar? Don&#146;t trust those deluded by
    him. Instead, come with me. I will show you what true glory is. The rewards are great.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Come talk to me, my friend. Remember that I trust
    you above all others. Do not tell anyone else of this!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Your friend,</font></p>
