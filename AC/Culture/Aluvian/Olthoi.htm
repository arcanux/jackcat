    <font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">Purchased from Minthada the 
    Librarian in Cragstone - 26.0N, 47.0E</font></span><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So
    who is this, that wishes to write down my tale of the dark days of when we were enslaved
    to the Olthoi? A historian? To make sure none of it is lost? A noble goal, though I should
    hope that, with only twenty years' history, there isn't much to lose yet. All right, then,
    I will speak slowly. You take care to write what I say without error. See that you miss
    nothing. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>My first memory is of stirring the pots. Big,
    stone-like vats that came up to my chin at the time. Soup pots, my mother called them, and
    it took me years of normal village life to come to think of simmering meat and vegetables
    as soup, instead of those grey-green vats of liquid stench. At least, I am told the soup
    pots smelled horrible. I myself cannot smell very well; I grew up in the midst of too much
    that smelled of Olthoi. Even now I can scarce tell you whether a fire burns nearby, or if
    the bread is scorched; neither can I smell the fields in flower. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So, then, soup pots were those containers of
    gruel that Olthoi would take to their grubs; the grubs, which we called white worms, would
    bathe in and consume it. I am sure you have heard this from other old-timers already. I
    didn't actually see very much of this, but I was told about it by braver and older souls
    who had managed to snatch quick glimpses. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I grew up stirring soup pots with rounded
    long stirring sticks. You see, if you left the gruel sit too long, it would grow a thick
    skin on top, which would not dissolve again. And if you left it far too long, it would
    grow fuzzy and turn strange colors - or so they said. So you had to watch carefully and
    stir often. For while the Olthoi tolerated some laziness, any failures were met with
    instant reprisal. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I remember seeing a woman who had fallen
    asleep beside her soup pot; something in the brew must have alerted the Olthoi, for they
    came swarming in with their claws swinging, and all I remember from there is a lot of
    blood. Such scenes were common, especially since we were so often exhausted. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, the Olthoi had no reason to treat us
    well, for many of us were still arriving into this world. We were an endless supply of
    labor for them. Some have questioned us, saying we could not have done so much work for a
    creature that cannot speak to us or order us about. Yet, I tell you, we learned. And once
    a few of us had learned what to do to please our masters, we quickly taught it to the
    newcomers, lest they be killed immediately. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Of course, many newcomers still tried to
    fight, and they met a quick and bloody end. And any bodies were added to the soup pots.
    The only fortunate thing amidst all of this is that the Olthoi had no taste for fresh meat
    itself, despite rumors to the contrary. Thus we were spared becoming like cattle. Instead,
    we were slaves. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Thus we were like men enslaved by monstrous
    ants. You have probably heard that before, too. The irony is apparently worse for those
    who remember our homelands clearly. My mother, after her freeing, could no longer abide
    the sight of ants. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>She delighted to step on them, especially the
    big black ones, to spread their innards across the ground and to watch their legs and
    mandibles twitch helplessly and grow slowly more feeble. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Oh, of course you would wish to know about
    how we were freed. I must have been about five when Elysa Strathelar and Thorsten
    Cragstone finally brought us freedom. There had been rumors of a revolt for some time; I
    remember the adults murmuring about it amongst themselves. Oh yes, we could talk; it was a
    blessing that the Olthoi could not understand human speech, and did nothing to stop it
    unless it grew too loud. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But anyway, despite the rumors, news from
    outside was hard to come by, and the revolt itself must have taken many by surprise. I
    clearly recall the cheers and the screams when first the fighting reached us, when we
    first saw the fallen corpses of Olthoi and men together. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I remember a woman's voice shouting above the
    battle, exhorting the able-bodied to take up whatever weapons we could find and to stand
    against the Olthoi masters. I think it was the voice of Elysa Strathelar herself. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>And I also remember how there were some men
    and women dressed in gleaming armor, and wielding blades that glowed with magic. Whence
    those came from, I myself do not know, but I am sure you have heard rumors enough about
    that. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>My mother immediately joined the revolt. She
    snatched up a dagger from a fallen man and tied it to her stirring stick. I followed her
    through some long corridors until we came to a vast lake of gruel - or so it seemed to me
    - and I remember how she slit open every white worm she could reach, piercing them through
    and shredding them apart while she laughed and cried at the same time. Then she left me in
    the care of an older child, and she went running after the others. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>She later told me that she reached the
    deepest chamber of the Olthoi nest, where Elysa Strathelar and Thorsten Cragstone battled
    the giant Queen of the Olthoi. I have wished many times since that I could have seen that
    battle, but I do know I am glad I did not see the terrible and final blow that struck
    Thorsten Cragstone. That I am glad to have missed, and I wish it had never happened. But I
    did hear they fought valiantly, to make High King Pwyll himself proud. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, it is quite true that when the Queen of
    the Olthoi was slain, the entire Olthoi race was thrown into disorder. I saw our once
    intently watchful masters now running in mindless circles, or curled up and quivering upon
    their backs, or aimlessly cutting at empty air. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Of course they are not quite so mindless now,
    but they have never returned to their former intelligence since their Queen's death. So it
    was that back then, right after her demise, they were quite mad with confusion, and we
    could walk right past many with no harm, or kill them with relative ease. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But we survivors retrieved all the fallen
    human bodies that we could - we even pulled some decaying ones from the soup pots - and we
    carried or dragged them to the surface for proper burial. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>We came out into the open air at dawn; for
    some of us, it was the first real exposure to the above-ground world. Had my mother not
    described sunlight to me, surely I would have been just as terrified as some of the other
    children. But I remember standing in the brilliant light upon an open grassy field, just
    staring and staring and staring. Dreamlike, is the only way I can describe it. Like
    entering a whole new world. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Would I go to our homelands, to Aluvia, you
    ask? I should like to visit, if ever such a thing were to become possible. I have no
    memories of it at all, though my mother certainly told me of its wonders: the great
    cities, the vast seas. Yet I still remember the wondrous feeling of standing in that open
    field, blinking at that first dawn. And, of course, I have lived my entire life here,
    helping to fight off the beasts and settle the land. I think, perhaps, that I will stay
    here. </small></font></td>
