      <font size="2">
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">My dear historian, I must confess that I nearly sent
    your request back to you with a simple refusal.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yet, the more I reflected, the more it seemed
    somehow fitting that I should be the one to write about the vast halls known as the
    &quot;Underground City.&quot; I have a private name for it: &quot;Thorsten
    Cragstone&#146;s Tomb.&quot; However, he himself always called it the Underground City,
    even when only seven of us lived there!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So, then, here I will write for you the story of the
    Underground City.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Thorsten and I, with our tiny band of escaped
    slaves, came to the little island and its hidden city quite by accident. Olthoi had been
    following our scent for days, and we had crossed the river in the hopes of confusing them.
    Soon after, it was Thorsten who spotted a portal in the distance. Together, we plotted how
    we would lay our scent trails to confuse the Olthoi. After hours of painstaking
    back-tracking, all seven of us slipped into the portal, and we found ourselves on an
    island that we ascertained to be in the middle of Olthoi Lake. Then, too tired to explore
    further, and worried that our back-tracking would not be enough, we waited that night in
    tense anticipation of arriving Olthoi. But none came. We had lost them! Here on the
    island, protected on all sides by water, we would be safe, finally, from Olthoi patrols.
    Now we could rest, gather our strength, and plan for the future.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We soon set about exploring the island. That is when
    we found yet another portal amidst the trees. Hesitantly, Thorsten and I entered. We came
    out in a vast, cool, dark hall. At first we expected to hear the chittering of angry
    Olthoi, but we soon realized the still air lacked the characteristic smell of Olthoi. With
    growing excitement, we set about exploring the corridors. Even the darkest corners seemed
    to leap up with joy to see our torchlight. Room after room we found, complete with
    still-usable remnants of simple tables, beds, chairs; we found cooking areas and dining
    areas, and halls wide enough to keep livestock. Long ago, we guessed, people had lived
    here. Perhaps not the most wealthy of people, but people nonetheless. And where people had
    lived before, we could live now.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Thorsten could hardly contain his joy when we were
    at last satisfied that no other living creature moved within. &quot;An underground
    city!&quot; he shouted. &quot;A new capital for free humans, from where we can plot the
    overthrow of the Olthoi!&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So it was that we moved into the Underground City.
    Our numbers slowly grew, for we would sneak back to the mainland in search of other
    escaped slaves, then bring them back with us. In the City, we repaired the furniture that
    we found, or made our own. We explored the halls and gathered what weapons and tools we
    could. We stockpiled food and weapons. We trained our people in warfare. We began making
    plans.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Those were happy days, of laughter and song and
    hope. The laughter was strained, the song was born of desperation, and the hope too often
    tasted of madness, but nonetheless, we were living free. We spun illusory dreams about us
    as we talked: dreams of green pastures and running water, sturdy houses built upon sunlit
    hills &#133; and the walls of the Underground City seemed almost to lean toward us as if
    listening, as if delighted to hear the sounds of life and hope once more.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The rest of the story is already known, and I shall
    not repeat it. I will only write of what befell the halls of the Underground City after
    the Olthoi were finally vanquished.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Thorsten&#146;s body we brought back to the
    Underground City, which for so long had been our shelter, fortress, and home. The coffin
    we laid in a chamber fit for a king&#146;s final resting place.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">For some reason, I had thought the Underground City
    would become what it had once obviously been: a bustling city of people. For awhile, it
    was almost such. But I was, in the end, wrong. Few who remembered the horror of Olthoi
    enslavement wanted to continue living underground. And once a few houses had been built
    upon the land, under the bright sky, and once I had slept in a bed by a window and had
    awoken to sunlight upon my face, I knew that I, too, could no longer live in the darkness.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Long days have passed since then, since
    Thorsten&#146;s passing&#133;.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I believe that Thorsten&#146;s soul is now free;
    that he is elsewhere now, perhaps even at High King Pwyll&#146;s side. Olthoi Lake is now
    known as Lake Blessed; the island is now called the Isle of Tears. Thorsten even has a
    town named for him, right on the shores of Lake Blessed. But it still pains me when I hear
    of what has become of his burial place, the Underground City. For years it lay abandoned
    once more. Reports came that monsters had taken up residence within it. I sent soldiers to
    clear it, but soon after this was done, new monsters moved in.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And so it is even now. Some people have asked my
    leave to try to live there, but most of them have since given up. I believe a handful
    still survive there, but I have not had the liberty to go see for myself. Indeed, I am too
    busy tending to other matters: the affairs of state, of a land of rolling green pastures
    and running water, of sturdy houses built upon sunlit hills.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So, that is the story of the Underground City. I
    trust you to see that this story, and others like it, are not lost.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Finally, I say to you: seek the City out if you wish
    to; bow in respect at Thorsten Cragstone&#146;s tomb. Remember the sacrifices of the past,
    but more importantly, remember the promises of the future. </font></p>
