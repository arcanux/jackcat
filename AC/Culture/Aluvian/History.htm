    <td valign="top" width="423"><font face="Arial"><small><em>Aluvians</em> are a fiercely
    individualistic and warlike people, quick to anger but with a strong love of justice and
    fairness. Though often suspicious of things new and strange, they are friendly and always
    prepared with a little help if they can spare it. They are loyal to their feudal lords,
    but expect to be well-treated in return.<br>
    <br>
    The first people to arrive on Dereth Island, the <em>Aluvians</em>,&nbsp; have settled in
    the fields and hills around Lake Blessed.</small></font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>HISTORY</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    In olden days, the land now known as the High Kingdom of Aluvia was home to feuding clans
    of warriors. Seeking conquest, the neighboring nation of Viamont invaded and instated a
    king, Alfric I, to rule over the clan chiefs. The native <em>Aluvians</em> rebelled, but
    with little success; subject to often brutal reprisals, they remained thralls of a foreign
    monarch. That changed, however, with the coronation of High King Osric. Though a Viamonter
    by birth, Osric dedicated his reign to mending his divided country. He made peace with the
    rebellious nobles, lowered backbreaking taxes, and even named his son after an Aluvian
    saint, Pwyll. To this day, folk sing the praises of Osric the Wise.<br>
    <br>
    By the time of the rule of Pwyll III, the peoples of Aluvia had united as one, prospering
    under the High King&#146;s kind and just reign. Pwyll III banded together the
    kingdom&#146;s knights, forming an order of honor and chivalry, and so began a golden age.
    When he was slain by a treacherous ambassador from Viamont on the eve of war between the
    two nations, Aluvia&#146;s knights and commoners alike fell upon their enemies and
    destroyed them. With Pwyll&#146;s death, Aluvia&#146;s glory began to wane, but it is said
    that, when the kingdom is at its greatest need, he and his knights will walk the land once
    more. <br>
    <br>
    Aluvia remains a strong nation, though it shines less brightly than before. Good king
    Cedraic has opened up trade with nations across the sea including the Gharu&#146;ndim and
    the Sho and with that trade has come prosperity. To the west, however, Viamont bides: it
    will only be a matter of time, some say, before war returns to the land.<br>
    <br>
    When the first <em>Aluvians</em> came to Dereth Island, they were enslaved by the vicious
    Olthoi. Two of their number, the warrior Thorsten Cragstone and the lady Elysa Strathelar,
    fought to liberate their people with the help of the mysterious sorcerer Asheron. Though
    Thorsten did not live to see the end of the campaign, the <em>Aluvians</em> are now free
    once more. Though this new land is strange to them, they have made it their home. In time,
    it is said, a new High King will rise to rule them like wise Osric and noble Pwyll.<br>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>THE CODE OF
    PWYLL</strong></font><br>
    One of Pwyll III&#146;s greatest achievements was introducing the notion of nobility to
    the ruling class. In his time and since, the Code of Pwyll has dictated the conduct of
    both lords and knights: the common folk of Aluvia have come to expect no less. These
    tenets of honor are as follows:</small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>1. Work your lord&#146;s will in all things.<br>
    2. Guard the weak. <br>
    3. Protect the young. <br>
    4. Slay no one for doing a thing unto you that you would have done unto him. <br>
    5. Obey and honor those above your station. <br>
    6.</small><font size="2"> Do not mistreat those of lesser station</font><small><br>
    7. Let your word be your bond. <br>
    8. Grant succor where you may. <br>
    9. Be fair in all judgments. <br>
    10. Let nothing stand in the way of justice: the word of the law is not always its intent.</small></font>
