					of the world to come are suggested by their relentless and 
					indiscriminate hate? Sho tradition holds that magicians who 
					bargained with demons sometimes rose after death (in times 
					when death was permanent), but the occurrence was reportedly 
					rare, and the undead are not unplentiful in Dereth these 
					days. The sorcerer-scribe Ardivan Locke, son of the famous 
					explorer Alatar Locke, claims to have bound a lich and 
					forced it to speak on these matters. Though his interview 
					was not conclusive, he gathers that the undead corpses 
					generally house evil spirits and not human souls at all. He 
					could get no answer as to what these spirits are, nor could 
					he determine how or why they inhabit the bodies of men, but 
					he suspects the work of Bael'Zharon. &nbsp; <br>

			<font color="#FFFFFF">Many sorcerers believe the undead derive 
			vitality from a common pool of magic. Ardivan guesses that when 
			Bael'Zharon resurrects his faithful, he siphons some life force from 
			them and sends it to this pool. The scribe has been quick to add, 
			however, that he cannot yet support his ideas with evidence. </font>

			Though death is seldom permanent for humans in Dereth, there are 
			nonetheless a growing number of Undead - mostly the risen forms of 
			those who died before discovering the Lifestones. Some evil magic, 
			its source unknown, is touching the slain and raising them to wreak 
			vengeance upon the living. 
			<p>The notion of the Undead as slow and stupid is only partly true. 
			While the weaker forms cleave to this archetype, their more powerful 
			fellows are often as quick and intelligent as the living - and far 
			more malicious. </p>
			The Undead are commonly found in wastelands forsaken by the living, 
			such as barren deserts and fetid swamps, and also in old tombs, 
			ruins and dungeons. 
			<p>There are many different kinds of undead, including the 
			following: </p>
			<b>Skeletons </b>are bare bones, stripped of their flesh. They 
			attack with weapons, or with hands and feet. The most powerful 
			Skeleton Lords also wield magic. <i><b>Weak </b></i>(leaders: <i><b>
			Dangerous </b></i>to <i><b>Lethal</b></i>) 
			<p><b>Zombies </b>are walking corpses. They fight like Skeletons, 
			but are stronger and more apt to use sorcery. <i><b>Dangerous</b></i>
			</p>
			<b>Liches </b>and <b>Revenants </b>are the animated bodies of 
			wizards. They are among the most powerful magic-users of all the 
			undead. <i><b>Deadly </b></i>to <i><b>Lethal</b></i>
			<p><b>Mu-miyahs </b>resemble zombies, but their bodies have been 
			preserved, either by art or accident, and do not rot. All of them 
			can use magic. <i><b>Dangerous </b></i>to <i><b>Lethal</b></i> </p>
