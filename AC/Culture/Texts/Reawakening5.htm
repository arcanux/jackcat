    Posted on the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=147">Turbine</a> site during the
    <a href="../Dereth/Waking2.htm">Waking 
    From the Abyss</a> event (Dec. 22, 2003).<br>
    <br>
    She had nearly died. Wounds opened all over her body as the Isparians 
    assailed the Ancient Queen. It was if she and the queen shared the same body 
    and mind. Nuhmudira had nearly lost her fight. She recalled the feeling of 
    the pressure on her heart and the shade that fell over her eyes. 
    Blindness…followed by tightness in her chest, the seizing of her lungs, the 
    feeling of piss running down her legs…Death. It hadn’t left her, even now.<br>
    <br>
    Every time she closed her eyes the carrion wail of the afterlife called to 
    her. Something went horrifically wrong and nearly damned her. She had 
    dismissed her apprentices, began to draft a charm that would drive the 
    memories away, and found nearly a month missing from her life. But the month 
    that had slipped through her fingers was the month she had studied the book, 
    the time she had studied to remedy the ill feelings and tastes of hollow 
    succor. She was still aware of the flavor of blood and the pungent smells 
    that accompany one’s demise.<br>
    <br>
    She had waited a week before returning to the book. During that time she 
    found herself crying or staring into the darkness with fear coating her 
    heart. She found that light stung her eyes, she was cold, and even hot 
    chocolate failed to warm her bones. Her appetite waned, and she became 
    consumed with thoughts of dying.<br>
    <br>
    She tried writing, but her tears stained the pages and smudged the ink. She 
    tried singing but the chorus that joined her voice was dissident and 
    fractured. She tried speaking but a shrill voice not her own strained across 
    her vocal chords and pierced the air around her. Nothing helped. The books 
    held the answers.<br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira drew a blanket over her shoulders and lit a single candle. The 
    flame flickered and cast menacing shadows over her room. The wind caused the 
    flame to wildly dance from side to side. She opened the book and failed to 
    recognize the figure clad in white, sitting serenely across the room in a 
    chair two sizes too small for him.<br>
    <br>
    He watched as she read. A long, withered index finger slid along the ancient 
    pages of the living tome. She lived still--remarkable. Others who had 
    attempted what she had were reduced to incoherent states, babbling on or 
    chittering in voices akin to the Olthoi. The madness deterred the wise 
    members of Kellin’s council, but there were many who were arrogant enough to 
    believe they could sedate the Queen and reclaim the glory of the Cerulean 
    Throne. Of course, he had not attempted such mania. He researched, studied 
    and devised a way to trap one of her children, not fully grown or developed. 
    The plan had worked well, but the link between the Olthoi was greater than 
    he could have imagined. Their captive was consumed from within its own mind. 
    The experiment was a failure.<br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira was consumed now, he could see it in the tentative way she 
    approached the pages. Her hands trembled as she struggled to write notes 
    onto a parchment she kept beside the book. She refused to mutter the words 
    she was translating, and the room was silent. The sound of her breathing was 
    nearly imperceptible. He drew his hand through his long beard and cleared 
    his throat.<br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira leapt from her seat and instinctively called to the arcane forces 
    about her. A cacophony of sound assaulted her ears as millions of voices, 
    none her own, forced the words from her throat, but they were well formed 
    and a wave of orange light spread from her hand, grew into a spear of 
    crackling dark red energy, and launched itself at the old mage. <br>
    <br>
    Asheron stared in amazement as she called higher magic into being. He 
    reacted quickly and placed a shield of his own arcane knowledge to contain 
    the energy she levied. Her intonation had been perfect but her eyes belied 
    the truth, she heard something different than he. She collapsed to a knee 
    and began to breathe heavily.<br>
    <br>
    “Yes Nuhmudira, you failed. I still live. What’s more I am aware that it was 
    you that meant to bring about my death. I am certain you conspired to 
    assassinate Elysa, but I am not one to pry into the minds of others, and you 
    suffer even greater fits than I would have brought upon you.” <br>
    <br>
    He stood and walked to her side. She looked up at him, tears streamed from 
    the corner of her eyes and her mouth hung agape. <br>
    <br>
    “Do not look to me for aid. You have called this madness upon yourself. You 
    traffic with knowledge that has been lost to this world. Not lost, buried 
    beneath the weight of eternity. You cannot fathom what you have unearthed 
    and what you have stirred.” Nuhmudira grasped at his robes and made a 
    pitiful sound.<br>
    <br>
    “You turn to me now.” He knelt to her side and placed a hand gently at the 
    bottom of her chin. Her eyes met his, “The difference between you and 
    Candeth Martine is that within Candeth, I saw qualities of a hero, qualities 
    of a being that could be redeemed. Within you Nuhmudira, I see only hatred, 
    malfeasance and megalomania. You remind me of an errant student that I did 
    not wish to teach.” As the words trailed off into silence he pulled his hand 
    away from her chin.<br>
    <br>
    Her sobbing ceased at once.<br>
    <br>
    “I came to tell you, witch.” His words were pointed. “I am leaving Dereth. 
    But my eyes will be cast upon you wherever you may go. Elysa may be trusting 
    of a viper in her house, but I would sooner cut its heart out then allow it 
    to spread its venom.” <br>
    <br>
    The room flooded with a violet light, and then the whistling of the wind 
    beneath the door returned. Nuhmudira began to laugh. At first she heard the 
    cacophony, millions of shrill voices, then they retreated to a chorus of 
    hundreds, and finally to just one, her own. Fear still plagued her mind, but 
    there was cognizance. Asheron was ever the fool.<br>
    <br>
    She returned to the book with new resolve. As the candle flame sputtered in 
    the rising well of wax, she began her casting.<br>
