    <td valign="top" width="441"><small><font face="Arial">We'd left the front door open after
    coming in, but the cabin was still very dark. I kicked piled furniture away from the rear
    door, and opened it. Wan red sunlight spilled across the threshold and painted the
    cluttered gloom the color of desert stone. Behind me, Kei, my fellow apprentice, repeated
    in her most soothing voice, &#147;Jarilyn, where's your daughter? Ma'am? What happened to
    Cortrima?&#148; over the hysterical wails of the Aluvian woman we'd found here. </font></small><p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Cortrima,&#148; Jarilyn sobbed. &#147;They came and took her. They took
    her in the night. Their hands came through the walls! I couldn't stop them.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I doubted we'd get much information from her. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>&#147;Here comes another one.&#148; At the front door, Master
    Celdiseth stood with arms folded across his barrel torso, staring coolly up at the
    monstrous Spire that howled but a few furlongs away. I hopped back across the room to
    look, and a jumble of furniture toppled as I went. The woman resumed flinching and
    shivering. Kei shot me a poisoned look and grabbed her trembling hands again.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Sure enough, the heart-like organ at the center of the Spire
    had begun to pulse brighter once more. Celdiseth sat, carefully arranging the folds of his
    dark red robe around him. I stood. I knew what was coming would hurt, but I was determined
    to stay on my feet. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The organ gave a final, tremendous pulse, squeezing out from
    between the black claws that held it. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The ground recoiled. Leaves spun away from the quivering
    trees. Shreth howls floated over the hill. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">A thousand invisible razors entered my head from all sides
    and crawled and dragged themselves slowly down my spine. Light fell away into a long
    tunnel, with the red heart of the Spire flickering at the end. Around the edge of my
    vision, black shapes swam and twisted like columns of smoke. The Spire's howl washed out,
    and behind it I seemed to hear the distant squealing of something noisome and unnatural. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Then I heard a harsh, unwilling cry of pain, choked out by
    unendurable agony. The voice was my own. From back in the cabin, Kei released an
    unembarrassed shriek. From the ground to my right Celdiseth released a mere grunt. My legs
    disappeared from under me, and I was rolling on the dying grass, clutching at the ethereal
    blades that lacerated the space inside my skull. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">With a final shudder, the ground fell still. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I panted, spitting clover blossoms and dust, and rolled onto
    my back. Discolored clouds squirmed across the yellow sky, like beads of oil across a
    puddle. Celdiseth sat quietly beside me. His face was still, though white and drawn. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>&#147;We should leave soon,&#148; he said, quietly. &#147;Check
    on Kei. We'll take Jarilyn with us.&#148; <font color="#6B6B6B">EpiK Sucks</font></small> </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The woman, lacking any sensitivity to magic and therefore
    unaffected by the quake, carried on as if nothing happened. &#147;I couldn't do anything,&#148;
    she sobbed. &#147;They took her and I couldn't stop them. Blessed Mothers forgive me, I
    couldn't keep my baby safe . . .&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">* * * </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">We traveled many leagues, and as we went, the pains
    associated with the quakes became less intense. By nightfall, we were deep under the green
    shelter of Tiofor Wood. Celdiseth and I gathered up the logs we'd chopped for a large
    fire. &#147;I doubt it will keep the Shadows at bay,&#148; he grunted, &#147;but at least
    we'll be able to see them when they come.&#148; Kei, meanwhile, sat huddled with the
    Aluvian woman, stroking her fine, cornsilk hair and murmuring reassuring nothings to her.
    I'd wrapped Jarilyn up in a heavy woolen blanket. My mother had given it to me when I
    began my apprenticeship with Celdiseth in the far north. The paleness of her hair against
    the dark material was striking. It made her seem still more thin and frail. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Her story had come out in pieces, spaced by fits of helpless
    tears. Varel, the enchanter we had come in search of, had been married to her for a number
    of years. The pains of the Spire had apparently driven him mad, and he ran away into the
    woods. The loss of their child had driven Jarilyn to madness as well, though she was too
    defeated by the knowledge to run anywhere. Celdiseth and I had taken turns carrying her
    across the wilderness. My arms were quite sore, though he seemed unaffected. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">After a time, Jarilyn fell into a restless sleep. I sat
    beside her to eat my mushroom stew. I listened to her breathe, and to the crickets that
    serenaded the pale rising moons. She made a small noise in her sleep, began to turn and
    twitch. Her breathing became fast and shallow, and her eyes and hands squeezed tight, as
    if dreams were showing her things she would rather not see. I reached for her, to brush
    the hair away from her eyes, smooth the wrinkles of worry and pain that creased her
    forehead -- but hesitated. I looked towards Kei and Celdiseth, feeling foolish and
    embarrassed, and my hand darted away. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Celdiseth had boiled water for green tea, a passion he had
    absorbed from the scholars of Hebian-to. He sat with his hands wrapped around a
    hand-carved pine stoup, a gift from a powerful Sho enchanter he knew, and watched the
    cracking shadows cast by the fire. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Master?&#148; Kei asked quietly, trying not to wake
    Jarilyn. She knelt on a reed mat near the fire, her hair unbound for the night, and
    hanging to her waist. A single ivory comb held the sable cascade away from her eyes and
    the flames. She pushed the loose sleeves of her robe back, so she could warm her hands.
    &#147;Is magic different here? Compared to Ispar, I mean.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The magic of Dereth is different in many ways,&#148;
    Celdiseth said. &#147;The most fundamental way may be the most important.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;What do you mean?&#148; I asked. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;On Ispar, mana suffused all the land and sea, in an
    unseen cloud. When a mage drew upon it, there might be a gentle breeze as other mana moved
    to fill the void he had made. It was hard to touch, though. One needed talent and skill to
    manipulate the mana of Ispar, and mages rarely managed to ascend above the third circle of
    their spells. One who managed to reach the sixth circle was almost unheard of. Here,
    though . . . Tell me, young Evaen, have you ever heard a mariner speak of ocean-currents?&#148;
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;No, Master,&#148; I said. &#147;I'm from the highlands.
    The Luparvium Mountains. That's about as far from the sea as you can get, and --&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;And no shipwrights or sailors have come across from
    Ispar,&#148; Celdiseth finished for me. &#147;Yes. Quite so. At times, I have wondered if
    that might be by design.&#148; He sipped from his stoup thoughtfully, and continued.
    &#147;The oceans are not simply large, stagnant puddles. Rivers, called currents, run
    through them. They are powerful and invisible. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;It is similar with the mana of Dereth. There is no
    cloud of mana here, no gentle breezes. Magic flows through the land in raw torrents.
    Rather like the Canfeld River in spring, I'd say, when the snows of your mountains melt.
    Some of that power may leak or spill, yes, and we use that to work our little magics.
    There is little enough of this spillage, though -- that is why our spells weaken as more
    learn the arts -- and that is easy to touch. Almost anyone can cast here. The mass of this
    world's mana seems to run unseen and untapped through the land -- far more power than any
    mage could hope to control. It is somehow locked up, though, and we cannot touch it. I
    suspect even attempting to do so would be fatal.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Why is that important?&#148; Kei asked. &#147;Whether
    magic floats like a pollen on the wind or rushes like a mighty river, we seem to able to
    influence it well enough. If there is more power here than a mage could control, enough to
    kill even, is it not for the good that we cannot touch it?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Celdiseth's vein-blue eyes stared at her intently from across
    the fire. &#147;Because, Kei -- these are not earthquakes that have been rocking the land.
    Each time one occurs, these mana-currents shift. The 'rivers' are being dragged out of
    their courses, towards the Spires. That is why they cause some of us pain; the mana we
    command is literally being ripped from our bodies. What we are experiencing are . . .&#148;
    one corner of his mouth twisted downwards at the inelegance of the word, &#147;<i>manaquakes</i>.&#148;
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Why are they happening?&#148; I said. &#147;Is that
    what the Spires are for?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;I believe that is their purpose,&#148; Celdiseth said.
    &#147;As for why, I don't know. I have been trying to find out since they first erupted.
    Whatever the Shadows do has a reason, whether we understand it or not. They are a wily
    foe, or so the records of the last Shadow war tell us. If we do not understand their aims
    . . . we cannot defeat them.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;But we have defeated them,&#148; I said. &#147;We
    fought at Stonehold, Kei and I, and . . .&#148; Celdiseth shot me such a fierce look of
    disapproval that I stammered and fell silent. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;We were through with our studies for the day, Master,&#148;
    Kei said reasonably. &#147;We couldn't let others fight where we would not. Are we not
    being trained to serve the good of all?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;You're twisting my words,&#148; Celdiseth said darkly.
    &#147;You are being trained so that you might, someday, be capable of serving the good of
    all. Until then, you risk yourself and those who think to depend upon you . . . Why do you
    suppose I make my apprentice robes the color I do?&#148; he asked, suddenly. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Kei pursed her lips. &#147;I had thought, Master, that it was
    in honor of the Elder Spirits. Orange is the color of breath from the Dragon of Power,
    from whom we might learn the discipline needed to control great magics. It is also the
    color of the Firebird of Splendor's wings, who teaches us to disregard the pleasures of
    the world and focus on our studies. Finally, it is the color of the sparks struck by the
    hooves of the Unicorn of Grace, who reminds us that we must help all, even should it cost
    us our lives.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Celdiseth chuckled. &#147;A pretty lie. Heard that from
    Shoyanen Kenchu, did you?&#148; Kei looked stricken, and Celdiseth's expression softened.
    &#147;Well, perhaps she was sincere. She likes that sort of symbolism. That's not my
    reason, though. I make them such a bright color because, until you have learned to control
    your abilities, you are more a danger to yourself and your comrades than whatever you
    fight.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I felt my jaw hang. &#147;You mean,&#148; I said slowly,
    &#147;that we wear this bright orange . . .&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;So that experienced mages will be able to spot you in
    the confusion of combat. So they can be prepared to avoid your misfires and fizzles, and
    watch to ensure you don't get in over your head.&#148; He took another sip from his stoup
    as I sat back heavily, and Kei squirmed in embarrassment. &#147;It's nothing to be ashamed
    of,&#148; Celdiseth added. &#147;I wore the orange robe of an apprentice for many years
    myself, back in Feirgard. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;All beside the point, of course.&#148; He sighed
    impatiently, and his silvered brows furrowed. He peered into his stoup. &#147;And my point
    is simply this: the attacks the Shadows have made cannot be their true goal. If they were,
    they would send greater numbers. Empyrean lore tells us that they have infinite legions,
    and that they slew all the heroes and heroines who tried to stand before them. If they
    were invading, why would they send only a few hundred at a time, and fall back so readily?
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;No, their true goal is something else . . . and I will
    wager you an Olde Ispar Stout that it involves the Spires, and what is happening beneath
    us. The attacks are merely to keep us distracted, to allow their generals to assess our
    strength, while they achieve whatever their true goal may be. They are ancient, and we are
    something new in the world. Are we a force to be reckoned with, toyed with, or ignored? We
    do not yet have a place assigned to us in their plan.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The release of Bael'Zharon,&#148; I said, and the words
    fell cold and heavy on the ground. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Celdiseth grunted. &#147;The Hopeslayer. Probably, yes . . .
    Though I cannot imagine what the Spires or the old standing stones have to do with it.
    Frore was far from either, and the thesis that the Great Work was a piece of his crystal
    prison has been accepted by almost all of the wise. Regardless, the Shadows are achieving
    their goal someplace hidden, as we -- as you -- run hither and yon, fighting their
    captains and generals.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">His keen eyes sought mine across the campfire. With a
    decisive snap, a spark was sent up towards the bloated moons. &#147;Do you see why I want
    you to keep clear of the fighting, Evaen? You are not yet ready to fight legends . . . and
    until we understand the nature of the enemy, I believe we must hold a reserve.&#148; </font></small></p>
