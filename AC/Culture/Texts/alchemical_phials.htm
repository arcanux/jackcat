	<font size="2" face="arial">Welcome, my friend, to an exciting new world of 
	Alchemy! Contained within these pages are the processes and interactions 
	necessary for the creation of throwable phials that will aid you greatly in 
	combating the dangers of this world! Read on, my friend, and learn those 
	secrets of Alchemy that I wish to now share with you.<br>
	<br>
	- Janier al-Evv<br>
	<br>
	Overview:<br>
	<br>
	Using many previously existing oils, along with a couple newly created oils 
	and a set of specially crafted Phials (Available exclusively from Janier al-Evv), 
	a number of combat effective and throwable phials may be created. These 
	formulas will be detailed in the following pages. At this point in the 
	development of these phials, several effects similar to the Vulnerability 
	Spells used in Life Magic may be duplicated.<br>
	<br>
	The Oils:<br>
	<br>
	The Oils used in this process are mostly obtained from the oils used in the 
	crafting of elemental or enchanted arrows. With some additional research, I 
	have created 3 more oils, using the same process, to make oils that weaken 
	the targets physical resistances. What follows is a list of the effects and 
	the related oils, when used with an Enchanted Phial:<br>
	<br>
	Table 1.1, Existing Oils and their Effects:<br>
	Bloodseeker Oil = Imperil Phials<br>
	Acid Oil = Acid Vulnerability Phials<br>
	Lightning Oil = Lightning Vulnerability Phials<br>
	Fire Oil = Fire Vulnerability Phials<br>
	Frost Oil = Cold Vulnerability Phials<br>
	<br>
	To this process, I have added three oils, crafted in the same manner as the 
	above existing oils, using the following process:<br>
	<br>
	Table 1.2, Crafting the New Oils:<br>
	1a) Use an Alembic on Verdigris to get a Slashing Infusion.<br>
	1b) Use an Aqua Incanta on a Slashing Infusion to get Slashing Oil<br>
	<br>
	2a) Use an Alembic on Cadmia to get a Bludgeoning Infusion.<br>
	2b) Use an Aqua Incanta on a Bludgeoning Infusion to get Bludgeoning Oil<br>
	<br>
	3a) Use an Alembic on Ginseng to get two Piercing Infusions.<br>
	- This is due to there being more essential material in the Ginseng Plant.<br>
	3b) Use an Aqua Incanta on a Piercing Infusion to get Piercing Oil<br>
	<br>
	These new oils are used with the Enchanted Phials to gain the following 
	effects:<br>
	<br>
	Table 1.3, New Oils and their Effects:<br>
	Slashing Oil = Blade (Slashing) Vulnerability Phials<br>
	Bludgeoning Oil = Bludgeoning Vulnerability Phials<br>
	Piercing Oil = Piercing Vulnerability Phials<br>
	<br>
	The Phials:<br>
	<br>
	The Phials are made from the same materials used in the crafting of Spell 
	Scarabs, and have a similar effect on the resulting power and delicacy of 
	the Phial. Now, interestingly enough, due to the unique alchemical nature of 
	Lead, Enchanted Lead Phials could not be created. Because of this, there are 
	no base versions of the final Phials, utilizing effects similar to the 
	lowest tier of Life Magics. Similarly, something in the nature of the magics 
	of the 7th tier also have, at present, proven to be impossible to replicate. 
	I believe the power of the magics themselves may be too complex to be 
	contained through the alchemical methods I employ to make the Phials.<br>
	<br>
	I did, however, manage to create Platinum Phials and an empowered version of 
	the Platinum Phials, whose inherent Alchemical Magics will overpower the 
	innate magical resistances of those tougher creatures in Dereth. This is not 
	a guaranteed effect, but it will be far harder for the creature to resist 
	the effects of an Empowered Platinum Phial than those effects from a 
	non-empowered Platinum Phial, and harder for a creature to resist a 
	non-empowered Platinum Phial than a Pyreal Phial.<br>
	<br>
	The following table lists the Phial and the effective power of the 
	Alchemical Magics it is capable of, for those who are not yet familiar with 
	how the Spell Scarabs work.<br>
	<br>
	Table 2.0, Phials and their Effective Power:<br>
	Enchanted Iron Phial = Level 2 Magics<br>
	Enchanted Copper Phial = Level 3 Magics<br>
	Enchanted Silver Phial = Level 4 Magics<br>
	Enchanted Gold Phial = Level 5 Magics<br>
	Enchanted Pyreal Phial = Level 6 Magics<br>
	Enchanted Platinum Phial = Level 6 Magics, but harder to resist.<br>
	Empowered Platinum Phial = Level 6 Magics, but much harder to resist.<br>
	<br>
	To craft a throw-able Phial, you must simply use an Enchanted Phial upon the 
	proper type of Oil you wish the effect of. The Oil sets the effect, and the 
	Phial sets the power of the effect.<br>
	<br>
	An important note about this process: The Phials get more delicate the more 
	powerful they are, and also are more difficult to use. It takes a skilled 
	hand in Alchemy to both create the final, throw-able phials, and to use them 
	in the field. Remember this, as it is very important. If you are not an 
	Alchemist, you will not be able to use these Phials. On the other hand, if 
	you can craft the Phial, chances are you can use it. There is some 
	discrepancy in this, as to wield the phial, you will need the skill to 
	create the phial without a mage artificially enhancing your skill at 
	Alchemy. Be warned.<br>
	<br>
	To aid those Alchemists who have not practiced the art of throwing things, I 
	have crafted a spell into each of the Phials which will aid you in this. 
	Forgive me, Ciandra has crafted the spell for me, and I have added it to the 
	Phials. My knowledge of magics outside of Alchemy is limited, and I do not 
	wish to take credit for the work of another. Her assistance is greatly 
	appreciated in this endeavor. <br>
	<br>
	With this enchantment, the Phial's accuracy is unmatched, but not absolute. 
	A trained skill with thrown weapons never hurts, especially when throwing 
	phials at a creature will most likely anger it.<br>
	<br>
	Also, be warned that all of the Phials are fragile, and you will need to 
	protect it from breakage should you be attacked while holding one. Dodging 
	about in melee will be notably harder while wielding a Phial in combat.<br>
	<br>
	Good luck and good hunting! Show everyone that there is an undeniable 
	strength in he oft-ignored magical art of Alchemy!</font></p>
