	<span lang="en-us">With the help of some splendid warriors, we have managed 
	to break through the Viamontian lines. Now, we take the fight to Teth! I am 
	certain that this will be a quick campaign. In fact, it reminds me of a 
	story...but perhaps I shall work on my memoirs later. For now, we shall make 
	camp and scout the area.<br>
	<br>
	The scouts have returned with bad news. We have been pursued over the neck 
	by a Viamontian army. I am going to move to the northern coast area - that 
	way, if the Fort Tethana warriors are in service to the Viamontians at this 
	point, we won't be outflanked. And the other brigadiers say I've no sense of 
	strategy!<br>
	<br>
	More bad news from the scouts. The Viamontians continue to pursue, and in 
	addition, some Tumeroks have been sighted - the fully bipedal unfriendly 
	sorts, not the Aun. I suspect they are Renegades, given where we are. At 
	least Fort Tethana has not mustered any forces onto the field yet.<br>
	<br>
	We have arrived at what I deem to be a proper battlefield. The Viamontians 
	are light on ranged attackers, so the hills of the area will help us 
	concentrate our missiles and magic upon the enemy. Plus, it will allow us to 
	watch for any Tumeroks approaching from unexpected angles.<br>
	<br>
	The Viamontians have arrived to the field, but have not launched an attack 
	yet. Instead, they have sent a runner indicating that their general, Count 
	Di Orza, wishes to parlay on the morrow. I shall, of course, oblige - as 
	dirty a business as war can be, there is no reason not to extend a certain 
	amount of courtesy to others of noble rank.<br>
	<br>
	We are undone. Not just my army, but all who wished to take the field of 
	battle today.<br>
	<br>
	The first surprise of the morning was that there were three sides 
	represented at the morning parlay. Count Di Orza was also surprised to find 
	that a contingent of Renegade Tumeroks had invited themselves to this 
	parlay, at which they railed against pretty much anyone who had ever wronged 
	them, including Varicci, of course. They expressed their desire to destroy 
	both armies as soon as hostilities commenced, though I never saw evidence 
	that their forces were large enough to do such a thing.<br>
	<br>
	Count Di Orza himself was, much as I hate to say it, a pleasant enough sort 
	who was similarly distressed at such a barbaric presence as the Tumeroks. 
	His purpose at the parlay, he managed to say between Tumerok rants, was to 
	offer my forces a chance for a civilized surrender. He was not like most 
	Viamontians I have met, but polite and approachable - even to me, 
	representative of his nation's sworn enemy!<br>
	<br>
	It was midway through one of the Tumerok rants that one of my men noticed 
	that the skies had grown very dark. Since there had not been a cloud in the 
	sky before that, he found it very unusual and worth noting. All of us, even 
	the Tumeroks, stepped out of the tent to view what my man had seen.<br>
	<br>
	What we saw struck us all speechless. Though it was morning, the skies were 
	as dark as midnight, but with no moon or stars. A cold wind blew against my 
	cheek, and I heard only an eerie silence.<br>
	<br>
	Then, suddenly, we were all knocked over by a tremendous impact. I cannot 
	describe what happened, because I was stunned from the blast. When I 
	regained my senses, I perceived a most amazing thing. The hills of my chosen 
	battlefield were gone, replaced with an ash gray crater. Many of the 
	Viamontians and New Aluvian soldiers were slain instantly by the impact. 
	Others were alive, but as I watched they began to change into dark, 
	insubstantial forms - shadows. Still others were no longer there at all, 
	with only dropped weapons or standards to prove their existence at all.<br>
	<br>
	Count Di Orza drew his weapon, and I did likewise, possibly the only two 
	Isparians left on the field able to do so. At once, he swore that until we 
	had ascertained what had happenedto our forces, he would hold a truce. I 
	agreed, and we began to search among the ruins of the camps.</span></font><p>
	<span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="arial">We found a portal in the middle of the new 
	crater, heavily guarded by shadows. Some of them were men and women with 
	whom I had dinner the previous evening. Others were ther brutish forms of 
	Viamontian Knights, tained with darkness. All were now hostile to both 
	myself and Count Di Orza, and we slew several before being forced to fall 
	back.<br>
	<br>
	We are now in a grove of trees at the edge fo the crater, but I can already 
	sense a darkness closing in. Count Di Orza says he will not succumb lightly, 
	and I am of the same mind. Let whosoever finds this journal bring it to 
	someone...anyone. The Viamontians and New Aluvians will want to know what 
	has happened to their forces, and I imagine even those from Fort Tethana 
	will want to know. Just make sure that someone knows of the doom that came 
	to this battlefield. I do not expect to survive to do so.<br>
	<br>
	It comes. Farewell.</font></span><font size="2" face="Arial"><span lang="en-us"><br>
