      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dereth's seasons are beautiful, whether it
      be deep winter, when the snows blanket the countryside, or in plush
      spring, when the trees are blossoming and the grass is a deep verdant
      green. However, it seems that while the seasons change, the fauna does
      not. At least not until now.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Recently, during my scouting of Dereth, I
      noticed some of the newly arrived fauna finally adapting to the Derethian
      seasons. This has lead to me publishing this book, in the hopes that it
      will help other fellow poac...Err, hunters like myself.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Shreths: Shreths have been on Dereth for a
      long time, and are only now beginning to exhibit some signs of finally
      adapting to the shifting seasons. Recently, their hides have begun to
      thicken, resulting in a the occasional shreth hide, which is useful in
      making armor for your hands and feet. If a large enough hide could be
      found, it is possible you could even make pants out of it. Bring whatever
      you find to your local leather crafter. I'm certain he can do something
      with it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wisps: It is debatable whether or not these
      creatures are even alive, yet I have noticed that on occasion when they
      die, they leave behind a crystallized prism of some type. The sages I have
      shown it to say that it could be a result of the cold, but one way or
      another I know a useful item when I see it. As of yet, I've been the only
      person able to do anything with these Wisp hearts, but trust me when I
      tell you that they are certainly worth it, especially to those Asheron
      imitators. If you find one, bring it to me up in the Bandit Castle, and
      I'll help you out.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ursuins: These buggers are quick. They've
      been here for about three months, and they're already adapting! Maybe they
      can teach those mattekars a thing or two, and lead by example. Their coats
      are getting thicker for the winter, and as a result you can now
      occasionally find a coat that is worthwhile to strip and bring to a
      leather crafter. You can make all sorts of armor out of the hides,
      eventually competing with the Mattekar coat for protection.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, that's all for now. I'll keep you
      updated if anything else changes amongst the flora and fauna of Dereth.</font></td>
