      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Verily, the Bael'Zharon was
      mad in his final years of freedom; obsessed with vengeance, and savoring
      the misery of his enemies like fine wine. Were I to choose a word that
      described his every movement and motion, it should be &quot;rage.&quot;
      This be not the motivation of the one I followed into darkness. He showed
      then a righteous anger, a desire to see our kind treated with justice -
      not this blind, cruel hatred of all things Yalain. Even now, I feel his
      black thoughts, and they linger unpleasantly on his plans for them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think it be the
      inevitable result of too much time under the influence of the Thing. That
      from which we derive our powers twists. Atimes this is obvious; recall the
      use of the great flying beasts. Thou wert with me at the snaring of the
      one they called Aujanel. The sight of what the Black Breath did to it, and
      the shrieks of the prisoners as they were grafted to its bones, will never
      be dislodged from my recollection.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">More often, it seems to me,
      the corruption is subtle. Once we heard the Bael'Zharon speak with some
      misgiving of the power he had gained, wondering what its price would be.
      Perhaps we know. Now, it seems, his voice only whispers of wrath and pain,
      of conquering all and bringing them into the body. This sounds not like
      the Bael'Zharon I knew in times long past.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He has been twisted. Oh,
      not as thoroughly as the elder ones. Not yet. But while the Bael'Zharon
      rages and broods in his prison, the General remains cool and thoughtful.
      He still wonders what the price may be, and what would happen should the
      Nameless be released. Until we know this, we should not act as they would
      have it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So yes; I do agree that the
      General is better suited. But then, you knew I would, did you not?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You have my assurance that
      I will use all my power to prevent damage to that which my forces have
      recovered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A note, before I leave
      thee; I am become suspicious of the elder ones, those that existed before
      the Great War. They speak too little, and seem to much of a mind for my
      taste. I wonder indeed what their goals are. Speak not to them of our
      plans.</font></td>
