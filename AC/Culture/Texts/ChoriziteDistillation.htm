    <br>
    I have put quite a lot of time and effort into chorizite research. I will 
    attempt to simplify my many months of hard work into this short note, as I 
    am sure you are just as interested in hearing about the final result as I am 
    interested in revealing it to you. I will try to be short with my words.<br>
    <br>
    I have discovered a way to distill high quality chorizite into a powerful 
    formula. The result of this new found power is the transformation of 
    chorizite from a magic-ignoring substance, to that of a magic-absorbing one! 
    But understand this well -- only one type of material, found only in one 
    item on Dereth, has the ability to withstand the strange reaction to this 
    potent form of chorizite. Melee warriors of all disciplines should be most 
    interested to know that this unique item is a long-forgotten crystalline 
    shield known as an Aegis.<br>
    <br>
    An apprentice of mine recovered the Aegis we have only a few days ago. He 
    had been exploring and happened upon an old armory, while running along the 
    southern landbridge towards the Direlands. The compound was in a state of 
    decay, overrun with fiendish undead. <br>
    <br>
    Fighting fiercely through the hallways and rooms, he found a large quantity 
    of these Aegis in what appeared to be a storage area. He recalled to Rithwic 
    with his life, and one Aegis to show for his efforts.<br>
    <br>
    I was surprised by the shield's composition -- a crystal I had never seen 
    before. It felt brittle, as though a single blow might shatter it to pieces. 
    Since it would not be useful as a protective device any longer, we had 
    nothing to lose by testing the chorizite formula on it.<br>
    <br>
    As fate would have it, the chorizite fused with the crystal in a way I would 
    have never expected! The Aegis seemed lighter, almost transparent in a way. 
    It was as if the crystal did not physically exist anymore. But it was still 
    there, I could see and touch it, and it still retained some weight. <br>
    <br>
    When my apprentice wielded the shield, an aura not unlike that of a hollow 
    device sprung forth from the Aegis, surrounding him with a magical glow.<br>
    <br>
    Our initial results indicate that the aura generated by the Aegis is a 
    protective one, and will partially absorb the energy from a magical bolt. I 
    use the word partially, because we have not yet been able to extensively 
    test the properties of magic absorbtion.<br>
