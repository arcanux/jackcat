      )<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      <i>Late.</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One second beyond the time they had
      arranged for the exchange, it began sending. The Collective sang behind
      its mask as he relayed the incompetence of their servitors.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Inconsistency, absence, gray meat no
      better than purple.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Within the second's time, the Collective
      became aware of their servitors' failure and issued orders to the
      fracture.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Understood.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It freed its death mask from its cloaks for
      a moment and cleaned it. Mimicry leads to acceptance. In the distance,
      three shapes coalesced within the driving snow. They would arrive at the
      designated meeting place within the next twenty seconds.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Late.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Behind him, puppets waited in its
      presence--their master--flanked by the newest members of their forces.
      Were it not for the importance of the materials the gray beings provided,
      they would have been eliminated. Flesh could be used to collect what
      energy could not grasp.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the twenty seconds had passed, three
      Lugians stood before him. They pulled a makeshift device for carrying
      objects.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Primitive.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Late. </i>It spoke into their minds.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We are here, and this is the hour that
      we agreed upon.” The largest spoke in its language, a deep resonation
      that reverberated against its mask. Its essence crumbled apart and
      reformed into coherence.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Silence. Delivery. </i>Cascading energy
      in an unseen field filtered the thoughts into formative words that the
      lesser being would understand in its fleshy mind. Transfer was
      instantaneous and invisible to the lesser being.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Lugian motioned to the others and they
      dragged the heavy sled, weighted with a purple ore, closer to the Virindi.
      A bee-buzz hum filled the air as its puppets moved closer. Flickers of
      lavender licked from behind their masks and surrounded the makeshift
      sleigh.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A sound like a swarm of locusts clearing
      away a field churned and split the storm. The sleigh rose from the snow as
      energy leapt into the ground, melting away a perfect half-sphere. Flanking
      the sleigh, the puppets floated away from the Lugians, the sleigh
      following under their command.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You have the ore, where is our
      payment?”</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Payment.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Silent commands, carried by the space
      between, touched the Virindi's other companions. They jangled to life in a
      mockery of motion, arms swaying in opposition to the momentum of their
      feet. Heads sealed in a swathing of leather flesh hid an etched cylinder
      of chorizite framework. Fiber cloth covered the chorizite skeleton to
      rounded hamhock hands; glittering bands of anti-magic locked in an
      incandescent azure and pink swirl. A pair of rickety mock scarecrows
      trundled toward the Lugians.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Payment, made. Learn. Teach. Fear.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Streaks of azure and pink hung in the air
      as the Hollow Minions rained blows into the Lugian's body. Dumfounded, his
      companions stumbled away from the onslaught. A voice thundered in their
      minds as shimmering hands passed through armor, bones and flesh in ghostly
      images. No blood flowed from their wounds, but their leader winced in pain
      as life fled from his body.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Deliver. Learn. Time. . . Death.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The mannequins twisted their chorizite
      heads over the living specimens and examined them with hollow eyes.
      Swallowing their fear, the Lugians rose and turned back into the thick
      sheets of the snow, hoping that their fallen brother would greet them in
      their camp. The Virindi floated away from the lifeless form, flanked by
      his Hollow Minions.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Termination. Life force removed.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">***</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Liquid flooded into the shell. Strings
      fastened from the Singularity, pulled by the masters beyond, slid through
      the liquefied energy to establish a harness for their control. Chorizite
      hands fitted into place by servitors unaffected by the nature of the ore
      spun to life. The minion sat upright, a sheer crystalline shell.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Incomplete.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The observer looked over the model once
      more. A rotting orange husk of flesh, long turned rancid, sat upon a
      wooden pole. Straw poked through a moth-eaten blue smock. Trousers filled
      with leaves and wooden slats ended in an old pair of leather boots.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Previous control over these constructs had
      resulted in surprise in the meatlings, but they were built fragile and
      offered limited control from the Singularity. Gray fleshlings had been
      offered gifts in the form of distillation and processing, in exchange for
      continued delivery and collection. Inspiration had come from the meatlings
      who had created these stick constructs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Drudges pulled the clothing from the
      scarecrow and fitted it onto the crystalline figure. Flames engulfed the
      cloth and spread onto the Lurker. Mews of pain echoed in the stonework
      room rising above the hum of portal energy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Cease. </i>The Drudge imploded, leaving
      a neat red stain and perfect hide on the floor. Others scampered from
      shadows and collected the remains. They hurried the remnants to a large
      chamber and added the skin to a growing pile.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The crystalline stick-man sat perfectly
      still, no features visible save for the azure and pink swirling fists.
      Cloth had burned away on the shell. Compelled by its master a Lurker
      reached out and took hold of the spinning fist. No ill befell the Drudge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It moved behind the slab where the crystal
      scarecrow sat and was joined by two others. Portal energy swirled as they
      moved the slab toward an opening portal. Speckled white and purple dust
      fell from the place beyond the portal--then the rent closed. Once again
      the Lurker reached for the being. It mewed in protest, helpless to defy
      the command. Its hand pressed against crystal coated in chorizite, and no
      pain came.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Compose. </i>Gathering clothing from
      fallen comrades and piecing together fabrics from the hides of their
      brethren, the Drudges obliged. A poor replica of the construct of the
      meatlings came into being. Invisible strings etched the finishing touch by
      way of the pumpkin face on the thin cylinder of the Hollow Minion.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Puppeteered by unseen masters it rose and
      moved on ramshackle legs, swinging fists at unsuspecting and unmoving
      Lurkers. Fists passed through flesh and bone rending life to stasis. No
      blood flowed. No mess.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lurkers emerged from the shadows. They
      collected the corpses and added them to the growing pile in the other
      room.</font>
