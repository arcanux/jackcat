    Alb'arel ascendant, Rez'arel descendant Day 4 <br>
    <br>
    We are but four. Our food has held out for three days, and the wards upon 
    the door are holding. The conventional locks were more effective at first 
    but when the rumbling deep within the Lyceum ceased the wards seemed 
    reinforced. Now we are but four tired and starving initiates of the Perfect 
    Light. <br>
    <br>
    We shall not rest in our vigil for our purpose is to safeguard the helm of 
    the initiates as is charged by Lord Asheron. Let his journal serve as 
    memoriam of our efforts as we stand now against this crest of purple and 
    black that has so swiftly torn through our ranks. <br>
    <br>
    Alb'arel ascendant, Rez'arel descendant Day 5 <br>
    <br>
    These beasts are not sent from the Darkness, they are monstrosities that 
    serve the creature captured from the world where death loomed. Lord Asheron 
    protested the capture of the behemoth, he warned against its storage here, 
    and now we fear that she is free roaming the corridors of Knorr and shaping 
    it to her will. <br>
    <br>
    We have recounted the battle that brought us to this place where the Helm of 
    Initiates is kept and we all agree on the following. These creatures fight 
    with ferocity and cunning unmatched. The Dericost, who were formidable foes, 
    were not half as potent or efficient as these monstrosities. Though we are 
    all too young to have known the bite of the faceless ones that stormed the 
    surface of this world only to be repelled by the Lightbringer, we have 
    wagered that even they were not as fearsome. <br>
    <br>
    They are canny tacticians, placing smaller shock troops at the fore, these 
    smaller beast found holes in our ranks where saw none. The smallest with 
    large rear legs and a screech like the howl of undead in the swamps of Ireth 
    Lassel proved to nullify our magical aptitudes, shirking aside the gifts of 
    Illusion (Translator's Note: This is my most educated guess at the meaning 
    of the words Ignae Fatae) piercing the veil that covered the door to upper 
    and lower chambers of the barracks proper. Once within the largest marshaled 
    the field issuing orders through chirps and motions of their top most 
    pincers. The Golem guardians fell first as though the things had faced them 
    in the upper lairs. <br>
    <br>
    We watched as their most plentiful soldiered forward and cleared paths 
    through our men, shields buckled and the weapons of Lord Atlan did not bite 
    deeply against this menace. The potency of the pyreal does not work against 
    these invaders. The true slaughter began when those that walked on four legs 
    began scaling the walls and creeping along the ceilings falling on us from 
    above. Our ranks fell quickly then. <br>
    <br>
    Handfuls escaped deeper within the barracks but access to the conveyances to 
    the other portions of Knorr were sealed by a torrent of the chitinous 
    creatures. We four, Daelyn, Faerla, Haedu, and myself escaped within this 
    room and vowed to stand our ground; holding true to our oaths. <br>
    <br>
    Lord Asheron, should you still live and come into possession of this 
    journal, know that we four held the helm in safety for no less than four 
    days. <br>
    <br>
    Alb'arel ascendant, Rez'arel descendant Day 6 <br>
    <br>
    The chirping has returned, and with it the failing of our wards. The door 
    has yet to be breached but we four are preparing for what must come next. We 
    shall stand against the darkness to our last breath. <br>
