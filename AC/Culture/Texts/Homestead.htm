      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The dream collapsed into stale night sweat
      and twisted sheets.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asaina blinked. The tawny light of Alb'arel
      fell through the open window, coating the simple wooden furnishings of her
      room with warm, lustrous wax. The cool night air of the badlands wound
      itself through the room, rustling the scrolls and bringing in the gentle
      susurration of Zaikhal's fountain.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Softly, again, came a rap on her door.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She stood, gathering the blanket around
      herself, and shuffled across the book-strewn floor. “Yes, yes.
      Coming,” she grumbled, pushing sleep-wild hair away from her eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Sho girl in the hall, perhaps sixteen
      years old, gulped and bowed deeply, holding it until it seemed certain she
      would topple to the floor at Asaina's feet. Moonlight glittered off the
      polished obsidian chopsticks holding the sable hair off the back of her
      neck. “My sincere apologies for waking you at such an hour, Mistress al-Arqis.
      I have been sent by my master, Celdiseth. He wished me to give you a most
      urgent message.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asina folded her arms crossly, but forced a
      smile. “Worry not, child. I'm used to that old crank's ways.” The
      girl's eyes widened at the word. “What is your name?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hoshino Kei, mistress.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Have you walked far, Kei? I could make
      you some tea.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her mouth worked, but nothing came out.
      Then, “Portal magic, mistress.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ah. Well, tell me your message.”
      Asaina walked back across the floor and perched on the edge of her bed,
      folding her hands in her lap.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kei looked down and began to recite in low,
      even tones. “Master Celdiseth wishes to say that the Monster of the
      Labyrinth has just completed her studies, and called for a meeting of the
      Archmages and certain powerful nobles. Celdiseth desires that a
      representative of the Arcanum be present, for he expects what is said will
      be of great interest to all sages, and yet would not become common
      knowledge otherwise.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“He has chosen you because you are aware
      of the Monster's illicit appropriation of texts recovered by the Arcanum
      from the archives of Xarabydun. He also knows that you expressed
      disapproval of this, and were reprimanded by other members of the Arcanum
      as a result. He therefore believes that which will be whispered tonight
      must be heard by you. He yet recalls being impressed by your persistence
      in warning of the sudden frost that presaged the discovery of Old Frore.”
      The girl bowed again, and spoke in her normal voice. “This is the
      message I was given, Mistress.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asaina rose and walked to the window.
      Below, auroral waves of sand shimmered and drifted across the stones of
      the courtyard. So. This was the night the first age of humanity in Dereth
      would come to an end. The night nomadic wandering gave way to settlement,
      to true civilization.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The greatest schemer of Ispar was prepared
      to move, having at her side the lost secrets of Empyrean magic. “The
      Monster of the Labyrinth.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira, scholar of Tirethas.</font><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">-----</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The 
	door wearily creaked open at her touch, shushing the sound of excited 
	discussion into a stern, disapproving silence. Nine faces studied Asaina, 
	including-- </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“Queen Strathelar,” she curtseyed. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The tall blond woman brushed aside the 
	courtesy with a tired wave of her hand. “Walim al-Arqis. I see Master 
	Celdiseth's messenger found you.” </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Asaina could feel Kei stiffening into another 
	bow and stepping back. Poor child. She seemed very much a country girl out 
	of her depth. She turned to look back at her. “My thanks for guiding me 
	here, Apprentice.” </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kei murmured something appropriate and 
	continued to retreat, holding her bow and looking intently at the floor. 
	Behind her, a boy with straw blond hair skipped out of the path of her 
	posterior. His eyes were very blue, and very wide at the sight of the 
	elegant apprentice. That is the prince? Asaina smiled to herself. The very 
	image of his mother; lanky and pale, not at all like dark and muscular 
	Thorsten. Kei straightened and noticed him in the shadows along the wall.
	</font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“Erh, g'morning,” he said, blushing furiously.
	</font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Greetings, Prince Borelean,” Kei said, 
	formally. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“Dinna call me that,” he scowled. “Talk ta me 
	like a person.” Yes, definitely his mother's son. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Why are you here, Scholar al-Arqis?” The 
	voice crackled like old, dry sticks. Asaina turned back to the table. There, 
	in the candle-lit twilight at the end, lurked the old spider. “Have you no 
	scrolls to read, no shelves to dust, that you should meddle in the affairs 
	of those above your station at such an hour?” The hairs on the back of 
	Asaina's neck went rigid with indignation. A retort coiled in her mouth-
	</font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“I sent for her, Nuhmudira,” Celdiseth growled.
	</font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The other woman unfolded herself from her 
	chair. She was old as dust and stone, her hair spider web silver, her hands 
	gnarled as the mage's staff she leaned upon. “You are not welcome.” The 
	intensity of her black eyes nearly drove Asaina back a step. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“She is welcome,” Strathelar said simply, and 
	nothing more. The spider, ever a political beast, bowed to the queen, and 
	settled herself back in the cobwebs of her chair. The chair from which so 
	many plots had spun. The chair that had decreed no human settlements would 
	grow until they could be defended from the greatest enemy of all. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“As I was saying,” Nuhmudira said. “This art 
	I have learned from the texts of Xarabydun was used by the Seaborne Empire 
	to keep their homes safe from intrusion. It is therefore proof against their 
	own arts. With it, we may bind a parcel of land to an owner, who may bar 
	entry to any he or she wishes to keep out. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“At long last,” the spider breathed, “we have a 
	way to hold this land that is proof against the might of the Empyrean 
	themselves! We are free now to colonize this world, safe from the threat of 
	their return.” </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hogwash!” Celdiseth chortled. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“How would you propose we begin to distribute 
	this boon?” Jaleh al-Thani, bey of Ayan Baqur, loomed over the table, a 
	covetous emerald gleam in his eye. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Slowly, of course. Haste only leads to 
	error. That is the principle behind every decision I have made in my life. 
	One thing is certain, whether or not our homes are safe against Asheron's 
	people.” </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“They were never his people,” the queen said, 
	softly. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Whether or not they are safe against the 
	Empyrean,” Nuhmudira amended, “we will have to venture from them sometimes. 
	One day they will return from their diaspora. There will be a war then, 
	between the old residents of this island, and the new.” She looked around 
	the table, plainly daring anyone to disagree. The queen sucked on her lower 
	lip and said nothing, her eyes distant seas. “We must win, even against such 
	overwhelming power.” The old woman's eyes burned. “Dereth is our home now. 
	We have bled for it. All my efforts here have been towards solving this 
	problem.” </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“We will need material to pursue this war,” she 
	continued. “Spells. Weapons. Armor. There are many things in Dereth free for 
	the taking; leavings of the empires that once thrived on this land, and the 
	resources of the species that finally destroyed them. We shall call upon the 
	entire human population of Dereth to serve as our provisioner.” </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“The Keepers that bind the land shall 
	ultimately answer to the mages and nobles assembled at this table. We will 
	own the land. For one to tenant it, they must provide our chosen 
	representatives with whatever relics we require. We will post these people 
	in every town of Dereth. They will provide the special items that the 
	Keepers will recognize as payment. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“The war material the representatives collect 
	will be held in trust by the Arcanum,” she nodded at Asaina, “until that 
	day, may it be long in coming, that it is needed.” </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“And how shall we begin?” Jaleh asked, 
	looking somewhat disappointed. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“First, we should build a single settlement. It 
	has been some time since our carpenters plied their craft on such a scale. 
	They will need practice, and we will need to prove the concept. Some of the 
	arts involved are beyond the ability of Isparian craft. The Keeper, for 
	example. They rely on Empyrean demiurgy. We must make sure we can make them 
	function properly. It will take several months before we can rest assured 
	they operate as we desire. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“As time passes, we will continue to build. 
	Until we have sufficient numbers of houses constructed, I believe we should 
	refrain from selling any. There will be, I daresay, some demand for them. 
	Better to avoid riots. We must use our strength to fight the Empyrean, not 
	each other.” </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">“Oh come now,” Celdiseth said grumpily. “Surely 
	you don't believe this poppycock. This was a spell used by the Empyrean to 
	prevent burglary. Does anyone here seriously believe it will be any use 
	against the Hieromancers of the Seaborne Empire? The mana-bombards? The area 
	dispels? Do you think the Cathedral of Ithaenc would lie in ruins if it 
	was?” He turned to Asaina. “And you, fellow of the Zaikhal Arcanum? What do 
	you think of this?” </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the mornings, the smell of her mother's 
	kitchen garden had filled their house as the sun warmed the fragrant leaves. 
	She awoke every day to intoxicating air, rich with saffron and cinnamon, and 
	mint bought from far Aluvia. As the sun climbed the earth-colored walls, and 
	splashed the ember patterns of the tapestry she had hung on the wall 
	herself, she would pull the blanket tight around herself and imagine the 
	roots of home stretching deep into the earth. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">As she grew older, her mother taught her to weed 
	the garden, to fetch water from the well and shake it gently over the 
	plants. To pick the aphids off the leaves. When the choicest time to harvest 
	them was, and how to tie the leaves in a bundle to hang from the rafters to 
	dry. To carefully brush the dust and spiders from the garden demon, with its 
	bulbous eyes and ridiculous hat. “One day,” her mother told her, “this 
	garden will be yours to keep, and then your daughter's, and then hers.”
	</font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yuck!” she'd cried. “I don't want to tend 
	the garden forever, mother. I want to travel to distant lands, and learn 
	magic.” </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Asaina smiled, and blinked a few times. A quote 
	from the poet ibn Salayyar came to her. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">“It may be bitter fruit we pluck. Yet what 
	else is there to eat?” She faced Celdiseth's disapproving eye. “I would like 
	a kitchen garden, Master Celdiseth, whether the Empyrean return or not.”</font></td>
