    <br>
    The farms seem to be growing at a healthy pace. Myself and Remmick have been 
    spending more time keeping the vermin away then actually tilling the soil. 
    All manner of odd creatures can be found down here: rats, Olthoi,<span lang="en-us">
    </span>wasps, and perhaps the oddest, the grub.<br>
    <br>
    They remind me of the weevils that we used to find in crops back on Ispar. 
    Only these are far too large, growing as large as a man's leg sometimes.<br>
    <br>
    They've become more plentiful recently and Remmick thinks that there must be 
    something that is stirring them out of their dirt holes deeper in the soil 
    here. I just hit them a couple of times with my sword and they split apart. 
    They're too little to really provide much of a challenge.<br>
    <br>
    I rather prefer the Olthoi, pincers flying hither and fro, now that makes 
    for an interesting fight. Remmick is going top-side tomorrow to talk to 
    Hibdin about how well the crops are doing. He'll be gone for the rest of the 
    week.<br>
    <br>
    Solclaim 2nd Starday, 14 P.Y.<br>
    <br>
    One of the farmhands found a secret tunnel yesterday. We'd never seen it 
    before. I had them wait here while I grabbed a torch and headed down to see 
    what was there. I didn't find much of anything at all, though there were a 
    handful of those grub things munching away on dirt and some odd looking 
    crystals.<br>
    <br>
    I came back here and told the fellas to stay away from the hole until 
    Remmick gets back, he'll know more what to do. <br>
    <br>
    Of course, as I write this I am getting ready to go down there again. The 
    rest of the boys don't need to worry about it and I can handle myself.<br>
    <br>
    Solclaim 2nd Earthday, 14 P.Y<br>
    <br>
    I met a very nice man in the tunnel, his name was Brax and he was quite well 
    spoken. He said that he had been living under the ground for a long time. It 
    was funny when he talked, it almost seemed as though there was a hollow echo 
    coming from him, but I heard the echo in the tunnel before so it must have 
    been that.<br>
    <br>
    I am going back tonight now that the work for the day is done.</font><br>
