      <font face="Arial" size="2">Through diligence and study I, and my many 
      assistants, have been able to divine great magics that were heretofor 
      inaccessible. We have redoubled our efforts as of late and established 
      that we are reaching an understanding with the flow of mana here on Dereth. 
      With this greater understanding we have succeeding in many new endeavors.<br>
      <br>
      Housing, was the first of my major undertakings. The success in 
      establishing the barriers around our homes was not a simple task and took 
      me several years to complete. Then when complete I imparted that knowledge 
      to many that will maintain<br>
      the upkeep and placement of the covenant stones before our homes. This 
      world is ours, Isparians, and as such we should do our best to make it so.<br>
      <br>
      The second was a reawakening of sorts. Pulling greater strength from 
      within the heart of this land, calling the mana to flow in new directions 
      so that we have greater access to power. We are a resilient race, capable 
      of great undertakings, but we are still easily defeated by some foes. The 
      protection of our mystreious <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>benefactor, 
      Asheron, cannot last forever, and who are we to be beholden to a thing 
      such as he?<br>
      <br>
      I digress.<br>
      <br>
      With the success of the second undertaking I was able to craft elxirs from 
      various alchemical devices to enchant certain metals. However, the 
      strength of the metal would hold a charge for some time and then dwindle. 
      Save for Pyreal.<br>
      <br>
      But like all things that exist there are differing grades, and potency 
      even to the mystical metal pyreal. After more testing with these elixirs, 
      I commissioned the many alchemists and artificers within the Arcanum to 
      begin crafting both elixirs and gorgets from the metal.<br>
      <br>
      It became apparent quickly that the varying grades of metal allowed for 
      easier use of the imbued spells, but that the spells themselves were 
      weakened by the metal. The charge of the magic however did not fade.<br>
      <br>
      Once enough were created I set about the creation of a new spell. This is 
      no easy undertaking. But after time and study I was able to piece together 
      the spell and infuse the crafted neck pieces. The first few were 
      successful and have been given to the council members that assist the High 
      Queen.<br>
      <br>
      Since that time, other studies have consumed my efforts and I have taught 
      Hiro the secrets of the spell. He shall take on the resposibility
      <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>of infusing my gift to the Isparian 
      peoples.<br>
      <br>
      Nuhmudira </font></small></small></p>
      <p align="center"><span lang="en-us">
      -----------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Nuhmudira's Boon</b><br>
      <br>
      Nuhmudira struggled to create these objects. She has entrusted me to craft 
      them for any and all that will be given them. The process will be known by 
      myself and as I age, I will teach another that will take on the 
      resposibilty<span lang="en-us"> [sic]</span> when it is my time to pass.<br>
      <br>
      Until that time the secret is mine to keep.<br>
      <br>
      First, it should be known that the process is not a simple one. It taxes 
      the connection with the flow of mana in a way that cannot be explained in 
      simple words. So I shall say that I can create several over the course of 
      a cycle of the moons, but no more than that of each type for each person 
      that comes to me. I will need to rest after doing such.<br>
      <br>
      Second, these items are a gift. Something that all Isparians will have the 
      opportunity to create, provided that they show they are of the moral fiber 
      to entreat with such a gift.<br>
      <br>
      Third, these shall be created and used solely by those to whom they are 
      given.<br>
      <br>
      There are three grades of pyreal that have been used. For ease of 
      recognition we have made them into discernable colors: red, blue and 
      green.<br>
      <br>
      Each neckpiece will be infused with the power of Nuhmudira's spell. Each 
      will also hold a spell of the School of the Left Hand and one of the 
      School of the Heart. The power of each will depend on the grade of the 
      ore.<br>
      <br>
      Green: Third Circle Spells.<br>
      Blue: Fourth Circle Spells.<br>
      Red: Fifth Circle Spells.<br>
      <br>
      To create the object, I must be given the unimbued version of the 
      neckpiece. I will then infuse the piece with the power of Nuhmudira's 
      spell. After this it will be prepared for the addition of an elixir that 
      is the concentrated form of a School of the Left Hand.<br>
      <br>
      The item will then bestow an enhancement to the creaters
      <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>physical or mental endowment, as well as 
      fortifying them against the effects of harmful magics.<br>
      <br>
      After this form has been crafted an elixir with the concentrated form of a 
      spell from the School of the Heart can be added <br>
      <br>
      onto the neckpiece.<br>
      <br>
      This will complete the boon and allow the wearer/creater protection from 
      the attack form they chose to imbue the neckpiece with, as well as the 
      previous enhancements.<br>
      <br>
      Elixirs<br>
      <br>
      The alchemists have created fourteen elixirs through toil and tears to 
      enhance these items. Following is a list of these elixirs and their 
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      Elixir of Might - Enhances Strength<br>
      Elixir of Vigor - Enhance Endurance<br>
      Elixir of Nimbleness - Enhances Coordination<br>
      Elixir of Speed - Enhances Quickness<br>
      Elixir of the Single Mind - Enhances Focus<br>
      Elixir of Perseverance - Enhances Self<br>
      Elixir of Spring - Provides rotection <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>from 
      Acid<br>
      Elixir of Summer - Provides protection from Fire<br>
      Elixir of Autumn - Provides protection from Lightning<br>
      Elixir of Winter - Provides protection from Cold<br>
      Elixir of Misty Form - Provides protection from Bludgeoning devices and 
      spells.<br>
      Elixir of Plasmic Being - Provides protection from Piercing devices and 
      spells.<br>
      Elixir of Crystal Skin - Provides protection from Slashing devices and 
      spells.<br>
      Elixir of Preservation - Provides protection from all physical assaults.<br>
      <br>
      Our thanks, and mine go to Nuhmudira for what she has learned and imparted 
      to us all within the Arcanum.<br>
