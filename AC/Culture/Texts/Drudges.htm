	<img border="0" src="image_07.jpg" width="92" height="123" align="left">&#147;Young man, have you a pyreal for an old adventurer?&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Being of a nature inclined to ignore beggars, I moved to avoid
    the crumpled figure leaning against the wall. What cared I for these people, these haughty
    Sho who were so particular as to frown upon a mis-aligned teacup? </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;I could tell you a tale for that pyreal,&#148; he added,
    hurriedly. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">That stopped me, despite myself. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Yes indeed, a tale worthy of a young gentlemen like
    yourself,&#148; he said, in soothing tones. His face was almost completely hidden by a
    cloth shroud, the tradition among Sho who had taken ill. &#147;Aluvian, I see. Visiting
    from the northlands of Dereth?&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I indicated the negative. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Ah,&#148; the man said, shuffling away from the wall of the
    temple. A smell reminiscent of boiled cabbage and mildew wafted away from him in the wind,
    almost thick enough to be seen. &#147;You are a newcomer, then? Tell me -- did you come
    here directly, or were you, ah, misrouted?&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I did not understand the term, and shrugged, taking a step back
    to keep his filthy rags from brushing against my arm. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;There are those who are called to enter a portal, but find
    it does not take them directly to Dereth. Perhaps you are one of these?&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Again, I shook my head. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Mm. What kind of tale would you like, then? Perhaps
    something about those who were so . . . misrouted?&#148;</font><font color="#6B6B6B">UCKS</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I shook my head a third time. One new world was disorienting
    enough. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Something about the creatures who have fallen here from
    those worlds, then?&#148; he asked, sounding desperate. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I was in no mood for such casting about, and beckoned him to
    begin, seating myself cross-legged, in the Sho fashion. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">From between the ratty, stained folds of his sick-cloth and the
    crags of his own wrinkled skin, I caught a glimpse of large, mirthful dark eyes. &#147;A
    tale, then, of another ophan race.&#148; He fell from his hunched standing position into
    the shade of the temple wall. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Ah, this sun is harsh on old skin,&#148; he said,
    delicately arranging his bony bottom. &#147;It is very bright, and warmer than in the land
    of our ancestors, yes?&#148; I shrugged noncommittally, and he cackled. &#147;You are not
    one for wasting words, eh? Yes, yes, quite so. You pay me not for talking of the weather,
    eh? Very well. A tale then. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;In a world not entirely unlike this one, or unlike old
    Ispar, for that matter, there lived three races. Distant kin, they were, like the Aluvian,
    Sho, and Gharu'n. We do not know what they called themselves in that world. Among these
    races was one which, like my old eyes, found the light bright beyond bearing. They were
    nocturnal beasts, by necessity. Their kin were stronger and swifter, and smarter too. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">
	<img border="0" src="drudge1_small.jpg" width="108" height="200" align="right">&quot;So this race emerged only at night, when their betters did
    not prowl, and retreated to the places they did not frequent. They learned to live as
    shadowy scavengers, and rummaged among the battle-sites of their larger cousins once the
    sun, the Egg of the Great Firebird, returned to the bowels of the world. Their kin, the
    gangly Banderling and the rank Mosswart, would fight and kill each other over respective
    god-images. Or over a particularly fragrant fruit-bearing tree. Or a spring from which
    cool, clear water could be procured. Or simply because they both happened to find
    themselves in the same place. They were not particular about their violence. If you do not
    know this by now, you will soon. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;A sad tale this is, honorable traveler. These creatures,
    while not as enlightened as us, could have accomplished more by sharing than by fighting.
    It is fortunate that they continue to be at each other's throats here in Dereth, and that
    our peoples do not fight in such a manner. Were it not so? No, I will not speak of that. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;But, we were speaking of the third race, which hid in the
    shadows as their betters hooted and growled and died in a hundred little battles daily.
    This race we have named Drudge, for they appear capable of only the most menial of
    activities, or at least so far as we know. When the light faded, and the sky turned into a
    sea of blood -- taken as a sign, I am told, that the gods of the Banderling and Mosswart
    had approved the day's slaughter-sacrifice -- then the Drudges would mew and call, and
    trot out of their lairs, knuckles stirring up the dust behind them. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;By the hundreds and thousands, they would disperse across
    the land, seeking whatever abandoned and discarded food, weapons, and tools they could
    find. Base scavengers, they looted corpses, scuffling over trinkets and weapons. Their
    eyes hoarded and drank the spare light like the Gharu'n do water. I have heard tales that
    their sky is a miser's, with rare stars, and only a single misshapen moon to watch their
    nocturnal activity. Sometimes, when in numbers and their enemies few, they would attack
    the Banderling and Mosswart. Being weak and of cowardly demeanor, this was rare. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;When the Great Egg of the sun arose again, these wretched
    creatures would mewl in pain at its light, and flee. Blinking their great, sensitive eyes,
    they would scurry back into crowded caverns, dragging behind all the spoils they could
    grasp in their pale claws. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;While the Egg shone in all its majesty, awaiting that day
    -- blessed be it! -- when it hatches a new Firebird, they would sleep and caper. Down in
    the cool stone depths, they squabbled and bartered, in their simple-minded way, over the
    shiniest objects that had been recovered. They would reproduce, in scores. Being feeble
    creatures, they kept their numbers by having litters of a dozen at a time. They would make
    small fires -- perhaps their only civilized skill -- and crudely roast or boil what
    discarded food they had brought down from above, to feed their kittens. While Drudges can
    see quite well in the dark, they do require some light. They are not philosophers of
    magic, nor demons who can see in the complete absence of light. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;In this world, they live in much the same way. They infest
    those lodgings left untouched by stronger creatures, and take that which has been
    abandoned or lost by others. They live in colonies where possible, and underground by
    preference. Dereth's underground is riddled with dungeons -- natural caves, subterranean
    storehouses, sewers, even entire cities . . . and stranger constructs, whose purposes defy
    explanation. Nevertheless, Drudges can still be found living out in the open, for they
    are, as I have said, quite stupid, and easily forget the way home. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;Great numbers of these pathetic half-wits have been taken
    by the Tumerok, for use as slave labor in their own colonies. Many die at this work, but
    there are always more to take their place, and the Tumeroks do not love them. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&quot;I will tell you one thing more, before I ask for my coin.
    In Dereth have been seen Drudges altered by powerful magery, fierce and powerful in
    combat. You will know these by their color; rather than showing the sun-starved pallor of
    their kin, the hides of these Drudges range from an ashen gray to the black of obsidian. I
    have not yet found someone who can tell me who is changing them in this way, nor where,
    nor for what purpose. The answers are out there somewhere. I hope someone will share them
    with me, someday. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Now,&#148; the man said, lightly clapping his bony hands,
    &#147;I believe you owe me a coin, honorable sir.&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I did, and reached into my belt pouch as I stood, retrieving five
    green-gold coins of magically forged Empyrean alloy, the common trade of these lands.
    These I dropped without ceremony into the man's yellowed, eager claws. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Ah, young sir, you have been fair. May the Firebird,
    Unicorn, and Dragon bestow their blessings upon you.&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I smiled and turned to go, but was brought back by his voice once
    more. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Your name, honorable sir?&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Well. There was no harm in it, after all. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I knelt down again, and, picking up a twig, scratched in the
    dirt, &#147;Hendac, the Watcher.&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Behind his filthy mask, the old man squinted dark eyes at this,
    and spared me a quizzical look. &#147;Will you not speak to me at all, then?&#148; I shook
    my head, and before he could protest my &#147;haughty demeanor,&#148; as so many others
    have done, I scratched in the dirt; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Was born mute. Can only listen, and watch.&#148; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">&#147;Ah.&#148; The man did not know how to react to this, and
    covered by thanking me again for the coins. He retreated back into the shadows, taking
    with him the scents of cabbage and mold, and leaving me with the sharp pine fragrance of
    Shoushi. I resumed my amble through the town, considering. He did know much about those
    pathetic creatures . . . </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I halted suddenly and looked back, but he was nowhere to be seen.
    Perhaps I saw a flicker of pale yellow in the evergreens beyond, but perhaps I did not.</font><table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; color: #CC9900" id="table1">
