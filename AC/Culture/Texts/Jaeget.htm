    <p><font face="arial" size="2">
    Yesterday my brother and I began our usual hunts of the Marescent Plateau. 
    We usually did this in search of pelts and hide from the carenzi and gromnie 
    found there. It's not a very fulfilling living, but it pays the maintenance 
    on the cottage my family owns.<br>
    <br>
    While out there, we came across someone claiming to be a representative of 
    the Order of the Raven Hand. He spoke highly of his brothers and of his 
    master and even gave us a pamphlet to bring back to our cottage.<br>
    <br>
    He promised something meaningful and worthwhile out of life. I have to admit 
    that sounds a deal more satisfying than how my brother and I are living now.<br>
    <br>
    Bewren openly protested the thought of joining the Raven Hand. He said it 
    was a rash decision, and that there were organizations like it on Ispar and 
    they were hardly alliances of good. I don't believe him, I consider myself a 
    good judge of character, and this Initiate of the Raven Hand made me feel 
    nothing but safe.<br>
    <br>
    So, when Bewren wasn't looking, I pocketed the pamphlet and attached jewel, 
    and my brother and I continued on past the initiate.<br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    It has been several days since our encounter with the Raven Hand on the 
    Marescent plateau, and I can't help but think about how much better life 
    could be with them.<br>
    <br>
    Working in a world where we are appreciated, where everything we do is 
    worthwhile and special.<br>
    <br>
    I have made up my mind; I am going to crush this calling stone and invite 
    the Raven Hand to take me. And, I think while they are here I will ask him 
    to take my brother as well.<br>
    <br>
    I know he doesn't like them or want anything to do with them, but I am sure 
    once we have visited their bethel, he will come around.<br>
    <br>
    The initiate said everyone with an open mind would come around.<br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    Last night I crushed the calling stone and several members of the Raven Hand 
    arrived shortly there after.<br>
    <br>
    My brother was already asleep; I figured it would be easiest if he weren't 
    awake. The assembly hall is a work of beauty, though I have to admit it is a 
    bit dark.<br>
    <br>
    The colored lights add a nice ambience to it.<br>
    <br>
    After I had time to place the few belongings the Order allowed me to bring, 
    they began to question me, to get a feel for where my skills would best be 
    put to use, no doubt.<br>
    <br>
    I haven't seen Bewren since the other neophytes helped him off to his own 
    quarters. I wonder why they didn't allow us to stay together.<br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    Today one of the priests pulled me aside and told me my purpose. Since I had 
    a lot of skill with hides and curing, I was set to the task of flask 
    crafting.<br>
    <br>
    I was a little let down that I was not able to gather my own hides for 
    creating flasks, but the priests tell me I am not ready to leave the 
    compound yet. I trust them; they wouldn't stop me from leaving if they 
    didn't know what was best.<br>
    <br>
    My first task was a curious one.<br>
    <br>
    They issued me a kerchief to cover my mouth and nose with and tasked me with 
    creating a flask that could hold a potently enchanted beaker of Olthoi Ichor.<br>
    <br>
    The fumes gave me a headache, but I was happy. Happy, happy, happy.<br>
    <br>
    I was useful. I imagine they wanted this acid to aid them in the sculpting 
    lessons they held in the deeper levels. Why they would want to use such a 
    noxious liquid when a chisel and hammer were enough is beyond me. I mean the 
    fumes of this stuff alone could kill a man!<br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    The past week has been exhausting, but fun. So much fun I can't remember why 
    I even second-guessed coming here in the first place.<br>
    <br>
    I have finished the acid flasks that the High Priests wanted for their 
    sculpture classes and have moved on to a new project. I can't wait until I 
    get to learn how to sculpt!<br>
    <br>
    Even though I'm not sclupting flasks for Ichor anymore, I am still working 
    with the Ichor. The High Priests say we also need ceramics that can hold it, 
    for deliveries to sculpting parties in all the towns of Dereth!<br>
    <br>
    During our mid-day meal, the High Priests told us of the capture an 
    interloper named Bewren. They said he was trying to escape with our 
    sculpting secrets.<br>
    <br>
    Bewren.... That name somehow sounds familiar. I can't place it.<br>
    <br>
    I shouldn't worry about it though. It is none of my concern. All that 
    concerns me is the Order of the Raven Hand. That and their belief in 
    spreading the joys of hide crafting and sculpture through the world.<br>
    <br>
    They said the intruder, Bewren, would be properly punished and then released 
    from our home. That is enough for me, and none of my concern.<br>
    <br>
    All that concerns me is making sure the ceramics holding the sculpting acid 
    don't break.<br>
