      The brilliant rose of twilight was settling in the western sky. Serried
      rolls of clouds smoldered and caught fire in the waning light. Whirling
      flocks, over the black mass that marked the crowns of Tiofor's trees, sent
      up an ocean swell of warbling that could be heard for leagues.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I watched the sun disinterestedly, poking
      at the cold earth with a stick. It was not so different from a sunset back
      home. Perhaps the light never caught quite the same deep ember hue as
      Ispar's sun did at these times. Or perhaps it did. It was becoming hard to
      remember the old sun, the once familiar stars, the bone-colored moon that
      threw ghostly light across the blue mountainsides on the nights Grennea
      and I would steal away to kiss and clumsily clutch at each other.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I whipped the stick toward the cauldron of
      the west and grunted to my feet.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By the fire, Celdiseth was, as usual,
      sipping tea. He appeared mesmerized by the movements of the steam tendrils
      rising from his soup, watching them twist themselves into lazy corkscrews
      before disappearing. Near him, Jarilyn lay curled into a ball under my
      mother's blanket, her pale hair flowing across the grass like a river of
      diamond fire.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It had been two days since we discovered
      her. She had not spoken much -- just watched us with huge pale eyes,
      followed where we led, and walked stooped over, as if carrying a great
      boulder. I lay down on my own blankets, facing her, watching the twitching
      behind her closed eyes, and tried not to think of moonlight on the
      mountains.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We'll be leaving soon,” Celdiseth
      spoke into the rising tides of cricket song. “Kei went to the river, to
      fill our skins.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We're walking?” I said, aghast.
      “Tonight? I thought you said moving at night--”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Is dangerous. Yes, it is.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Then. . .?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I didn't say we were walking. But to
      answer your question, the Shadows are on the move tonight. It would be no
      safer staying than moving. And we'll be needed.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“How do you know?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Celdiseth tapped his forehead. “I've been
      consulting with Nuhmudira. The Arcanum has scouts in the A'mun, patrolling
      through lifestone and portal ties. The Spires are moving.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Spires are <i>always </i>moving.”
      I pulled the blanket over my head.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He curtly yanked it back down, starting
      little snaps of electricity through my hair.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“True. But not faster than a man can
      run.” His eyes impaled me with the fact.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My head jerked up. The idea of something
      that large moving that quickly. . . But still, I yawned. “They've been
      poking along for months, Master. Why should anything happen now, of all
      times?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He looked wry. “Because we are used to
      their presence, if for no other reason. Who am I to divine the thoughts of
      creatures that walked this world before even Har-- before the oldest mage
      I know was born?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I lay back, lethargic and annoyed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Master?” I said.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Where,” I said slowly, “are the
      stars?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He leapt to his feet, tea instantly knocked
      aside. Although there were vague brown clouds drifting patchily above us,
      no silver specks pierced the black. “The moons should have risen by
      now,” Celdiseth muttered to himself.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I rolled to my feet, looking east. No --
      the bloated orbs weren't there. “Are you certain?” I asked.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Quite.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kei came up beside us, occasional sloshings
      of water in the skins betraying her movement. “You see?” she said.
      “Have you seen the falling stars, too?” Celdiseth glanced at her
      sharply. She placed the skins on the ground, looked up, and said,
      “There!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We looked up again. A radiant purple
      streak, spitting fire, moved northwards.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I was once shown an ancient Empyrean
      prophecy,” Celdiseth said. “Fanzen San of Hebian-to pieced it together
      from scraps. He considered it his greatest achievement. The people who
      wrote it were almost prehistoric. Practically all we know of them comes
      second-hand, from the records of the Dericost Kingdom. Their priestesses
      were gifted at speaking auguries.” I looked at Celdiseth wonderingly. He
      seldom went on at any length about this world's history.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The prophecy said, `As our Isle of Woe
      was lost to darkness, so shall be the whole world and beyond, should the
      stars fall and the sun go out.'” He paused, as no fewer than three
      meteors, violet and rose, trailed sparks across the sky. “I was sure it
      was just a metaphor.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We packed up camp. The sky brightened
      slightly, gnawed by sourceless churning fires. “Wake Jarilyn,” Kei
      told me offhandedly, as she doused the fire with one of the skins.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I knelt beside the sleeping woman and said,
      “Jari?” She did not waken, but flinched from the noise and pulled the
      blanket tighter. I touched her shoulder to shake her from the embrace of
      the Mothers. “Jari, we're mov--”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At my touch, her eyes burst open. She
      rolled and scrambled backwards across the dirt, her mouth wide with
      horror, like a fish gasping in the dry desert above its mirror pool. She
      did not scream. If not for her ragged breathing, I would not have heard
      her. The perfect silence of her terror stung my eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Jarilyn. . .” I trembled, my hands
      tangled in each other, backed against the wall of my own chest. “We're.
      . . leaving. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. . .” She swallowed and blinked
      at me, then glanced around the clearing. After a moment, she arose, the
      rumpled folds of her peasant dress falling straight around her.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We're no longer alone,” Kei said. I
      looked up to see her regarding three dark humanoid shapes standing
      silently at the edge of the clearing. Celdiseth snatched his staff up from
      the wet ash heap that had been our fire. Kei held her torch aloft. It
      snapped at the intruders like a fierce watchdog, but did little to
      illuminate them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Master Celdiseth?” the lead figure
      called out. Her voice was a dusky contralto. It had a musical Gharu'ndim
      accent, but was oddly muffled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Aye. You've found me.” He gripped the
      staff tighter.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The three stepped out from under the eaves
      of the trees and into our torchlight. They were Gharu'n after all, dressed
      in dun-colored Dho vests and robes, with singular head wraps that hid
      their features. Celdiseth looked surprised, and bowed deeply. “Forgive
      my suspicion. I did not expect Nuhmudira would send Zharalim.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We were in the area on other
      business,” the woman said coolly. “Mistress Nuhmudira requested we
      meet you. I am tied to Cragstone. Her people have sighted two additional
      Spires moving to join the one that came out of the ground there. She
      humbly requests you aid in the defense.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We shall do what we can.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Of course, Master. So shall we all. A
      moment.” The assassin produced an orb from some hidden fold of her robe.
      It was about the size of a fist. I had never seen a mana-bearing stone of
      so small a size before. “Roiga Thiloi,” she said, and the air split
      apart. Violet light spilled from the crack for a moment before a white
      whirlpool bellowed outwards. The assassin sketched a curt bow, slipping
      the tiny orb back to wherever it had come from. “May your mission be
      successful, Master of the Arm.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yours as well, Vengeance of the Malika.”
      They bowed to each other, and the three figures melted back into the
      shadows.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What do you suppose their other business
      was?” I asked, my voice hushed, peering around at the indistinct
      foliage. We hadn't even heard them coming.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kei looked thoughtful. “I have heard that
      they seek the assassin Oswald. There is rumor that the Zharalim seek to
      end the misery of ibn Rafik. Yet, from what I have read, to kill one of
      their own would violate their code. Perhaps--”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Perhaps it's best not to ask,”
      Celdiseth said flatly. “Be grateful we have them, and leave their
      business their own. Yet. . .” His eyes, likes chips of ice, narrowed
      thoughtfully. “It would seem Nuhmudira has her fingers in more pies than
      I thought. Evaen, help Jarilyn.” He stepped into the light without
      checking to see if we were coming.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kei made a disapproving face over her
      shoulder at me. “I am certain that putting one's hands in pies cannot be
      healthy for whoever eats them.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Uh. . . It's just an old Aluvian. . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But she was gone.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jarilyn stood at my shoulder, watching me
      with dull eyes. My mother's blanket was draped over her shoulders, wrapped
      around her thin and wretched body. Small white hands at her breast
      clutched it closed around her. A fine, corn silk wisp of hair fluttered
      across her cheek in the night winds. Her scrutiny deflected my own, and I
      suddenly found the grasses by my feet very interesting. “Would you. . .
      uh. . . like to go first?” I asked the ground. Slowly, she reached for
      my hand, wrapping her fingers around my cold palm. I resisted the urge to
      twine our fingers.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Together,” she whispered. “They take
      you if you're alone.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like a ghost, she drifted into the portal.
      Her hand turned to a soft breath on my palm, and was gone.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I followed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I heard shouting a half-breath before my
      feet touched ground again.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Advocates, ta me! C'mere, curse yeh!
      There's work ta be doon.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The silver tunnel stretched and fell away.
      I stumbled away from the swarm of portal energy bubbles into a milling
      crowd. It seemed most of Cragstone was here, blinking sleep from their
      eyes and looking around in fearful uncertainty. The windows of the Hilmads'
      house blazed with light, loosing flickering yellow phantoms to dance along
      the slope of the hill. I could see one of the sisters -- Avalenne, I
      thought -- standing on the pointed eaves of the roof. She was waving a
      torch above her head and shouting, pointing in our direction. The wind
      blew her words west, beyond my hearing.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jarilyn looked around at the clamor and
      chaos with wide eyes, backing slowly toward the edge of the crowd. I
      caught her eye, then her hand, and led her out of the muddle. Celdiseth
      was consulting with a scarred, hoary warrior with the luminous shield of
      Strathelar's Order of Advocates strapped to his forearm. Kei stood by
      silently, her hands clasped in a contemplative manner.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“. . . the portal to the Spire's head is
      down by th' water,” the warrior grated. “We're about ready ta send a
      party through.” His eyes were bloodshot, and I could smell soured stout
      on his breath. I wrinkled my nose. I would have bet pyreal that he'd been
      awakened in a puddle of his own vomit. Old highland warriors are all
      alike. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“My apprentices and I will go before
      you,” Celdiseth replied. “There will be something unpleasant at the
      other end.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Aye,” the warrior said uncertainly.
      “Are yeh certain, though, Master? It's our task ta defend the towns.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“As it is mine. I didn't spend my life
      mastering magic to sit in my house and light the fireplace from across the
      room.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Advocate laughed. “As yeh say
      then.” He glanced from Kei to me, and nodded solemnly. “May the
      Mothers walk beside yeh.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Sir?” I said, gently pulling Jari
      forward. “Would you keep her safe?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“A'course, lad,” he said cheerfully.
      “Lady?” He put his hand out to her with a smile. She stared at it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I couldn't keep my baby safe,” she
      told him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Er,” the warrior said, scratching his
      beard awkwardly.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Mothers will never walk beside me
      again.” A saltwater drop spilled down her cheek.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I wanted to sing to her, to rock her gently
      to sleep.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Her name is Jarilyn,” I said,
      untangling my hand from hers. I placed her hand, thin and white, into his.
      “She was attacked by Shadows.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She looked over her shoulder at me with
      mute, tragic eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'll be back,” I told her.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Come on, Evaen,” Kei said. She was
      winding her long sable hair into a compact mass, running it through with
      small sticks of polished obsidian. Master Celdiseth was already stomping
      down the hill toward the fiery portal that floated over the riverbank,
      casting ripples across the water.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The smell of rotting meat was the first
      thing to notice. The second thing was the swooping howl, loud enough to
      split my head in twain. The third was the damp, oppressive heat, bringing
      sweat to skin that only half-existed in the world. Last, only after all
      the other senses had spoken, did the tunnel rip away from my eyes, leaving
      me trotting to an uncertain halt in the middle of red-lit horror.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Spirits defend us,” Kei breathed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The walls were bone, mostly. Across and
      through them, purple veins thudded and squirmed. As I watched, one of the
      veins distorted, a bloody eye blinking open on its side to look at us. The
      eye was quickly reabsorbed, and the vein tunneled under the protection of
      the bone. The floor was soft and wet, giving way under our boots, covered
      with a thin film of slime. It was like walking on a tongue.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And it was hot. So terribly hot. Like the
      mouth of a great monster.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the center of the chamber, broad ebony
      shoulders squared themselves. A pitch head turned. I noted glittering red
      eyes. A hiss of eager laughter. The thing held the shape of a man, from
      the waist up at least. It looked like it had been extruded from the flesh
      of the floor. I could see its skeleton through the discolored, translucent
      skin. Behind the prison bars of its ribcage, a grossly distended heart
      beat, connected to its other organs by fine tendrils of. . . something.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A Shadow Cyst. From the attacks by the
      Generals six months previous, I knew such to be the Spire's control
      center. It spread its arms wide, as if to give us a welcoming embrace.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Kei!” Celdiseth bellowed. “Recite
      the Four Cardinal Paths!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Now? </i>I thought, grunting as I ducked
      under the Cyst's opening volley of lightning.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“There are four energies that raw mana
      may be converted to.” Kei spoke Celdiseth's teaching in heavily accented
      Aluvian, the words falling from her mouth in awkward jumbles. She had not
      much practice with our tongue. “Flame is the force that consumes. When
      mana is channeled into this role, it devours the form of our opponent.”
      Celdiseth loosed a weak frost bolt at the Cyst, which brought a welcome
      drought of cool air past my face.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Acid is the force of decay. With it, we
      reduce the form of the opponent to the clay and water from which he was
      birthed.” Unable to cast while reciting, she kicked at the base of the
      Cyst. Her foot connected with a thick wet smack. Her lips curled back, and
      she did not move to attack it again. I cast a second-circle Whirling
      Blade, which sliced off its arm. The Cyst hissed again, showing me white
      teeth. Its flesh rippled. The arm reformed before my startled eyes. Then
      it sent a ball of fire squarely into my stomach, burning through my robe
      and fusing the fabric with my own skin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I screamed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The smell got worse. I felt scorched flakes
      of skin crack and peel as I breathed. I staggered away, hunched half over,
      and struggled to find the focus for a healing spell.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Frost is the force of stasis. When we
      call upon it, our foe's will is made to fight against his own stilled
      form. Lightning,” she concluded, “is the force of stimulation. When
      our mana is channeled into this path, the form of the enemy is excited
      beyond his control, and damages itself.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Good,” Celdiseth said proudly. He then
      muttered briefly, a boiling ball of light spinning up between his fingers.
      An ethereal blade of mana coalesced and flashed out, cleaving the
      abomination at what would have been its waist. Black fluid sprayed the
      entire compartment, staining our robes. The Cyst's top half slid off and
      hit the floor with a wet splat, its final breath hissing from between
      rage-clenched teeth. Its body quickly melted into thick gray jelly,
      reduced to a nearly imperceptible lump on the floor.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I blinked. It wasn't often our master made
      such a display of raw power. He usually left Kei and me to fight and
      learn, only healing and protecting us when necessary. “Sorry,” he
      said, hurrying to one of the Spire's eye sockets. “I don't think we have
      time to train after all.” I went to his shoulder and looked out.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other two Spires had arrived. Their red
      beams of light raked Cragstone's buildings like the claws of a hungry
      ursuin. The howling of our own Spire had grown markedly louder, as its
      heart nearly broiled with angry orange light.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ah!” A burning pain lanced through my
      hand. I saw a drop of the Cyst's tarry blood clinging to me, and a wisp of
      smoke hissing from my skin. I shook it off. The area of my hand, however,
      remained gray and numb. I poked at it gingerly, feeling my lips pull
      themselves back from my teeth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I think,” Celdiseth said slowly, “we
      should cause as much damage here as we can. Quickly.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Can Mistress Nuhmudira send more
      help?” Kei asked.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“She has her own problems. Tufa is
      gone.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Gone?” I couldn't wrap my thoughts
      around it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Destroyed by three Spires after she
      starting sending her people east.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“So this was a diversion,” Kei said,
      uncharacteristic bitterness poisoning her smooth voice.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Celdiseth shook his head. “We know
      Bael'Zharon's human thralls told his generals that they wanted Cragstone
      destroyed. It's at least an act of hatred. The Advocates were established
      in Cragstone. It's the capital of our land, and Queen Elysa's home.
      Brigands would see its destruction as a blow to the rule of law.”
      Celdiseth gripped his staff with both hands and turned back to the
      interior of the skull. “Let's discuss it later. Time is precious.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm not sure of everything that happened in
      the next few minutes. We attacked the interior of the skull with all our
      energies, using all the paths. We slashed and bludgeoned, froze and
      burned. The interior of the skull shrieked at our attentions, its flesh
      rippling as it healed charred and lacerated sections. But it kept
      regenerating as fast as we could hurt it. We may as well have been
      flogging the sea, as the Roulean general Xeronius did when storms
      destroyed his fleet at anchor.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A voice blasted through the confusion of my
      thoughts. <i>Get out of the Thorn! Now!</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Celdiseth cocked his head in puzzlement,
      obviously having heard it too. Kei, in the middle of a casting, blinked
      and lost track of the pattern. With a watery hiccup, the energy swirling
      around her wand dispersed in impotent sparks. After a second of
      indecision, Celdiseth grabbed her by the arm and hurled her bodily into
      the portal.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Evaen!” he bellowed across the
      chamber. “We're leaving!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“But. . .” The center of the organic
      floor stretched skyward, blue-black veins exploding like a bramble-bush,
      ropes of musculature flowing into new shapes as I watched. Miniature
      bud-limbs puckered its sides. The top swelled and folded gently over,
      acquiring milky gray spots where eyes should be. A spidery lump of tissue
      swam up through its connection with the floor, hundreds of long, whip-like
      appendages flailing, following the gelatinous spine. It attached itself to
      the throbbing heart growing in the left chest, and the whip-legs exploded,
      wrapping themselves around gummy little bones, pushing themselves against
      the interior of the skin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I could only stare at it, stumbling
      backwards, struck numb.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Its flesh blackened, and a little mouth
      split open, tarry blood spattering the veined floor. It was absorbed as
      quickly as it fell. “Aue werre,” the Cyst moaned deliriously, like a
      child in the grip of nightmare. My forehead throbbed, and a tiny voice
      whispered in my ear, “We hurt.” The veined membranes covering its eyes
      split, and the blood-red eyes pinned me to the wall with a look of
      anguish. The voice, tugging at the corners of my mind, implored, “Kill
      us. . . Kill us. . . It is eating us again. . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Damn it, boy!” Celdiseth ducked around
      the bud, clamped a steely hand around my arm, and dragged me to the
      portal. I felt a ripple in the flesh beneath my feet, and a new current
      began to flow through the humid air of the skull.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We have to. . .” I gulped queasily,
      and began to feel the pounding in my forehead that presaged one of the
      Spires' mana-shredding pulses.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We're flies stinging a mare. Go through
      the damned portal.” So saying, he shoved me from behind, and I toppled
      into the light. The luminous tunnel whirled open before me, and I slid
      through unimaginable space.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Something slammed me from behind, and I
      heard an alien shriek. The walls of the tunnel rippled and dimmed. Pain
      shuddered through me. I wondered that it should, as I was bodiless and
      falling. . .</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Limbs burning. Acidic fire crawling up
      arms and legs. Shriek -- wipe the burning away. Slides around fingers,
      dives beneath skin. The burning laughs. Razors march up along rubbery
      bones. Fingers dissolve into spray. Arms black water, dripping away to
      join the sea. Vision trembles. Black slides across vision. Blink -- lids
      burn away. Must watch. The mind afire. The black sea lunges up. No!</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Darkness. Screaming. Sliding down
      through warm weightless mud. Can't breathe! A million voices. Sliding
      across each other, falling apart, recombining. Marching, fighting. We fell
      at Cragstone. (Where is Cragstone?) We fell in the woods. (We have never
      seen these woods.) We are a liar! (No, we are!) We saw the watch fires go
      out, and heard the army shriek around us. (We have never been soldiers.)
      We were trying to find my sister. We heard her crying in the night. The
      moons went out. (We have no sister.) We were six. (We were twenty-two,
      forty-seven, four hundred sixty). We stood before the Great Old Ones in
      the mire. (Before the what?) We were taken to the moldering depths of the
      old Academy. The green light burned our eyes.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">We have no eyes!</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">We thrash. No. No arms. No legs. What
      struggles? Only essence, stripped of ego. Who are we? We are. . .</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Coming apart.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">We do. We are nothing. There is only
      all. We are the Hand. We grow.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">A great weight drags us down, compacting
      us. We become. We bend. There is a hole. It eats light. We grovel before
      It. It takes us. We are strong. It makes us strong. We are part of It.
      Thin, monotonous piping. It is all. They take It away, piece by piece.
      Cruelly, with fire. Burning away the beauty. It squeals and recoils,
      lashing at them. They imprison It in small patterns. It is not theirs. It
      precedes them. The great crime. We take It back. It becomes again.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">All one.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">We are.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Forever.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">. . . Light. . .</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I toppled out of the portal and into frigid
      waters of the Prosper, falling to my knees and gasping. Celdiseth splashed
      behind me, his breathing ragged.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Evaen?” His hand found my shoulder.
      His fingers were ice-cold and trembling. “Son, are you all right?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I vomited into the muddy water.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A woman's voice called above the howling of
      the Spires. It was deep, husky, and strong. “Celdiseth, get them as far
      from it as you can!” I wanted to look up, to see who owned this
      marvelous voice, but I could only retch pathetically into the cloudy
      water, bile flowing from my nose and eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Come on, son. It may pass in a minute.
      Kei, help me. Gently.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arms looped under my shoulders. “What
      happened to him?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Spire pulses have. . . ah, amplified
      effects in portalspace.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Revolting,” I mumbled, drooling numbly
      on my destroyed robe. “It was--” But another fit of nausea folded me
      in half at the thought. They lifted and carried me, stumbling, up the hill
      to where the windmill creaked defiantly before the oncoming Spires.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Advocates!” the woman's voice called.
      “Volley fire on my mark! Use frog crotch arrows if you have them, and
      aim for the heart!” I looked up to see a tall, proud woman silhouetted
      by torchlight. Her hair was long, unbound, the color of dry wheat at
      harvest time. It fell in thick, unkempt waves to the small of her back, a
      few errant corkscrew strands framing her face. She wore simple studded
      leather armor, the knees and elbows plated with what appeared to be purple
      Olthoi chitin. She wielded a magnificent longbow, whose wood glowed
      faintly green.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On either side of her, yet a step behind,
      stood a line of archers and mages. She looked around, checking their
      readiness. Most had a line of arrows stuck in the earth before them. As
      her eyes slid over them, I caught her glance for a bare moment. Her mouth
      was set in a grim, stolid line. Her eyes, crinkled with crow's feet, were
      ice blue, as if they cupped a heavy draught from the River of Sorrow.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ready!” she hollered. Her hand dipped
      down to pluck one of the arrows from the ground before her. I started. As
      it cleared the earth, a ball of frigid, blue-white light ignited around
      the silver arrowhead. With the creak of an enormous rocking-chair, a dozen
      archers nocked arrows and drew back their bowstrings.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Loose!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Arrows flew. The woman's trailed a spectrum
      of light behind it. A half-breath later, Whirling Blades tumbled after the
      arrows. They sailed across the night sky and hit the heart of the Spire
      more or less as one. The rainbow arrow struck true and penetrated the
      flickering heart. After half a moment, a white explosion went off in the
      organ, and the Spire squealed. A small avalanche of fluid and viscera
      spilled from the rent the arrow had torn in its side. An uncertain cheer
      went up from the line. The angry red lights of the Spires continued to
      intensify.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ready! Loose!” Again, the arrows and
      mana blades reached out to nick the Spire. Again and again they fired,
      keeping a steady pace. Warriors, unable to combat the hovering enemy,
      planted fresh arrows in the ground before the archers, or carried reagents
      to mages who had run out. The air stank with the thunderstorm scent of
      burning mana.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Our spells are weakening,” Celdiseth
      called. “We're casting too much for the local field to sustain.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I know,” the archer yelled back.
      “Ready! Just a few moments. Loose!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a hum, and faint violet lambency,
      rippling like moonlight off water, carved my wavering shadow across the
      ground before me. I turned. A new mage, dressed in a white robe with blue
      and violet trim, stepped out of portalspace.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hold your strings! Fall back north --
      get behind the crest of the hill! No, leave the arrows. Go. Go!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I stood up. He was over six feet tall,
      wraith-slender, and golden-eyed. His gaze locked on to the grotesque
      Spire, and he began, almost subliminally, to make arcane gestures with
      both hands. I watched him, puzzled. Where was his. . .?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Zojak Quaau!” he cried suddenly,
      throwing his empty hands to the roiling heavens.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The passage of moments slowed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They dripped by.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A glacier melting.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Drop.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By drop.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Clear water.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I saw everything.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">White light, dazzling as the sun off
      Luparvium snow, flooded my view. Warmth coursed over me in torrents,
      raising all the hair on my arms and head. A star, a sphere of pure light,
      spun and flared between the white mage's fingertips. It launched itself
      from his outstretched hands, bowing his body with the strain of casting.
      Delicate coronal wisps trailed from it, like gauze or a spider's web, as
      it passed over our heads. Slowly, it seemed, it rolled up towards the
      Spire, leaving a subtle rainbow across the night air to mark its passage.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although she was behind me, I could sense
      Kei as a radiant impression of curiosity and wonder, as a warmth upon my
      back. Celdiseth, at my side, was a dark, mighty knot of worry, fluttering
      like a proud old hawk with a broken wing. I could smell the small flowers
      crushed beneath my feet, and hear tiny insects frantically digging
      themselves deeper underground. I could see every leaf on every tree along
      the shore as they showed their pale undersides in the wind. I saw a
      miniscule hole in the bark of a sapling on the shore, and knew that it was
      the abode of a small worm, hibernating until it could be reborn as a tiny
      winged insect that would live but one day. I could have wept for its
      tragedy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>This is not our magic. Our magic doesn't
      do this. </i>It was as if I'd spent my life half asleep, and had only now
      fully awoken.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The star reached up to disperse the
      darkness looming over Cragstone. It illuminated every fissure and patch of
      wetness on the Spire's rubbery hide. It brushed the roughly weathered
      knobs of bone; it filled the empty eye sockets with radiance. The thing's
      pulsing heart recoiled from its approach.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The light blistered the shore, turned water
      to cloud, and went out.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Waves of roaring lanced my ears, gathering
      in strength, each mightier than the last. In the depths of the noise, I
      heard for a moment a multitude of voices crying in release, and above them
      all a single ringing note, as from a bell of pure silver resounding
      endlessly. My hearing gave out before the noise did, and I was plunged
      into silence.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The earth leapt up beneath us. A massive
      weight knocked into my chest, ripping the breath from my throat and
      tumbling me like a scarecrow in the wind.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I raised my head from the dust and ash,
      blinked at the swarms of shapeless green blobs that wobbled across my
      vision. The head of the Spire was gone, its neck bleeding thick black
      liquid, its heart shriveled into a gray, papery bag.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It began to fall.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Slowly, then with gathering speed, the
      black dagger toppled back away from the town, trailing putrescent green
      flame. Seams banded its length. They widened into cracks, and then the
      Spire broke into pieces. I dizzily imagined it as sounding like a series
      of hideous wet cracks, like bones being snapped. The pieces separated,
      shouldering aside the gouts of mist that hovered over the boiling water.
      White plumes flew upwards in its wake, curling over at the tips to settle
      again.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There must have been a tremendous noise
      when the pieces hit, but all I could hear after the blast was a thick
      hissing. The sound of their impacts came to me as if from a great
      distance. Fuliginous water sloshed into the walls of the great crater that
      ringed its death place. The inner rim was all roasted mud from the bottom
      of the river. I gaped at it, not comprehending. A moment before, the great
      arms of this crater simply had not been there.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Slowly, a tenuous golden mist rose from the
      chunks of the Spire. It gathered above the face of the frothing waters,
      into a great manta-winged shape unlike anything I had seen on this world
      or the last. A long, luminescent neck lifted to the sky.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Sisters! I am free! I come anon!</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the depths of the empty sky, a distant
      echo of joy lit upon the grass around us like spring dew. Tears stung my
      eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The golden mist lost its luminosity, and
      was gently brushed away by the soft caress of the wind off the river. I
      thought I could catch the faintest scent of wild calanna blossoms, the
      sweet smell of home and hearth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I fell to my knees, unashamedly letting the
      tears wash my cheeks. A causeless jubilation held my sides tight, so
      overwhelming I could scarcely breathe. “Sweet Mothers,” I sobbed, but
      couldn't hear my own words after the holocaust of sound.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And then. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was asleep again, the tears drying cool
      and sticky on my face. The smell of over-boiled fish spoiled the air.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I looked behind me to see Kei, kneeling in
      what looked like a prayerful pose. Celdiseth staggered to his feet, looked
      out at the crater, and rubbed his jaw thoughtfully. The white mage
      stumbled towards the river, boneless with fatigue. His face was as pale as
      his robe. The archer, absently sweeping a long, wheat-colored curl out of
      her eyes, set herself under his shoulder and helped him down the hill.
      “. . . Haven't been this drained since the Sundering,” I heard him say
      as they approached. I stuck my finger in my ear. It felt as if I had a
      candle shoved into it, preventing me from hearing properly.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two remaining Spires, shrieking with
      impotent rage, boiled away to the northeast. Soon they passed from our
      sight behind the hills and trees.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Only one,” the white mage groaned,
      sliding out of the archer's grasp to sit heavily on the charred earth.
      “Only one. . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She laid her hand upon his shoulder. “One
      more than there has been for two millennia.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You,” Celdiseth grunted. The mage
      looked up.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Celdiseth,” he said, politely. “I
      told you once that if the Hopeslayer was loosed, the consequences would be
      far more dire than you imagined.” He paused, his golden eyes looking
      over our Master's bloodied, torn robe, the discolorations where the Shadow
      Cyst had spattered its ichor. “You understand now the enormity of what
      we face?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes,” Celdiseth said. “Where the
      hell have you been?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I sucked in a breath. Never one to mix
      words, our Master.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We have been. . .” The mage hesitated,
      and glanced up at the archer. She shrugged, a gentle, almost imperceptible
      movement of one shoulder. “We have been grieving. For the lost. And
      then, we were planning. But when we heard the Enemy was moving on
      Cragstone. . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What comedy!” The archmage of
      Cragstone leapt agilely down the ashen hillside bearing a torch, black
      eyes narrowed in spite. “After all this time, you only fell one? Two
      escaped! What kind of guardian do you pretend to be, oh mighty lord?” he
      sneered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“And how many Spires have you defeated,
      Langarl?” the archer said coldly. “For that matter, where were you
      during the battle? I marked Master Celdiseth, his pupils, and the
      Advocates, but you were nowhere to be seen.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I have never claimed to be a
      guardian,” the white mage whispered to the ground. “I have only been
      called so.” I doubt anyone besides the archer and I heard him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gondibyr Langarl's sloe-eyes tightened in
      rage, and he seemed to acquire more than his usual stature. I did not like
      the way the shadows fell upon his face in the guttering light of his
      firebrand. He opened his mouth to rebut, but Kei spoke quietly. “Sir?”
      She did not move or look up from her meditation. The white mage turned his
      tired eyes to her. “Tufa was also attacked, my lord,” she said. “It
      was destroyed.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I know,” he said. His eyes floated
      down to the steaming wreckage that lay sprawled across Cragstone's new
      bay, the pale corpses of fish bobbing in the ash-blackened water. “We
      could only defend against one. I pray that we chose to make our stand at
      the right. . .” Then, he flinched, and went pale as frost. The archer
      looked up and away to the northeast, where a great light washed over the
      trees with violet-blue fire.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Arwic,” she whispered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Black, triumphant laughter seemed to ride
      behind the noise of the wind.</font></td>
