    An account by Lord Alashorn, Diplomat of the Seaborne Empire of Yalain, 
    Ambassador to the Court of His Majesty King Braletain of Haebrous. <br>
    <br>
    It was the fifth year of the reign of His Majesty King Braletain when the 
    Barbarian first arrived. Our cousins the Haebreans constantly seek to 
    explore and civilize the wild lands to the north of their kingdom, and each 
    season an expedition returns to the capital with newly discovered animals in 
    cages, to serve as a court curiosity. Indeed, the Royal Menagerie is a 
    constant source of delight for my children and for visiting dignitaries from 
    home. <br>
    <br>
    As I was saying, the Barbarian came to the capital in a frontier 
    expedition's cage in the fifth year of Braletain's rule. He was the last 
    survivor of a tribe of semi-civilized brutes at the frigid northern edge of 
    the King's domain. The rest of the tribe had been extinguished to make way 
    for a mercantile company's gemstone excavations, and they were deemed too 
    wild and dangerous to leave alone. <br>
    <br>
    He was a most impressive physical specimen: long of limb, thickly muscled, 
    with alert eyes and the proud, savage bearing of a born killer. He was not 
    as tall as I am, but with his overdeveloped physique, he easily weighed as 
    much as two of me. He spoke a language, of a sort, and royal linguists 
    eventually deciphered enough of his speech to learn that he called himself &quot;Grael&quot; 
    and to enable his future masters to issue him basic orders. <br>
    <br>
    It was Braletain's young Queen, Carraida, who first realized the Barbarian's 
    potential. On the day that the expedition returned with their captive, the 
    King feasted their leaders in the palace. I was present for this banquet, 
    and King and Queen were enthralled by the tales of the vicious fight that 
    the brutes had put up in defense of their village. Grael's powerful bearing 
    and proud posture, even in chains, impressed them equally. The Queen begged 
    her royal husband to send the captive to the gladiatorial pits for her 
    amusement. <br>
    <br>
    To say that Grael flourished as a gladiator would be an understatement. He 
    vanquished every foe and every beast in the ring. He overpowered the strong, 
    battered the tough, ran down the quick, outfought the skilled. He ended 
    every match by decapitating his fallen enemy and devouring his heart, right 
    there at the center of the ring. His eyes glowed red as he fought, and 
    flared brightly when he ate a warm heart. I do not think there has ever been 
    a spectacle like Grael's great combats. <br>
    <br>
    Grael had been fighting for two seasons when his rebellion erupted upon the 
    city. The event was an &quot;Empty Cells Battle&quot;, where all the gladiators were 
    released from their cells and put in the ring. Unknown to the arena guards, 
    Grael had convinced a large group of fellow slaves, about half of them, to 
    join him in rebellion. United in their fighting, they quickly slew all the 
    other slaves, and then scaled the walls of the arena. Their actions were so 
    sudden and unexpected, they overpowered the arena guards and took over the 
    entire building. <br>
    <br>
    Ten thousand Haebreans and no small number of visiting Yalaini and 
    Dericostians died. The King had been absent from the arena that day, but the 
    Queen was there. Her <span lang="en-us">g</span>uards were killed by the 
    united slaves, and the Queen became the object of Grael's personal 
    vengeance. Apparently he remembered her from his presentation to the royal 
    couple. The Queen was beheaded in the center of the arena, as she knelt in 
    the ankle-deep blood of her subjects. Grael devoured her heart and flung her 
    head over the wall and into the street. <br>
    <br>
    I wish I could say that the King's vengeance was swift. Grael's slaves 
    fought running battles in the streets with the city watch, inflicting 
    horrific casualties on townsfolk and guards alike. Dozens of buildings 
    burned in the chaos. I was one of many who fled the city. It was on the 
    third day of the rebellion that the royal army finally managed to muster and 
    run the rebels to ground in the West Market. Once they were isolated and 
    surrounded, the King ordered the royal mages to incinerate the entire market 
    square with a rain of magical fire that lasted almost a full day. <br>
    <br>
    Those few that escaped the flames were put to the sword by the encircling 
    army, and their heads were mounted on the gates of the reconstructed 
    fighting arena. The King was never the same after that<span lang="en-us">
    </span>outburst of horror. Twenty years later, he is a ruined and wasted 
    man, a shadow of the strong and admirable leader he had been. His weakness 
    has emboldened the ever-grasping Dericostians, there is no clear and 
    qualified successor, and I fear war will come soon between the Kingdoms. <br>
    <br>
    As for Grael... his fate remains unknown. No soldier could recall seeing him 
    among the fighters on that last day of blood and fire. No remains were found 
    - neither corpse nor blackened bone. There is still a royal bounty on his 
    head, richer than any in the history of Haebrous. But it seems that the 
    gladiator rebel vanished completely. Perhaps he lurks in the wilderness even 
    today, plotting bloody revenge against the King and people who destroyed his 
    home.</font></td>
