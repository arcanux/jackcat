	<p><font size="2" face="arial">With respect to His Eternal Splendor,<br>
	<br>
	This humble servant presents an account to your lordship of our first 
	contact with the being known only as the Spear of Mukkir. <br>
	<br>
	My Lord's knights and captains came across the beast laying upon the south 
	western shores of Killiakti, within viewing sight of the indulgent Yalain 
	retreat. For days, the beast slept fitfully, snarling and speaking in an 
	unrecognizable tongue. We were completely at a loss for what it was saying, 
	with the exception of the word &quot;Braletain&quot;. This beast was aware of the 
	Braletain lineage of Haebrous, though what association it had with them is 
	beyond our knowledge.<br>
	<br>
	A fortnight of agitated slumber gave way to a shocking awakening. No sooner 
	had one of our scholars arrived (one whose focus was the recorded history of 
	the Haebrous empire), than had the beast laid waste to a dozen of our 
	bravest skeletons. However, the beast was weakened, hungry, and found no 
	sustenance in our fleshless warriors. It was rapidly subdued yet again, and 
	our scholar began work on deciphering its guttural speech.<br>
	<br>
	&gt;From his short time with the beast (meaning the few hours before it turned 
	on the scholar, shattered his chest and ate the scholar's desiccated heart), 
	we were informed that it was the fabled beast known as the Spear of Mukkir. 
	Our records show that such a being once existed in the lands of Haebrous, 
	though its appearance was more akin to a heavily muscled Haebrean than the 
	scaled creature it now was.<br>
	<br>
	Our libraries indicate that a savage from a tribe to the north of the 
	Haebrous territories was captured and brought before the ruling crown of the 
	time, King Braletain of Haebrous. At his queen's behest, Braletain subjected 
	the Spear of Mukkir to life in the gladiatorial pits. As time led on, the 
	Spear of Mukkir gathered an army of slaves and fought their way from the 
	pits and savaged the kingdom, killing many, including Braletain's young 
	wife, Queen Carraida. Days of pillaging and savagery reigned over the city 
	until, without warning or notice, the Spear of Mukkir disappeared.<br>
	<br>
	And now, My Lord, this creature appears. Our scholars connect it to the 
	Spear of Mukkir. It may even be one and the same. However, we have been 
	unable to tame the rage within it and bring its might beneath our control. 
	It is with this that I, ever your humble servant and prefect, request we 
	contain the beast until such a time that we may better control its 
	potential.<br>
	<br>
	The sisters, from whom we derive our longevity, are known to have once held 
	the means to contain the essences of others within enchanted crystals. I 
	respectfully request leave for myself and a small accompaniment of scholars 
	to scour your ancient libraries for a means to contain this beast of 
	darkness so that we may in time devise a method to control it. With each 
	passing day, darkness edges closer and closer to our haven, as if reaching 
	and striving to meet with our savage visitor.<br>
	<br>
	Until such a time that a decision is reached, we shall continue to cage the 
	Spear of Mukkir and provide it sustenance as needed. Thankfully, Killiakti 
	is no stranger to Yalaini wanderers. Their hearts should be sufficient to 
	sate the beast's hunger and calm its spirits. Let us hope that it does not 
	manage to free itself yet again.<br>
	<br>
	Your humble and faithful servant,<br>
	<br>
