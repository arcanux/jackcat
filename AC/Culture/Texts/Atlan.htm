      <font size="2" face="Arial">
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Esteemed chevairds and soldiers of the Yalain Empire, I am Atlan,
    Lord of the island of Knorr at the behest and indulgence of our most Dignified and Serene
    Emperor Caerlin. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">We find ourselves in a time of crisis. Unknown assailants ravage
    the north, and abduct our own children from their very beds as far south as the coastal
    ports in the region of the great port at Nesortania. The nature of the enemy has thus far
    eluded our most learned sages. My wife Lady Maila, Master of the Lyceum at Knorr,
    continues to lead her students in the investigation. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">In the meantime, as unseemly as it may be in our enlightened
    society, I have undertaken a project which may assist our efforts against the unknown
    aggressor. As you may know, as well as being a captain of armies, I am an alchemist of
    some repute. With the assistance of Lady Maila, I have designed a set of pyreal-based
    weapons whose flexibility and power is unsurpassed in our history of arms. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">The basis of this system, is, of course, the enchanted alloy
    pyreal, which may only be refined and forged by the most skilled of alchemists in the
    molten heart of certain volcanic mountains. A quantity of pyreal must therefore be
    gathered and alchemically refined before anything further may be done. As ever, pyreal may
    be of superior or inferior quality, and this does directly effect the quality of the
    resulting weapon. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#ffffff">Once a complete ingot of pyreal has been assembled, the material
    must be forged into a weapon. This is a time-consuming process, and one which debilitates
    even the staunchest of alchemists. To speed the process, my Lady Maila has created a new
    breed of Golem. Based on the Magma Golems we use to protect our pyreal 
      foundries, it is able to follow simple directions to produce a certain 
      type of weapon<span lang="en-us">.</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Essentially, the Golem is trained to recognize certain glyphs,
    and actually reshape the pyreal it is given within its own molten form. The glyphs
    themselves are enchanted, naturally, and adapt themselves to the skill of the user. For
    example, if a warrior should try to apply a mace glyph to a pyreal ingot, it will sense
    how great his skill at the mace, and remember it. If his level of expertise is high, the
    Golem will produce a mighty weapon for him. If he is less skilled, it will create a mace
    more suited to his own modest ability. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">In addition, Lady Maila has added a further enhancement of her
    own. She has crafted a set of enchanted elemental sourcestones which may be added to the
    weapons. There are crystals which bear the powers of acid, fire, frost, and lightning.
    Each enhances the weapon with a variety of enchantments. A given stone may be removed from
    the weapon at any time using a special tool, and then replaced. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Thus, a warrior may exchange his flaming axe for a frost axe,
    acid axe, or lightning axe at will, without burdening himself with three extra weapons. I
    trust my warrior colleagues will see the benefits of this system as well as I do. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Further, the stones may be fit into any type of weapon. The same
    fire stone may be fit into both a spear and a sword. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Warriors should be cautioned that with excessive use, both the
    elemental stones and the tool used to remove them may break. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Maila has taught several of her students how to create the Golem
    and the stones, and they stand ready to leave for our various foundries, to begin work. I
    have taken the liberty of beginning to arm my own household guard with these weapons. I
    have taken the first of these, a superb crimson sword I have named Rez'arel, as my
    personal weapon. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I regret to say that while the elemental stones fashioned by my
    Lady and her fellow Master Enchanters are of exacting quality, the process of creation
    daunts most. We may be forced to rely on lesser mages to produce enough stones for the
    army. These will be of lesser quality, and will not give a weapon elemental damage
    ability. They should still serve ably. </font></font></td>
