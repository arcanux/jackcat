      in Musansayn's House.</font></em>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The sun then descended back into the
      springs of the world, and the moon began to ascend in her place. The
      evening clouds over the darker limb of the land muttered and answered each
      other in blue and white flashes. Ma'yani floated along the courses of the
      river, the sky filling with jewels beyond the ken of any Malik. The
      greenery dropped away, and the face of the brown water was sprinkled with
      fine dust, and Ma'yani knew then that this was the edge of the great Naqut,
      which divides the land of Milantos from the decaying Roulean Empire. Here
      it was that the people known as Gharu'ndim lived and live.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the edge of the bank there appeared a
      village, beaten to a pale brown by the sun. On the bank sat a traveler,
      who dipped a skin into the river, filled it, and brought it to his lips.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he sat, drinking, a pillar of steam
      erupted from the ground, and demon Hayyaz stepped out of the steam, and
      was the steam. The traveler looked upon the form of the demon, but merely
      continued to drink.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">'This village is mine, stranger,' said
      Hayyaz. 'If you wish to drink my water and live, you must do me homage.'
      From the shadowed doorways, the lost eyes of children and women reflected
      torchlight.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">'Indeed,' said the traveler, 'if this water
      is yours, then I have truly done you wrong.'</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">'It is mine,' said the demon, 'and I do not
      yet see the back of your neck.'</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">'Forgive me,' the traveler said, and rose
      to his feet. 'I am new to these lands. I shall return that which I have
      taken unearned.' And at that, he doused the demon Hayyaz with the water
      from his skin, and with a terrible cry, it was no more.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The traveler then sat beside the stream
      again, and drew more water into his skin. 'Now,' he said, 'I have earned
      it.' So saying, he drank deeply of the river.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A woman, frail from sun and work, stumbled
      from the nearest hut, and cried, 'Who are you, who has delivered us?'</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">'I am Rakhil al-Khur,' the traveler said.
      'I go north to Roulea. Will you follow me?'</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the people swore their loyalty to the
      traveler, Ma'yani was swept around a bend in the river, and saw the
      village no more.</font></p>
