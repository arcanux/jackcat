    <p><font face="arial" size="2">
    While we were fur hunting on the Marescent Plateau yesterday, Jaeget and I 
    were approached by a man proclaiming to be capable of making our lives 
    meaningful. <br>
    <br>
    Right away, I realized what he was and that he was up to no good. <br>
    <br>
    There were similar groups on Ispar. They would coerce others into joining 
    their following and those people would never be heard from again.<br>
    <br>
    Poor Jaeget wasn't alive on Ispar but four years, so luckily he didn't have 
    to confront any of those types. <br>
    <br>
    I know he isn't happy with everything about his life now, but I also know 
    this Order of the Raven hand isn't something he wants to be involved with.
    <br>
    <br>
    I recommended we move on. Despite my protest, he took one of their 
    pamphlets... I am sure he believes I didn't notice the note passing.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Jaeget has done nothing but yammer on about the Order of the Raven Hand 
    since we ran across the recruiter on Marae nearly a week ago. <br>
    <br>
    What's worse, his being taken with their beliefs has hurt business. <br>
    <br>
    We don't have nearly enough hides to sell as we used to.<br>
    <br>
    I would suggest another trip to Marae, though I fear bringing him there 
    would only further advance his desire to join the Raven Hand.<br>
    <br>
    He is all I have left of Ispar and I do not want to lose him like we lost 
    Mother and Father in Holtburg all those years ago.<br>
    <br>
    Tomorrow I will find that pamphlet and burn it. Perhaps without the 
    pamphlet, he will forget this cult and return to normal.<br>
    <br>
    ----<br>
    <br>
    I awoke only briefly last night to see my cot surrounded by several men 
    swathed in dark cloaks. In the background I could see them embracing Jaeget 
    and then everything went dark.<br>
    <br>
    I awoke within a cage in some strange hall. Within the cell with me was 
    another person, a very fidgety fellow who went by the name of Twitch.<br>
    <br>
    His tale was one of woe, though after learning of his previous 
    accommodations, this place seemed more hospitable than what he had 
    previously... but only slightly.<br>
    <br>
    Our guards ignored our shouts, and only once did I see Jaeget after waking, 
    and then it was only in passing and he did not seem to notice me.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I've been here for some time now, and I am tired of being here. I have no 
    weapons, no lock picks, and no way of getting both my brother and I out of 
    here safely. <br>
    <br>
    Twitch seems to have been here slightly longer than I, and did have some 
    insight, though it was difficult to understand between his shivering and 
    short attention span.<br>
    <br>
    When the guard comes to deliver our meal, I will liberate his key-ring and 
    escape after curfew has gone into effect. On my way out, I will glean what 
    information I can from the surrounding temple and note where entrances and 
    exits are.<br>
    <br>
    My attempt at escape failed. The Priests captured me as I made way to the 
    exit. <br>
    <br>
    Struggling, they threw me before what I can only describe as a vile cloud of 
    soot and liquid and forced me to breathe it in.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Even now my head spins and charcoal-black cysts are beginning to form on my 
    arms and face... I do not know what they did to me, but I know what they 
    plan. I have been moved away from Twitch and placed in some interim holding 
    cell. Looking out into the room, I can see a pit of some sort.<br>
    <br>
    Earlier today a procession of cultists marched into the room, one of them my 
    brother. His eyes seemed glazed and he bore no recognition for me. It was as 
    I feared. Not only are they about to take my life, but they have taken his 
    as well.<br>
