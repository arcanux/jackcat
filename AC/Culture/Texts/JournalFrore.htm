	<font face="Arial" size="2"><i>By Chris L'Etoile</i> </font></p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">During the now-famous Sudden Season, adventurers 
	tracked the source of an unnatural winter to the lost city of Frore, where 
	Gelidite necromancers had enchanted a vast floating gemstone to drain the 
	world's heat. The following journal, taken from a slain Gelidite, reveals a 
	little of the necromancers' history and motives, and suggests that they did 
	not fully understand the magic they tried to control. </font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>It has been a month since the first of the 
	barbarians assaulted the gates -- a month of constant assaults and combat, 
	with but a few hours of respite before the next wave threw itself at us. 
	Most are berserkers, attacking with none of the finesse shown even by the 
	Yalain, our old oppressors. They have little knowledge of magic beyond brute 
	force. Yet many have shown the cunning and persistence of the rats that live 
	in the tunnels below the city.</i> </font></p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><i>After a thousand years of work -- ten 
	thousand years of exile -- we are finished. The Council of Three, Blessed 
	Fenngar, Ferundi, and Frisander, have been slain. Their bodies lie at the 
	upper gates, battered and blistered to a final death by the barbarians. The 
	outlanders swept through the tunnels, and Frore below, killing all the 
	Initiates and Acolytes who dared oppose them, reducing our golem servants to 
	rubble. The squares and passages are littered with corpses. We now have but 
	a pitiful remnant of our forces.</i> </font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>So many years we spent, weaving our spells 
	around our Great Work, bending it to our needs. At last the heat of the deep 
	earth was being drawn into it, contained. The world had cooled. Snow covered 
	the deserts. Soon it would have been a frozen wasteland, suited only to 
	ourselves. With all our enemies dead, we could finally return to Gelid. The 
	Old Lords which revile us, the barbarians, the Olthoi . . . that idiot boy 
	of Yalain sitting smug and aloof in his lofty fortress -- all would have 
	passed into ice and memory.</i> </font></p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><i>When the Work was assaulted, to our own 
	surprise it defended itself like a living creature, casting flame spells of 
	incredible strength. It slew many, drove the others back again and again, 
	regenerating with astonishing speed. In the end, however, it was 
	overwhelmed. The Great Work of Frore lies shattered, bleeding its warmth 
	back into the undeserving earth.</i> </font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>There is a darkness now where the Work 
	fell. No matter how much light we place in the room, that spot remains dim 
	and strange. I cannot explain it. Perhaps Frisirth, with his intuitive 
	understanding of the Work, could have.</i> </font></p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><i>How did we come to this? The ancient 
	prophecies of the Falatacot said the Fourth Sending would begin in a city of 
	Dericost named Frore. We were the nobility of High Gelid, Dericost's royal 
	province. We established Frore to fulfill the prophecy, and extended our 
	lives at terrible cost to buy the needed time. Yet we are broken, and the 
	world recovers from our near-success. For this we fled the lands of the 
	Yalain? For this we accepted the ritual of undeath, the burden of rotting 
	flesh?</i> </font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>We have been our own gods. Perhaps the old 
	gods have brought us low to teach us humility again. I mean the gods of the 
	swamp and the deep earth, the true gods of terrible aspect who live in 
	ageless splendor.</i> </font></p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><i>These walls of stone and marble have long 
	seemed to me an enclosing womb, protecting us from the unearned enemies we 
	have suffered for millennia. We came here to build a holy city, from which 
	we might return home in triumph after our long exile. Now, I look at the 
	walls, and can only think of them cracking and crumbling, collapsing inward, 
	burying us in the vault of eternity into which so many of the Old Lords were 
	thrown.</i> </font>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>I rest uneasy, when rest can be had. I 
	feel cold.</i> </font></p>
