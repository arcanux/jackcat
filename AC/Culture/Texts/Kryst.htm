    Purchased from Natalie the Scribe in Kryst - 74.5S, 84.9E</font></span><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Kryst has a long and rich
      background that is rooted in hope. It was founded by Zenzaburou Hensu
      after the tribulations of the Olthoi. During the Dark times, when all of
      the children of Ispar were slaves made to toil under the heavy yoke of
      Olthoi oppression, there truly was no hope of overcoming our taskmasters.
      So, Zenzaburou Vanten the Archmage (note: then the Quick. How times
      change...), and Vesayen Hylin gathered together to plan.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It was during these times
      that the hope within our hearts was the most fragile. The Olthoi were
      capable of anticipating the actions of any slave with crystalline clarity,
      and had foiled many different escape attempts by coordinating their
      movements as if guided by one mind. It seemed as if all the things that
      Zenzaburou had talked about would never come to fruition when a strange
      earthquake occurred. After the rocks had finished shifting, and the
      tunnels had been flooded with dust, they decided to act. They quickly
      organized the other slaves, guiding them away from their Olthoi
      taskmasters under the cover of darkness.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Imagine if you will the
      fear that we felt as we traveled. Olthoi nests are dark, and the walls
      seem to be living. At any moment we could have seen the glowing red eyes
      of our masters and been undone. There were in fact many slaves that were
      simply to scared to move or talk, unless prodded by one of their masters.
      Fear is a powerful tool.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We exited the nest through
      one of the Rifts in space, and were greeted by the sun. For many of us,
      this was a welcome reprieve. For some of us, like Vesayen's daughter
      Sharon, this was the first time she had seen the sun on Dereth. The sight
      was so beautiful to her, she cried for the first time since she had been
      taken into captivity.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It seems that we were too
      overconfident. Our former masters were quite unwilling to part with us
      just yet, and pursued us out into the forest. Many of the younger children
      fell behind. Their cries still haunt my sleep to this night. Those of us
      that were hardy enough to press on managed to, regardless of how weak or
      tired we were.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fortunately, luck smiled on
      us, for we happened to come across another Rift in space. Zenzaburou and
      Vesayen ushered us through the portal, intent on staying until the last of
      us had gone through the portal. I grabbed Sharon, pulling her away from
      her father and into the swirling rift. That was to be the last time she
      would ever see her father, and the last time she would ever cry, to my
      knowledge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Zenzaburou barely pulled
      himself through the portal before it flickered and began to fade. His
      clothes were bloodstained, and his knuckles were split and bruised. The
      last of us, twenty in all, gathered are wits and assessed our
      surroundings.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The terrain was like
      nothing we had ever seen before, however the ominous chittering of Olthoi
      was strangely absent. This lent us heart, and we pressed on into the woods
      until we found a reasonably large clearing.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After time passed, we
      founded the village of Kryst, in the knowledge that we may very well have
      been the last bastion of Ispar left that was independent from the Olthoi
      Horde. The jungle was not without its inherent dangers, and the savage
      mosswarts and brutish predators succeeded in claiming some of our numbers
      regardless of Zenzaburou and Vanten's best efforts. This lack of safety
      resulted in some of the people leaving, for they felt they could ensure
      their continued well being far more than Zenzaburou could. They have not
      been heard from in some time, but there are those amongst us that still
      believe they live, further in the Vesayen Isles.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now, other Isparians have
      come, revealing that the Olthoi no longer plague our kind. Instead, they
      come bearing tales of Shadows that walk like men, and of slain hope. Only
      time will reveal what we have missed.</font>
