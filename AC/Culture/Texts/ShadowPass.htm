    <align="left"><font class="BaseMsgFont"><font face="Arial"><small>The 
	fighting was fierce today. Not that such carnage is unusual for this war, 
	but this is the first time since our arrival that I personally have seen so 
	many die in the course of a single day.<br>
	<br>
	When we struck camp this morning, Sir Furlaine declared his intent to march 
	through the Shadow Pass. Eleonora exploded in anger at this decision. The 
	pass was a perfect place for an ambush. If Varicci's men were to attack us, 
	we would stand little chance of survival.<br>
	<br>
	But the pass was the easiest and quickest way to the outpost, and Sir 
	Furlaine believed that Varicci would never send his troops to such a 
	reputedly haunted place. Eleonora hated the decision. She argued with him 
	for more than an hour. But the command belonged to Sir Furlaine. She had no 
	choice but to accede.<br>
	<br>
	It was probably best for all of us that Sir Furlaine was killed in that 
	first volley of arrows. No doubt, he would have doomed the lot of us had he 
	survived. And he clearly would not have won the victory that Eleonara did.<br>
	<br>
	The Loyalists were perched on the valley wall. They had a clear shot at us. 
	Their arrows fell upon us like rain. Oh, the hooro of it. They gave no 
	warning cry, no offer to turn and flee. They simply fired.<br>
	<br>
	Twenty men were felled with the first volley. I would have been one of them 
	had not Sir Bellas shielded me with hi Kul'dir just before the arrow reached 
	me. Men screamed and died. Several of our archers fired back, but their 
	arrows bounced harmlessly against the valley walls.<br>
	<br>
	Eleonar took up a dead knight's shield and retrieve Furlaine's banner. She 
	gathered the knights around her, shouting over the screams of the dying. 
	They lifted their shield so that the arrows could not get through. Those of 
	us without shields either took them from the dead or huddled close to a 
	shielded knight.<br>
	<br>
	Then she did something quite unexpected. She ordered us up the valley wall. 
	Toward Varicci's forces.<br>
	<br>
	It was slow going. The wall was steep and we struggled to stay afoot. Many 
	failed. Those who slid to the bottom were quickly dispatched by Varicci's 
	marksmen.<br>
	<br>
	Arrows clanged against our shields, the force of them nearly knocking us 
	from our feet. But we pressed on. We climbed.<br>
	<br>
	Eleonora worked her way to the front of the group. The knights tried to 
	force her to the rear, but she would not have it. She was determined to be 
	the first one atop the valley wall.<br>
	<br>
	And so she was. Varicci's knights tried to cut her down as she crested the 
	wall, but she dropped her shield and let forth a fierce volley of fire that 
	melted the knights in their armor. This blast gave our men time to scramble 
	to their feet and being their attack in force.</small></font></font></p>
	<p align="left">
	<align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We lost twenty soldiers on the 
	climb up the valley wall. By the time the battle was over, we lost twenty 
	more. But despite our losses, we managed to slay all eighty of Varicci's 
	men.<br>
	<br>
	Except, of course, for Sir Binwas Loc. He was the prize of the day, and it 
	was Eleonora who took him. The knights of our company all knew the story of 
	Eleonora's victory over Prince Renlen at Lord Marden's tournament. But 
	hearing stories and seeing them in action are two very different 
	experiences.<br>
	<br>
	She fought like a Frenzy. She cut down ten men on her way to Sir Loc. And 
	when she reached him, she dealt not one blow to the man; she merely parried 
	his attacks, waiting for his strength to leave him. She understood his value 
	to our cause. She was not about to see him die when he could prove so much 
	more useful to us as a captive.<br>
	<br>
	With the rest of Loc's force dead, we gathered around and watched the duel. 
	Sir Loc fought bravely. He knew that should he slay Eleonora, the rest of us 
	would finish him off. But still he fought. It was only when his strength 
	left him and he was unable to stand did he finally surrender.<br>
	<br>
	When the knight fell to his knees, Eleonora planted her foot on his chest 
	and shoved him to the ground. She kicked his blade to the side and brought 
	her own sword within inches of his face.<br>
	<br>
	He spat up at her. &quot;Kingslayer wency,&quot; he growled.<br>
	<br>
	&quot;No,&quot; she reminded him. &quot;Renlen was but a prince. But I will earn that title 
	soon enough.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	She motioned to us. &quot;Bind him,&quot; she said. And we did. We bound his hands and 
	feet. We constructed a sling and placed him upon it. Then we dragged our 
	great captive to the Fiun outpost.<br>
	<br>
	The capture of Sir Loc was a marvelous victory. But despite that victory, I 
	cannot forget the faces of all those dead. OVer one hundred men, and for 
	what? What is this was really about? On Ispar, it was a was for the future 
	of the kingdom. But here? There is no kingdom here. There is only us. And, 
	surely, these lands are large enough for us all. Aren't they? Surely Varicci 
	can let old injuries lie.<br>
	<br>
	But no, he cannot. And I suppose that were I in his place, neither could I. 
	He has vowed vengeance, as any sane man would have done.<br>
	<br>
	I just hope some of us are still alive when he gets it.</font></p>
