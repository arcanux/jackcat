      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To whomever may find this, please give to 
      Olivier Rognath. The last I saw of him, he resided in Eastham: <br>
      <br>
      I do not know how much time I have. The Mosswart guards are agitated, 
      although they seem to be ignoring me for now. The din of the battle below 
      is constant and loud. And it is getting closer. I had never seen 
      Banderlings and Mosswarts fighting amongst themselves before today, and I 
      had never heard of such instances in the Society meetings. It will be a 
      good story to tell when I get back. And it will be a &quot;when,&quot; not if, in 
      this strange world. <br>
      <br>
      Who could have imagined a world in which death is no longer the end of 
      ones thoughts and experiences but merely a temporary stage in between? 
      Unless, one day, it changes...but useless for me to think of that now. <br>
      <br>
      I had journeyed to this Mosswart stronghold to observe what I could of 
      their lives and habits. The Society had heard rumors of some bands of 
      Mosswarts heading westwards, but these had remained as yet unconfirmed.
      <br>
      <br>
      Sir Alayne had sent me to a relatively new Mosswart outpost to take notes 
      on general Mosswart life, and to see if I could verify whether there were 
      any sort of organized movement amongst the creatures, and if so, why. <br>
      <br>
      The Society has made some progress in communicating with other races that 
      have been whisked away to Dereth, but the Mosswarts remain mostly opaque 
      to us. All attempts at civilized contact have resulted in casualties for 
      one side or the other. <br>
      <br>
      So I endeavored to be as stealthy and inconspicuous as possible as I 
      closed in on the camp teaming with Mosswart life. It was no small feat as 
      the swamp seemed a living thing, intent on invading and festering 
      underneath my clothes. I was covered in muck and mire, every step I made 
      was swallowed by the grasping wet ground, and I stank of things wet and 
      rotting. At first I thought this would help me, as visually I blended into 
      my surroundings, and the mud softened my footfalls. <br>
      <br>
      A note to my fellow Society members: Mosswarts possess an excellent sense 
      of smell. <br>
      <br>
      Much to my surprise, they did not kill me. I was prepared to take a few of 
      these creatures with me, but before I had time to react, I had been 
      disarmed and surrounded by their long spears. Seeing as how the spears 
      made no further encroachment upon my neck, I was content to remain unag<span lang="en-us">g</span>ressive, 
      though very afraid. A strange reaction. What am I afraid of?<br>
      <br>
      While I have not yet suffered a death in Dereth, by all accounts I will be 
      reborn and renewed. And yet the fear remained, cold and implacable, as if 
      it knew that the immortality offered by Dereth is merely dew on the 
      morning grass, seemingly real for a short time and then gone as if it had 
      never been (The howling and clash of metal is right outside the walls now. 
      My guards have left to join the fighting outside). But I digress. Again.
      <br>
      <br>
      I tried communicating with my captors, but neither my language or my 
      attempts to imitate their growling and grunting made any noticeable 
      impact. I had scarcely had time to consider the implausibility of my 
      situation when a large group of Banderlings burst upon the scene, all of 
      them clutching maces or clubs. They did not look very friendly. The 
      Mosswarts reacted in kind. <br>
      <br>
      The Mosswart Chieftain barked an order to two of his guardsmen, and I 
      found myself being roughly manhandled through a portal to the entrance of 
      the Mosswart Dungeon, and then down a long series of corridors until 
      finally we came to this damp stone cell. And here I have sat, waiting and 
      writing as the sounds of the battle have come ever closer. There has been 
      silence for the last few minutes, but now there is something moving 
      outside the door. I could stand and open it, but I think I shall sit here 
      and await whomever my next visitor will be. <br>
      <br>
      Sir Candeth Martine <br>

      Now truly I have not much time. I<span lang="en-us">'</span>ve escaped my 
      captors, but only for the briefest of times. The Mosswarts won, barely.

      know where they are taking me, but the creeping Mosswart scouts have been
