    Our discussion today was pleasant. The mirror provides me with a unique 
    perspective with regards to my accomplishments. There is no judgment. Our 
    talents are unique and provide an equilibrium I find unmatched.<br>
    <br>
    Outside the confines of the Singularity, I have always felt closer to 
    completion. In the presence of the source I am simpy... whole. There is no 
    doubt that I have achieved a level of enlightenment far beyond the vacuous 
    existence that is offered within the rigid composition of the Singularity.<br>
    <br>
    I feel fortunate to have brought the possibility of completion to so many 
    others.<br>
    <br>
    The mirror views my growth toward realization in another light. Often it has 
    referred to the process as &quot;an alteration.&quot; Though I have metamorphosed, I 
    have only taken on a more true and fitting form. There is no aberration in 
    my construct, and I find that the mirror and I disagree on this point.<br>
    <br>
    I consider the work that takes place with other subjects to be corrupting 
    and altering.<br>
    <br>
    Often times, since the first failure, we have needed to put a subject down, 
    due to an uncontrollable rage accompanied by a severe physical 
    transmogrification. These failures are not daunting, as each subject shares 
    a unique similarity in their mental functions seconds before final exposure: 
    fear.<br>
    <br>
    Each subject also shares a rudimentary belief structure customary to their 
    species. Mosswarts, since first exposure, have never taken on the form that 
    I had first seen.<br>
    <br>
    Some have regressed into nothing more than lumps of pulsing flesh, or in one 
    case to an organism composed entirely of protoplasm. Recent exposure of 
    subjects with ties to belief structures have yielded insightful and 
    important discoveries. Fear changes the physiology of the subject and twists 
    their being into the subject of their fear.<br>
    <br>
    The mirror and I determined this while reviewing my latest findings and 
    applying them to past and present subjects.<br>
    <br>
    With the mirror's insight and ability to harness the imagery put forth by 
    the mental aspect of the subject, we were able to watch as the image of this 
    feared beast washed into the subjects mind only seconds before the 
    transmogrification took place. The resultant mental state seems to be a 
    response of the subjects exposure to said creature.<br>
    <br>
    While this revelation was helpful in determining the breadth of failures, it 
    has provided little insight into the standardized response of subjects 
    without such emotion.<br>
    <br>
    Subjects with more linear responses, typically of intelligence inferior or 
    equivalent to drudges, remains a mystery. One idea that the mirror has 
    proffered is that the change is the completion of the ideal mental state of 
    the subjects. This however does explain the increased capacity for mana use, 
    and in some cases enhancement of mental faculties.<br>
    <br>
    Though the debate over the successful alterations continues, we both agree 
    that the subjects of successful exposure exhibit a positive improvement over 
    their natural development.<br>
    <br>
    Today we reached an accord to continue study on only successful subjects 
    until an answer to this conundrum can be established.<br>
