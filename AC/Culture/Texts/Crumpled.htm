    <p><font color="#ffffff">My dear Alatar!<br>
    <br>
    It's wonderful to hear from you again -- it's been years! I hear stories 
    about your adventures, of course, but that's not the same as a letter. I'm 
    glad to know you're well, and that you haven't lost your sense of humor. The 
    tale of your stay with the undead -- that was hilarious! I was laughing so 
    hard, I had to read it aloud to Borelean; he thought his mother had gone 
    mad!<br>
    <br>
    Oh, and it was kind of you to ask after him -- I know well your feelings 
    about children, but let me assure you that Bor is well past the drooling 
    stage. He is a bright little boy, giggling and serious by turns, but always 
    polite, and so smart. He reminds me always of his father, but he is already 
    his own person and indeed has already left his own mark on our new world, 
    with more to come as he matures, I know. Asheron says -- but no, I'm sorry. 
    I know how you feel about Asheron also, and I don't want our first 
    correspondence in a decade to annoy you. I remember your annoyed face, with 
    your brow beetled and your mouth puckered, and I have no wish to inflict 
    that image on myself any longer.<br>
    <br>
    But you, you rogue, you have annoyed me already with all that talk of 
    &quot;Queen&quot;. I forbid you to call me that, old friend, and if you do it again I 
    shall dispatch Royal Guards to find you! &quot;Is it good to be the Queen?&quot; 
    indeed! And asking if I have used my position to secure romantic engagements 
    -- well, let me just say that I was so incensed by that question that I am 
    considering putting up a monument to you in the middle of Holtburg. Is that 
    threat enough to make you hold your tongue?<br>
    <br>
    Ah, but you know that I am joking with you, Alatar. In truth, there is a 
    certain young man ... but it has not yet gone beyond the 'certain young man' 
    stage. We are friends, we talk, and I do not know if I wish to pursue the 
    matter beyond that, although I rather think he would be willing. We shall 
    see.<br>
    <br>
    As for the rest of it ... let me lapse into seriousness, although I know how 
    you hate that. I do not feel adequate to this task, Alatar. I did not mean 
    to become Queen -- but there were things that needed doing, and no one was 
    doing them, and so I did them. And once I had handled the immediate tasks, 
    there were more, and more, and always more, and suddenly I was not just the 
    person doing -- I was the person in charge of doing. I'm still rather 
    confused as to how that came about, exactly -- but I haven't much time to 
    think of it, because there is still so much more to do.<br>
    <br>
    What saddens me is the attitude -- and I know that it exists, for I have 
    seen it in some eyes -- that I am doing this for my own aggrandizement, or 
    from a sort of power lust or megalomania. That attitude is so foreign to me, 
    as you well know, old friend, that I cannot puzzle it out even a little. How 
    could anyone enjoy this terrible job, this constant worry and politicking, 
    this eternal struggle to meld so many disparate threads into on strong 
    realm? I think perhaps that part of the problem arises because I am most 
    visible when there is some trouble, and thus many come to associate me with 
    troubled times. Goodness knows that we have had our share of flamboyant 
    trouble in the past few years. They do not see our efforts -- not mine 
    alone, of course, but the Council's -- to hold us together, to keep our 
    fragile society alight, and to grow it into a place of peace and plentitude 
    for all. <br>
    <br>
    Take this recent bother with the shopkeepers: more recent arrivals tend to 
    consider themselves residents of Dereth all together, but many of the first 
    arrivals still live wholly in one place and feel their first loyalty is to 
    that town. There is no sin in that, of course, but in this parochialism they 
    have chosen to exclude others. Why, it was all I could do to convince the 
    shopkeepers to no longer charge a tax on trade notes from other towns! You 
    would think I had asked for their firstborn! But eventually, reluctantly, 
    they agreed (although even then they raised their prices to compensate, but 
    I still count it a win overall) and so we are one step closer to a united 
    Dereth and -- dare I say it? -- perhaps one day a banking system such as we 
    knew in Ispar.<br>
    <br>
    But enough of that, old friend -- I have no wish to weary your grizzled old 
    ears with such maundering. Suffice it to say that I am happy in my life, if 
    not always content. I have my son; I have my friends; I have my work; that 
    is enough. But if there were one more thing I could ask ... it would be more 
    letters from old friends! You do not know how your missive cheered my day. 
    You must write again, and soon, and tell me more of your wonderful stories 
    of adventure and exploration. I will send this off now, but I remain:<br>
    <br>
    You friend always,<br>
    Elysa </font></font></td>
