    <p><font face="arial" size="2">This tome appears to be an account of the 
    Moar and its history on Dereth. Unfortunately, the Moarsmen of the Vesayen 
    Islands have ruined the text over the many years. In addition to this, what 
    is contained in this tome only appears to be half of a complete story. As 
    always, the following is the best overview that I can muster give the 
    condition of the original copy. <br>
    <br>
    The Falatacot appear to have brought the Moar to Auberean for observation. 
    After seeing what the small beast was capable of, the Falatacot Priestesses 
    gathered a small collection of them and brought them across the vast divide 
    back to this world. The notes mention that had it not been for the &quot;Dark 
    Sisters&quot; meddling in the magics of Bur, the followers of the Light would 
    never have considered bringing the Moar here. <br>
    <br>
    The Moar were brought here in the hopes that they could be used to help undo 
    the damage done by the &quot;Dark Sisters.&quot; The followers of the Light contained 
    the Moars on the Vesayen Islands, observing them and taming them over time.
    <br>
    <br>
    While this was occurring, the creatures used to make the Sclavus (in 
    combination with the male Falatacot Consorts) began their society on Bur, 
    and were stricken by the malice of the Burun. <br>
    <br>
    At this point, the Dark Sisters abandoned the world of Bur. They took with 
    them a supply of the serpent-like creatures and sealed the access to the 
    world. The Dark Sisters were content to leave the world to doom after they 
    had collected their followers. <br>
    <br>
    This did not sit well with the followers of the Light. It is at this point 
    that they began investigating the injuries the Dark Sisters had wrought upon 
    the world of Bur. <br>
    <br>
    [Translator's Note: It is at this point that the book becomes unreadable. A 
    handful of pages make reference to the Falatacot singing to the Moar and 
    bringing about an evolution upon them, but the text's condition is not 
    legible enough to confirm this.] <br>
