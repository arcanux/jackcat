	I had only just received Sarneho's &quot;Writ of Interdict&quot; that condemned 
	Wardiel the Mighty as a knave and a threat to all, when I heard reports of 
	Wardiel attacking the good people of Dereth outside of Qalaba'r near the 
	Lugian Tower. I traveled there swiftly, using portals to hasten my journey, 
	and arrived to witness the aftermath of a great battle. People lay where 
	they were slain and the smell of death was thick in the air. I asked a 
	survivor to relate what had happened, and in a broken voice, he said that 
	Wardiel and Bael'Zharon had raised altars to invoke chaos and strife. These 
	altars allowed the people of Dereth to attack each other -- and gave Wardiel 
	the opportunity to undertake a great slaughter. My informer told how Wardiel 
	had initially been beaten back by a surprise attack of Derethians -- but had 
	returned swiftly, stinking with Bael'Zharon's evil power. After killing the 
	townsfolk en masse, he finally claimed the town as his own. I shivered, but, 
	my curiosity overcoming my fear, I headed in the direction the citizen 
	indicated Wardiel had gone. <br>
	<br>
	As I went, I discovered that Wardiel had cut his way northwards, at first 
	meeting little resistance. He overcame much if not all of the Sho and 
	Gharu'ndim lands, and those lands that he could not conquer, he set his 
	banderling thralls upon. Most disturbing, however, was the case of Samsur, 
	where the citizens had the temerity to swear fealty to him, actually 
	greeting the knave with open arms! <br>
	<br>
	Despite Samur's treachery, Wardiel's reign of terror lost momentum. Again 
	and again, at Shoushi, Yaraq, Eastham, and Cragstone, the folk of Dereth 
	organized to repel his attacks. The defense suffered a setback at Eastham, 
	when an epic battle between Fheer, a defender of good, and Kudce, a follower 
	of Wardiel, ended in Fheer's momentary defeat. However, Fheer was destined 
	to return . . . <br>
	<br>
	In Holtburg, Wardiel's downfall began. Fheer, recovering from the wounds 
	inflicted on him, led an army complete with healers and enchanters, who both 
	aided him and weakened Wardiel with the spell Imperil VI. The people of 
	Holtburg clashed directly with Wardiel. His train of evil followers, led by 
	Blackthorn, Mortanius, and Kudce, sent many brave Derethians to the 
	lifestones. However, Holtburg did not fall, and eventually Wardiel fled to 
	Glenden Wood with delusions of making it his capital. Of his followers, only 
	Kudce dared follow his failing dream. <br>
	<br>
	It was at Glenden Wood that Wardiel lost his strength, Bael'Zharon's favor, 
	and his life. Bael'Zharon, disgusted with his minion's failures, withdrew 
	his blessing without warning as Wardiel began his assault. Stripped of his 
	supernatural power, Wardiel was slain by the weapons and spells of Dereth's 
	mightiest defenders. Even as Wardiel cast healing spell after healing spell 
	upon himself, the crowd closed in, filled with a bloodlust of their own. <br>
	<br>
	Following his death, adventurers discovered Wardiel's hideout at an old 
	fortress southwest of Rithwic. A number of the defenders have remained, to 
	found a village called Lytelthorpe in the keep's shadow. In the meantime, 
	the towns Wardiel conquered have driven out his banderling troops and begun 
	the slow, painful process of rebuilding. There are rumblings that, in the 
	months to come, a successor will appear, seeking to triumph where Wardiel 
	failed and -- with Bael'Zharon's help -- bring all of Dereth to its knees.
