    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">~ The Silfi of the Crimson 
    Stars: Volume I ~<br>
    <br>
    a History by<br>
    Kayna bint Iswas of the Walim </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">In the southern
    skies of old Ispar may be seen a picturesque cluster of five red stars, all bound together
    and encircled by streamers and whorls of luminous mist. They are judged by the astrologers
    of the al-Ighaz to be much larger than the norm of stars. Indeed, this is obvious to the
    most untrained eye, as their hue and brightness is much greater than that of the stars
    around them. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">In the Aluvian lands, where they rise above the horizon only
    during the summer months, the cluster is unimaginatively called the Apple-Cart. The Sho
    Empire, whose sky they grace year-round, prettily titles them &quot;The Watchfires at the
    Southern Gates of Heaven.&quot; The night the cluster touches the sacred peak of Akisuma,
    as seen from the Imperial City, is traditionally held to be the start of their Festival of
    Lights. Our own people, who also enjoy the cluster's presence year-round, simply call them
    the Crimson Stars. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Our people have named the five stars of the cluster as
    follows; al-Shajar, al-Khur, Mahwan, Yujazik, and Sulmada. These names are ancient, but
    for that of al-Khur, which shines the brightest blood-red of them all. This star, once
    called al-Ghul, was renamed in honor of Rakhil al-Khur some three hundred years ago, after
    the great victory won at the salt mines to the east of Tirethas. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">There are many strange tales told of the Crimson Stars. Some
    say that they speak to nomads in the desert, others that they guide the destinies of the
    mighty. Under the clear skies of the Naqut, more than one weary traveler has claimed to
    see them pulse or wander the sky, or felt that the five vermilion orbs were staring
    oppressively down upon them. The warlord al-Khur, when deep in his cups, claimed to have
    seen the stars flash in the heavens when he was a boy. He said the sand around him had
    been washed a bloody crimson, and the grains moving in the wind seemed to him as moving
    armies. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">All such tales are assumed to be fables, of course. Al-Khur
    was notorious for the amount of drink he consumed at victory celebrations. No other
    reliable witnesses have ever reported these phenomena - only the nomads, who have their
    own name for the cluster; &quot;The Silent Watchers.&quot; Nevertheless, the Crimson Stars
    have indeed had a meaningful hand in the history of the Gharu'ndim people, on more than
    one occasion. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">In the period of our history known as the Century of Storms,
    no fewer than twenty-five different would-be Maliks and Malikas ruled the Gharu'ndim
    people. One of these was the Malika Ladriya bint Daum, of the Taban region. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Ladriya was an exception among her contemporaries. A woman of
    peace and learning, she had been educated by the al-Ighaz at Tirethas. Indeed, she had
    spent most of her life in the City of Lore, only rarely being sent by her father to visit
    her ancestral homeland. She was a master of the life magics of Ispar, and had achieved
    much prestige as a healer. Before the death of the great Amul ibn Rakhil, her father had
    been a minor Mu'allim in the court; her mother had died in childbirth. While some tongues
    had connected her romantically with her captain, the great Faris Tamsah ibn Jaidah, she
    remained unmarried during her brief, brilliant life.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">After some fifteen years of chaos, the former court of Amul
    ibn Rakhil at al-Nafalt had already begun to dwindle from the shadowy competition for the
    throne. Ladriya, then twenty-six and disgusted by the situation, decided to return to her
    homeland for good. It was a decision she later admitted having deferred since being
    orphaned at her father's death, ten years before. Having known the City of Lore for most
    her life, it seemed more of a home than far-off Taban, on the far side of the great Naqut
    Desert. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Halfway through her journeying, the caravan was attacked at
    night by a band of nomads, sent by the renegade Shayk Ridqidh. Ladriya had been asleep
    when the raiders came, and awoke to find herself sprawled upon the sands, the Crimson
    Stars floating placidly above the dunes. By the light of the burning wagons, she could see
    most of her guard lying dead, and the rest suffering unspeakable torments at the hands of
    the nomads. She scrambled to her feet and made to flee, only to be brought up short by
    several armed bandits. These filth made to ravish her, and one slashed away the sleeve of
    her traveling robes, causing her a grievous injury in the process. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As Ladriya cried in pain, Tamsah, riding his magnificent
    black stallion Talayyin, burst through her attackers. Leaning off the stallion's flank, he
    seized her while at full gallop, pulling her across the saddle and leaving the nomads to
    curse in the dust. Only the most skilled of horsemen could have performed such a feat. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, while Ladriya could have easily healed herself
    using the arts of the al-Ighaz, her staff and supplies had been lost in the raid. Tamsah
    bound her wound as best he could, and lashed her to Talayyin's saddle. He himself led the
    stallion by the bridle through the wasteland. With little food or water, he hoped to get
    his Lady to the oasis of Shiryaz, three days away at a hard ride, before she perished. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As they journeyed through the desert, moving mostly in the
    cool of the night, the young Mu'allima had a vision. While she herself later dismissed it
    as a trick of heat, dehydration, and pain, it clearly had a profound effect on the course
    of her life. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Feverishly looking over Talayyin's neck at sunset on the
    fourth day, she saw the sun as a vessel filled with blood. A bead formed on its lower rim.
    This grew, trembled, and fell. Where it hit the sand, the land changed. One after the
    other, one hundred drops in all, she watched the blood spill upon the sands, turning the
    land into a wasteland of slaughter. Ladriya saw villages and fields burnt to ash, the
    bodies of men, women, and children swarming with flies, and cities reduced to piles of
    rubble, visited only by the restless sands of the Naqut. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Then, Ladriya did see a great storm come out of the north,
    from the sea. The thunder growled like a hungry predator sensing weak prey. A great grey
    storm-wave rolled in from the sea, and smashed against tall cliffs, eating the base of
    them away. There was a city above the cliffs, from whose minarets flew the banners of the
    Malik. It trembled as the ground beneath it was carved away. Finally, it fell in upon
    itself. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Finally, she saw one last thing, and this was she herself,
    sitting alone on the throne of the Malik. The royal consort's chair, to her right, sat
    empty. In the sky above her pulsed the familiar constellation of the Crimson Stars, and
    their red light seemed to glow within her own dark eyes. She held her left hand up, and
    the storm-waves recoiled, then slunk back to the northeast, whence they had come. She
    cupped her right hand beneath the bleeding sun, and caught all but seventeen of the drops.
    </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Tamsah then noticed Ladriya holding out her hand, appearing
    to cup the setting sun's last light. He grasped her hand, and his touch wiped away the
    vision. There again was only the fading light of the sunset, the rolling dunes, the
    whisper of the sands in the twilight wind, and the Crimson Stars, watching her progress
    impassively. She later wrote that Tamsah, rubbing her cold hand between both of his, gave
    her a look so tender that, in the wake of her vision, she began to weep. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The two survivors reached Shiryaz two nights later. Ladriya
    was by then nearly dead from her wound, and Tamsah was starved and parched. He had given
    his Lady all but the barest water he needed to function. A skilled life mage was able to
    mend Ladriya's gash, but it took her almost two months to recover her strength from the
    ordeal. Throughout that period, Tamsah stayed by her side day and night. They returned in
    triumph to the court of Taban, at Nishadina, on the 6th of Solclaim, 1018. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Taban is a mountainous region, not unlike the area around
    Zaikhal in the land of Dereth. The province produced enough food to feed itself, and was
    chiefly known for its olive groves. Perhaps more critical for its survival were the jewels
    that could be mined in the mountains, which fetched excellent prices in markets as far
    away as Silveran. Ladriya's palace at Nishadina was modestly sized by the standards of the
    day, but considered quite elegant. Since the death of her father, her family's viziers had
    administrated the province. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As befits a ruler returning after long absence, the guilds
    and merchants of Taban were soon lined at the gates of her palace, burdened with gifts.
    Among these were a set of five magnificent rubies, found in the deepest mines of the
    Nariyid Range; the high mountains that towered over Nishadina. The merchant Nurbi ibn
    Nuhqidh had sent these. Accepting them with grace, she had them sent directly to her
    chambers.As befits a ruler returning after long absence, the guilds and merchants of Taban

    <p><small><font face="Arial">Ladriya spent her first month home learning all she could
    about her ancestral homeland. The viziers looked down their noses at the &quot;spoiled
    city-dweller,&quot; but patiently explained all they could of the province. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">One warm summer morning, she stood upon one of her balconies,
    and looked out over the olive groves to the north. On the horizon could be seen the pale
    edge of the Naqut, the sky above dulled with sand roused by a windstorm. Behind her, she
    knew, the changeless peaks of the Nariyid pierced the thin clouds. Around her, below the
    minarets of her palace, were throngs of citizens going about their lives, undisturbed by
    the chaos in the City of Lore. She stood and thoughtfully sipped a cup of spiced tea,
    breathing in the smell of the land and the people, until the day had lost the blush of its
    youth. Then, turning briskly, she called for her courtiers to summon three souls. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As they were fetched, Ladriya had the court cleared. First to
    arrive was Tamsah ibn Jaidah. His long black hair was tied back, as he had been in the
    middle of training. He made to question her summons, but she motioned for him to be
    silent. Next to arrive was Raya al-Darikil, smelling of the spices and perfumes of
    Nishadina's marketplace. She was known as the finest smith in the province, and was
    smudged with soot from the forge. Last to arrive was Jumiz ibn Ismak, who was one of
    Ladriya's viziers. He frowned at the sight of the other two, and brushed down his long
    robe of Sho silk. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">To Tamsah, the Malika put forth the question; &quot;What
    weapon would you have to lead your Farisim to victory?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">To this, he replied, &quot;A silifi, my lady.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Nodding, she turned to Raya. &quot;Would you be of a mind to
    drop all your other business, and forge for this man a great silifi? For this, I would
    well reward you.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Glancing from Ladriya to Tamsah, Raya replied, &quot;It would
    be my honor to do so, Mu'allima.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Ladriya nodded again, as if she had expected no less. At
    last, her gaze settled on Jumiz. &quot;You, Vizier, have much knowledge of the enchanter's
    art. Though you do not speak of it yourself, I know of this from the talk in Tirethas.
    Once, you were a most promising apprentice. Yet, upon the death of Amul ibn Rakhil, praise
    be his name, you begged my father to return to Nishadina. You said, I believe, that there
    would be no Malik worth serving upon achieving your mastery. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I do not wish to be Malika, yet I must be. I make this
    decision not out of desire for power, riches, or glory, but because this land must be at
    peace once more, and these people united. No more blood must be spilled. I ask you now,
    Jumiz; would you help me?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Jumiz licked his lips nervously, and looked at the floor of
    the hall. &quot;Mu'allima, you ask a difficult thing of me. As al-Ighaz, I am sworn to the
    service of peace.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I, also, am al-Ighaz,&quot; Ladriya said, softly.
    &quot;I have studied in the same halls as you, Jumiz, and heard the words of Mu'hij ibn
    Zarif, who teaches his apprentices the Sho virtues of the Four Stones of Jojii. As a
    child, running through the halls of the Arcanum at Tirethas, I often saw you deep in your
    studies.&quot; With a small, reserved smile, she added, &quot;I believe I once stained
    your robes with the juice of a peach.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The Vizier bowed slightly, amazed at her candor. &quot;This
    is all true, my lady. If you are sincere in your desire to remain true to the teachings of
    the Arcanum, I would assist you in any way you ask. But, I must wonder, for the others in
    this chamber are a warrior and a maker of weapons. You speak of forging a silifi, for the
    Faris ibn Jaidah to lead your troops to victory. I pray you may forgive my temerity, but I
    do not see how this endeavor matches the beauty of your words.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Ladriya nodded, sorrowfully. &quot;This is true, my Vizier.
    But I have spent the last fifteen years in Tirethas, watching your prophesy to my father
    become cold truth. The court at al-Nafalt is a den of thieves, all looking to murder one
    another for the throne. A woman from the far side of the desert, speaking words of peace
    and unity, would be laughed at. Then, she would be done away with. The glorious peace of
    ibn Rakhil died with him.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I would defend you with my life, Mu'allima,&quot;
    Tamsah said, quietly. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Favoring him with another tiny smile, Ladriya said, &quot;I
    would rather you defend me with a fine weapon, my Faris. A weapon, no matter how precious,
    may be replaced.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You wish me to forge this weapon,&quot; Raya said,
    boldly. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I do, master smith,&quot; Ladriya said. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;And,&quot; Jumiz said, wearily, &quot;you desire that I
    enchant it.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Not quite, wise vizier. I desire that you enchant
    these.&quot; At this, Ladriya took a small, elaborately carved sandalwood box from the arm
    of her throne, and opened it. She motioned the others forward. There, on a bed of rich red
    velvet, lay the five gift rubies of Nurbi ibn Nuhqidh. Jumiz raised a brow, and Raya
    gasped at their beauty. Only Tamsah, who regarded them with a soldier's eye, remained
    unmoved. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I have named these rubies the Crimson Stars,&quot;
    Ladriya said, sounding most distant as she spoke. &quot;Each is named for one of those in
    the cluster, which the nomads revere and fear in equal measure. It is my wish that you
    should enchant them as follows. Al-Shajar, named for the storm-demon in the old stories,
    should allow he who carries it to feel not the pains of lightning. The ruby al-Khur, which
    is named for the warlord known as the Eagle, should cause the blade to cut to the quick. .
    Yujazik, named for the flaming mountain the court of the old gods was built upon, should
    protect the bearer from the pains of fire. Mahwan, which is named for the citadel upon
    Yujazik, should enable its bearer to parry more blows. Sulmada, named for the old god of
    dance, should increase the agility of he who wields it.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Those are mostly defensive spells, my lady,&quot;
    Tamsah said, sounding dubious. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Ladriya, who stared fixedly at
    Jumiz. &quot;So they are.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">At this, the vizier smiled, though it was humorless.
    &quot;And you desire that these jewels, once enchanted, be fitted into the haft of the
    silifi?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I do.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;This, then, is to be a weapon used in
    self-defense?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Only,&quot; Ladriya nodded, &quot;for the protection of
    its bearer and his charge.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I see.&quot; Jumiz steepled his hands before him, and
    frowned. Raya shifted, as if about to ask a question, but Tamsah laid a stilling hand upon
    her arm. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">At last, the vizier looked back to Ladriya. When he did so,
    he seemed to have gained in years. &quot;I will do all you ask,&quot; he said, simply. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Ladriya looked upon him with gratitude, and sympathy. The
    three were dismissed to their tasks. </font></small></td>
