    We have just finished our final translation, but it is not the end of the 
	book. Torgluuk has become aware of us. He was waiting when we returned the 
	book this day. There was an unspoken threat in the way he stood before us. 
	Without the ability to harm him, we thought we would be better served to not 
	press the issue. He said if we wish to know what is written within the 
	remainder of the book all we need do is ask.<br>
	<br>
	Ikakhe</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Translation<br>
	<br>
	After the defeat of the Fiazhat there is a short time of peace. But castes 
	develop and the smaller Burun are pressed into indentured servitude.<br>
	<br>
	The three castes are referred to as Kukuur, Guruk and Ruuk.<br>
	<br>
	Kukuur are the ruling caste, bloated by powerful magic gifted to them by The 
	Sleeping One, they are the leaders of the clutches and maintain tight 
	control over the small minded Guruk.<br>
	<br>
	Guruk are the sturdiest warriors of the Burun and are possessed of terribly 
	small intellect. During the ensuing years they become cannibalistic, 
	consuming the Ruuk.<br>
	<br>
	Ruuk watching their brethren become meals to their larger cousins begin to 
	speak of revolt.<br>
	<br>
	The revolt is short-lived and bloody. Both sides suffer many casualties and 
	one of the eldest Kukuur is killed. In the end, cannibalism is outlawed and 
	many of the Ruuk are sent to form clutches at the places where the Fizhat's 
	false gods first made their appearances.<br>
	<br>
	Browerk issues the prophecy of Revenge: The prophecy spells out a vision 
	that the mucor granted of The Sleeping One opening his eye after a time of 
	great sadness and allowing the Burun to visit death and humiliation upon the 
	Fiazhat's gods. This proclamation instills the strength of the hierarchy and 
	reinforces belief in the Kukuur as the true leaders of the Burun.<br>
	<br>
	Small pockets of Fiazhat are discovered still living in burning lands across 
	Bur. Hunter packs are created that find their way across the surface 
	eradicating any areas of the Fiazhat as they go. Within five hundred cycles 
	there are no remnants of the Fiazhat race left on Bur.<br>
	<br>
	A time of peace reigns for another five hundred years. After nearly thirty 
	three thousand cycles Browerk, the leader of all Burun, gestates his single 
	egg. The birth is portentous and his offspring Tkrowerk is expected to take 
	his place after Browerk's death.<br>
	<br>
	Tkrowerk is too forward thinking and violates the edicts to not feed mucor 
	to the Ruuk. The small pocket of Ruuk who are fed the mucor are sent to 
	Tkoruk Guruul and Tkrowerk is put to death by his father. After his death, 
	The Sleeping One's eye closes and the rains begin anew.<br>
	<br>
	Bur is now covered entirely by swamp.<br>
	<br>
	Sixty cycles after Tkorwerk's death the moar make their way from beneath the 
	world as one. They begin to lay waste to remote outposts of Burun populated 
	solely by Ruuk. Word reaches the six clutch masters and they send no help. 
	Moar devastate several more outposts and still no response.<br>
	<br>
	For thirty more cycles there is no response until the Kukuur are threatened. 
	They enact a great rite and try to eradicate the moar as one. They fail and 
	are shaken. They retreat to the safety of the Great Swamps and the temples 
	that they have built to The Sleeping One. Ruuk are left to fend across the 
	entirety of Bur.<br>
	<br>
	The mucor is blind to the moar as they rampage across the world. They have 
	changed even more while in the underworld and cannot be seen by the fungus.<br>
	<br>
	Battles go poorly and several crops of young are lost to the encroaching 
	moar, after one hundred and twelve cycles of fighting, a tunnel at Tkoruk 
	Guruul blasts to life.<br>
