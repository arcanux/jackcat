      bint Zayi the Translator tells you, &quot;It would seem they do not all
      get along. Old grudges, I suppose.&quot;</font></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I write you, sister, from
      the camp of the Latzimestal. A bestial place it is, by our standards.
      These warlords have never approached the majesty of His Eternal
      Splendor’s court, but choosing to assemble on this stinking island is
      the depth of indecorum. The insects swarm about us in numbers I have never
      before seen! I have been casting Cassius’ Ring since I arrived, and
      still more rise from the pool of stagnant water. Anadil insists that here,
      we shall be safe from the barbarians. I think he places too much stock in
      the offshore currents.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I would not have guessed,
      when I left my lair, that the Latzimestal still had such strength as this
      hidden away. Their warriors, remnants of the household soldiery they fled
      Dericost with, had been hidden in the sands of Diastra. The years of
      repose did not go well with them, I fear; but for the ageless Mu-Miyah,
      most are reduced to bone and scraps of flesh. Again we prove that an alert
      mind is the best way to preserve the body.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tonight the was an
      incident. Rytheran and Aerfalle had come to confer with Anadil. They
      brought with them Asmolum the Worm, one time spymaster to Lord Inekkere.
      Anadil and his captains listened to his report without comment, and
      afterwards asked several surprisingly shrewd questions. He is not the
      barbarian herd-master I expected. Indeed he is a general, of sound mind.
      He will not, I think, equal old Nerash, but he will serve.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At any rate, he treated us
      to a reception afterwards, in a tent brightly lit with emerald mage-fires.
      Elleina chastised him for the display, noting that it was poor enough a
      plan to assemble such a large force in the open, but that setting fires as
      well was begging for the notice of the Enemy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;If one has a
      sword,&quot; Anadil replied, &quot;one draws and uses it. One does not
      hide in shadows, and wait to stab his enemy while he is helpless. That is
      cowardly. Power should ever be exercised in honest fashion. Here we are
      mighty, and may withstand all but the fiercest assault by the Enemy.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Again,&quot; said
      Ellenia dismissively, &quot;we see displayed the casual arrogance of the
      Latzimestal, so rapt with their own power. No doubt you will find yourself
      disgraced again on the field of battle. How smug were you, dog, watching
      our enemies throw themselves at your lines, while your king was killed
      behind your back?&quot;&nbsp; </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At this, Anadil leapt
      nimbly to his feet, and in two strides crossed the room and backhanded
      Ellenia! In an instant, Aerfalle and I reached the two. Aerfalle seized
      Anadil, although he did not seem inclined to do more, and stared Ellenia
      down. I held her, and felt her quiver with rage. She loosed a stream of
      vile invective, calling the general a base mercenary, an arrogant thug,
      and other less-repeatable things.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;And you, great
      lady?&quot; Anadil retorted. &quot;You who bathed in the entrails of a
      loving husband to feed your lust for eternal life and power? Are you such
      an upstanding example of behavior then, scheming witch? For thousands of
      years we have heard tales of your callous and vicious nature, of your
      relentless devouring of every lord that caught your fancy.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;This bickering,&quot;
      the Worm said quietly, &quot;benefits only the forces of the
      Servant.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Asmolum speaks
      truth,&quot; Aerfalle declared, not slackening the weight of her glare at
      Ellenia. The moot broke up shortly thereafter, with neither party having
      apologized or forgiven the other.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ellenia said to me
      afterwards, &quot;Have I really such a reputation for being...&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Tempestuous?&quot; I
      suggested, with some delicacy.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Indeed,&quot; she
      said, and smiled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Lady Elleina, so thou
      hast always been. But that is part and parcel of thy undeniable charm.
      Thou art strong, and that is a virtue that is much to be admired.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;You do me honor with
      the high tongue. Why, I wonder?&quot; She smiled again, and walked
      gracefully away into the twilight. I think, after five hundred years of
      trying to get her attention, she has finally noticed my interest. There is
      another benefit to eternity, I suppose; eventually, you may be the last
      suitor left standing.</font></td>
