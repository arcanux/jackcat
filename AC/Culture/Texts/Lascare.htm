    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	I've had enough of this foul and evil bull! I thought of taking care of some 
	weird-looking red bull would be a nice retirement after all those years 
	working in the slaughterhouse. Little did I know that the job would keep my 
	hands bloodier and my dreams more twisted than even that one occasion when I 
	worked at the sausage festival among the barbaric Aluvians!<br>
	<br>
	I certainly regret taking this job. Back in the early days of the 
	settlement, it seemed like the King and the Grand Knight were battling 
	traitors and rebels and deserters at every turn, and anyone who wanted to 
	stay safely behind the walls of Sanamar had to prove themselves to be useful 
	and loyal. So when the man in green came to me and told me the secret of the 
	bull that the Prince and Grand Knight were so superstitious about... Well, 
	it seemed like the best option that an old soldier had, when he couldn't 
	work as a quartermaster for an army that had no lands to conquer.<br>
	<br>
	So here's the big secret, just so I can have a printed reminder of why I 
	will never return to Sanamar: The great Red Bull of Sanamar is so hearty and 
	red because the horrible thing eats hearts. Specifically, the hearts of 
	tortured, screaming, human-like things that the man in green called &quot;Fiun.&quot; 
	Believe me, I have tried all sorts of different substitutes. Chicken hearts, 
	beef hearts, even those pulsing lumps from the shadowy man-things... if it 
	once pulsed, I tried to feed it to that bull. And nothing works except for 
	the hearts of the m<span lang="en-us">os</span>t twisted of these Fiun, 
	which reside in the darkest reaches of a pit that the man in green called 
	the &quot;Cannibal Caverns.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	I should have just run screaming from Sanamar when the man in green told me 
	about the bull's vicious secret. In fact, now that I've had some time to 
	think about it, how the hell did he know what he knows about the bull? I was 
	too happy about e<span lang="en-us">s</span>caping exile or the torture 
	chambers to really question him. But how did he know such specific things? 
	He even knew to go to the deepest parts of the dungeons. He was right that 
	the screaming wretches in the upper levels wouldn't have hearts suitable for 
	that cursed bull.<br>
	<br>
	I am starting to suspect that the man in green has some hand in the bull's 
	peculiar diet. I only wish I had searched those caverns a little better<span lang="en-us">.</span></font></p>
