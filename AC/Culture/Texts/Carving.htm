    That Which Is Ours</a> event.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    In the beginning, we transplanted Isparians who had some knowledge of locks 
    and keys were perhaps not considered the most valuable members of the 
    community. Some, in fact, even cast aspirations on our pasts and suggested 
    that the main use of a facility with locks was to open doors better left 
    shut. But as time went on, more and more uses for our particular talents 
    were found. I've compiled a short list of those new uses here, both as a 
    guide for the aspiring locksmith and as a proof of our worth to any in the 
    community who might doubt it.<br>
    <br>
    The first thing you will need is a good tool. Although lockpicks are the 
    traditional tool for our work, you'll need something sturdier for carving 
    keys and keyrings. I recommend purchasing an Intricate Carving Tool from the 
    fine person who sold you this guide. <br>
    <br>
    Once you have a tool, there are two directions in which your carving might 
    take you. First, we have found a number of inoperative or damaged keys which 
    can repaired by those with enough skill at locksmithing. These include the 
    Virindi Master Key, the Virindi Directive Key, and the Virindi Singularity 
    Key, all of which can be found on various Virindi and their minions. These 
    keys are not usable by humans in their native form, but can be carved with 
    an Intricate Carving Tool and then used to unlock Virindi Troves. Similarly, 
    certain damaged keys, such as the Twisted Dark Key and the Mangled Dark Key 
    can be repaired to become Marble Keys and Granite Keys respectively, and 
    these can then be used to open large caches of treasure.<br>
    <br>
    Be careful, however - if your lockpicking skill is not sufficient, you are 
    likely to destroy the key entirely. I have listed the preceding keys in 
    order from least difficult to most difficult, so keep that in mind.<br>
    <br>
    The second path you may follow in your carving involves creating keys and 
    keyrings from existing natural objects. Through constant experimentation, we 
    have learned that many golem hearts are able to be carved into keys and 
    keyrings quite effectively. An interesting look at how some of this 
    knowledge was obtained can be found in the manual &quot;Mnemosynes and the Art of 
    Lockpicking&quot; by Vinchlane Dranal. Rather than provide a journal of 
    discovery, however, I will merely list the carving interactions that we know 
    today.<br>
    <br>
    Wood Golem Hearts can be carved into Intricate Wooden Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Copper Golem Hearts can be carved into Intricate Copper Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Iron Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Master Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Obsidian Golem Hearts can be carved into Intricate Obsidian Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Granite Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Sturdy Iron Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Glacial Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Directive Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Diamond Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Singularity Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Pyreal Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Marble Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Platinum Golem Hearts can be carved into keyrings that hold Granite Keys.<br>
    <br>
    Again, if your lockpicking skill is not sufficient to the task, you risk 
    destroying the golem heart without creating any keys or keyrings. <br>
    <br>
    Once you have carved a key or keyring, anyone can use it. Indeed, this is 
    the true value we bring to the community. With our skills, we create 
    opportunities for everyone. To add a key to the ring, use the ring on the 
    key. The ring will only accept the proper type of keys. Unfortunately, 
    adding keys to a keyring weakens its structure, so the lifetime of the 
    keyring is limited by how many keys you have added. <br>
    <br>
    Removing a key, however, does not weaken the keyring. Use your Intricate 
    Carving Tool to remove a key from the keyring. <br>
    <br>
    At this time, these two activities - repairing damaged or inoperable keys 
    and creating new keys and keyrings from golem hearts - are the mainstay of 
    the locksmithing work on Dereth. Don't be fooled, however, into thinking 
    that these are trivial tasks. Many of them are quite difficult, and without 
    these activities the general commerce of Dereth would grind to a halt. </font></td>
