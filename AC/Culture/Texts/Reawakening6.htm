    <a href="../Dereth/Waking2.htm">Waking 
    From the Abyss</a> event (Dec. 22, 2003).<br>
&nbsp;</font></span><div class="bodyTextMedium">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">The Consul, Kaedrix, stretched its mind 
      outward and brought swinging scythes along the coarse black stone that 
      served as the connecting tunnel from the most complex of Aerbax’s 
      laboratories. Ahead of him he heard the unholy screams of the latest 
      creations and felt the air grow chill. Kaedrix was freed nearly 9 months 
      prior and during that time had served as an intermediary between Lord 
      Aerbax and the “watchers” on the Singularity Caul.</font><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Since Aerbax had released the first of his 
      maddened creations upon the surface world, they had gathered within the 
      crux of a valley that occupied territory north of the Obsidian Plains. 
      There, in the valley, Aerbax had uncovered an area of analogous natural 
      beings. The Banderlings had proven to be the most plentiful and volatile 
      of the current inhabitants. They had taken the residency of Aerbax’s 
      creations as signs of an invasion. Dereth was too abuzz with news that the 
      Olthoi Matriarch had tunneled from other rock formations to care about the 
      burgeoning battles within the valley, thus Aerbax’s creations were able to 
      breed and lay waste to a great majority of the natural creatures that had 
      migrated to the area. The Isparians made battle within the valley in great 
      numbers, but they failed to see the depth of the battles that were fought 
      there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The connections between the several 
      entities that made their way to the valley were nebulous. Each species had 
      their own desires, and each had their own goals and machinations. The 
      undead had arrived soon after the first of Aerbax’s experiments had 
      crested the surface. Then a unified coalition of Tumerok and Lugians 
      arrived, followed by Virindi still subjugated by the Quiddity. Aerbax had 
      come to the valley in an effort to evade the growing Virindi presence, 
      only to find that they would not rest until he and his free-willed cohorts 
      were re-harvested and re-integrated into the collective. A battle raged 
      that spilled raw mana into the valley and brought about more fearsome 
      creations of magical energy. After nine months of tumult, six months of 
      Isparian ignorance, and twelve months of watching the facilities on the 
      Singularity Caul Kaedrix found himself at a loss: Aerbax was not visible 
      to the Auditor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fear, being a new emotion, gripped Kaedrix 
      and spurred him into making this trip to the last known facility that 
      Aerbax and his “echo” had inhabited. As he made his way through the grim 
      obsidian halls, a red haze began to flood the air and the sounds of pain 
      coupling with torment and ecstasy washed over him like the energy arcs 
      within the Singularity. Exhilaration, also a new emotion, brought him to 
      dig the scythes deeper into the stonework about him. He stopped and 
      allowed the wave of pleasure to subside before continuing forward.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A grouping of energy bars fizzled as he 
      approached and a mechanism clicked behind the wall. Beyond the door lay a 
      large room, complete with cages of arcing black energy surrounding test 
      subjects, cold stone slabs where the altered meat of the beings could be 
      better examined, and the “echo.” Aerbax was nowhere to be seen. The 
      “echo,” flanked by two Paradox -- a puppet and a master combined, and then 
      enhanced by exposure to the “energy source”—stood as guards to the “echo.”
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Brother Kaedrix, your arrival brings 
      us euphoria. </i></b>The “echo” had learned to communicate as they did. It 
      unnerved Kaedrix slightly as the creature bowed its head and managed a 
      faint smile. Transparent beings such as this were difficult to discern, 
      they had no substance and could not be tested as the meat-based creatures. 
      Several experiments with exposure to energy of the Quiddity had resulted 
      in madness in the lesser beings like it, but the “echo” was different. The 
      “echo” was resistant and possessed a mentality that was both cunning and 
      depraved.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>You have arrived at the end of our 
      latest session with this subject. It has proven to be a rarity amongst its 
      kind. Would you care to inspect the subject and my findings? </i></b>the 
      “echo” asked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>I have come to converse with Lord 
      Aerbax. His presence is absent from our inquiries. Do you know of his 
      whereabouts? </i></b>Kaedrix retorted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An arc of black lightning coruscated over 
      the smallish creature causing it to yelp then grow to an aberrant size. 
      The process was instant, painful and too much for the small frame of the 
      creature to handle. Blood oozed from its eyes and mouth and its little 
      snout twitched uncontrollably, still alive but incoherent and likely 
      destroyed. The “echo” shook its head and tendrils of black smoke wisped 
      off of its crown, re-forming into smaller versions of itself upon the 
      ground. The little ones drifted to the floor and ran into the dark 
      crevices within the lightless room.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Lord Aerbax has been called, as my 
      master before.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Meaning?</i></b> Kaebrix asked, 
      impatient.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>His presence on this world is masked 
      from the sight of those far less than he. I am his mirror no more. Though 
      he will still call me so, I am sure. </i></b>One of the miniatures made 
      its way from the darkness and leapt into the “echo”, and it rubbed a hand 
      over the place where the wisp of smoke rejoined it. <b><i>He will be gone 
      for as long as he must be, and until he returns he wishes for me to 
      supervise the continued efforts to enhance the test subjects. As well as 
      release them onto the surface for proliferation when complete.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>This cannot—</i></b>Kaebrix began, 
      but the “echo” was quicker to action and thought. A thin wisp of smoke 
      thrust out from its body and produced an obsidian shard. The wisp split 
      into three tiny homunculus and carried the shard to Kaebrix. They giggled 
      as a tentacle shot from beneath the Consuls robe and took the shard up 
      beneath the folds. They ran into the crevices and hid there. The glib 
      smile returned to the “echo’s” face.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>You see?</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Yes. You are the overseer, very well.
      </i></b>Kaebrix disliked this scenario but he was loyal to Aerbax and 
      trusted him implicitly. <b><i>I bring news.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Speak, Kaebrix. We would hear what it 
      is that you have to say.</i></b> The echo made a summoning gesture with 
      its left arm and the homunculus ran to it, leapt onto its shoulders and 
      ran about its body. Kaebrix paused.&nbsp; <b><i>My children will not betray 
      your words.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>We have begun to rout the loyalists 
      from the Island. They have begun a full retreat. I estimate that they 
      shall be driven completely from the island’s surface within the next 
      turning of the moons.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Excellent! </i></b>The little 
      “echoes” leapt up and down off of its body, clapping and cheering in 
      shrill little voices.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>I have come to seek advice.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>You have…yes. </i></b>The homunculus 
      fell silent and waggled fingers at the “echo” <b><i>Hush now little ones.
      </i></b>They stopped and were pulled back within the “echo’s” form, 
      screaming, no crying, in fear and desperation. <b><i>We shall unleash 
      everything that has been created upon that island. It will be returned to 
      what it once was, and when your Lord returns he shall reward us for our 
      efforts.</i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kaebrix remained silent. The “echo” turned 
      from him, back toward the subject, a small form tried to force its way 
      from his back but was swallowed by inimical shadow. The Island would be 
      flooded with a tide of pollution and depravity unmatched.</font></div>
