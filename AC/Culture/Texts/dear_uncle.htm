    <p><font face="arial" size="2">My dearest uncle,<br>
	<br>
	I do not know how to respond to your last correspondence. You know that I am 
	incapable of such deeds. For good or ill, the man is my king. I have sworn 
	loyalty to him and his house. The fact that we are no longer on Ispar does 
	not change that fact.<br>
	<br>
	And you must remember, one of the oaths I swore was to bring you to justice, 
	dear uncle. My heart does grieve when I contemplate the day when I will meet 
	you in battle. This is not a duty I relish. But it is one that I must 
	fulfill. You should know somewhat of distasteful duties. It was you, after 
	all, who slew the emperor.<br>
	<br>
	Uncle, this will be my last letter to you. Though I am the King's loyal 
	subject, and I have rejected every effort of yours to sway me to your cause, 
	even these letters would be enough to mark me a traitor to the realm. No, 
	this correspondence cannot continue. Should you choose to deliver future 
	letters to me, I will burn them unread. Should you send me messengers under 
	cover of night, I will slay them on sight. Our relationship must end now, 
	uncle. Only once more will we see one another. And that will be on the field 
	of battle.<br>
	<br>
	But I do not want my last words to you to be in anger. No, I would remind 
	you of happier times, of a time when we were still family. Do you remember, 
	uncle, our last trip to Silveran? Of course you do, that is a silly 
	question.<br>
	<br>
	I often think back to that trip, the months we spent in those frigid isles, 
	marveling at the wonders of those strange people. Such beauty and nobility. 
	Your wife, the lady of Silyun, was the fairest woman I ever did see.<br>
	<br>
	Such a love the two of you shared. Though you only saw one another every 
	three years, I never once saw your love falter. It must have been difficult. 
	I cannot imagine being parted from my dear Caprice for even a fortnight. And 
	I cannot imagine the pain your wife must have endured being separated from 
	her child for so long. Did you ever tell her? Did Eleonora ever know that 
	her mother was a princess of the Silveran people? Does she know that she 
	herself is seventh in line for the throne of that frozen kingdom?<br>
	<br>
	That was a wonderful time, my uncle - the happiest of my life. When I think 
	of you, that is what I think of. I do not think on your actions toward our 
	King. I do not think of the war which we fight. I think of our journeys to 
	the north. And I hope that when you think of me, that is what you remember 
	as well.<br>
	<br>
	I love you, my uncle. And I hope we do not meet again.<br>
	<br>
	-Enrico di Bellenesse</font></p>
