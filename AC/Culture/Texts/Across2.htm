	<font face="Arial" size="2">Rain fell in torrential sheets, splattering the 
	already foul mire toward the weeping heavens. For one hundred and twelve 
	cycles it had rained. Ruuk Soothsayers danced around sheltered luminescent 
	fungi and told tales of The Sleeping One, the time of reckoning and the 
	revelations that will bring the circle of vengeance closed. They had long 
	ago cleansed the tainted Fiazhat race from the surface of Bur, their world, 
	but remnants of Fiazhat Gods hunted them still.<br>
	<br>
	Torgluuk, shaman of the Ruuk and master of this Clutch listened 
	half-heartedly to the prattle of his less learned cousins. His thoughts were 
	decidedly on the swamp and the rising waters. For hundreds of years he and 
	his spawn had made their homes in fetid mires, connected by viscous rivers 
	of swale and though they lived in fear of the Fiazhat and their Gods, they 
	knew peace. But that was before the The Sleeping One first stirred and split 
	the world for the second time. Then their larger cousins, the Guruk and 
	Kukuur, had exhumed themselves from subterranean layers to bring war. At 
	first Torgluuk’s elders had argued against their cousins, but the 
	perpetuation of The Sleeping One’s legend slowly ate into the hearts of them 
	all and they readied for war against the Fiazhat.<br>
	<br>
	Two hundred years of war followed. Generations of progeny were sometimes 
	forgotten, allowing the Moars to consume the young, or the few that survived 
	became feral beasts that survived off of the swamp and understood little of 
	the gifts of The Sleeping One. The Ruuk also suffered ignominy at the hands 
	of the Kukuur. Through all of that hardship they had endured and thrived. 
	Though the shamans of the Ruuk would never be as potent as the Elder Shamans 
	of the Kukuur, some, like Torgluuk, came close to rivaling the Kukuur 
	Summoners. But for all their gifts with subterfuge and misdirection the Ruuk 
	were still not able to overthrow the Kukuur and lead the Clutches. Now they 
	were subjugated and sent to the far corners of Bur to safeguard the places 
	where once the Gods of their enemies visited from another place.<br>
	<br>
	This too was a tale from The Sleeping One, the tale that the soothsayer now 
	told by the wan light of the koruu koruu fungus.<br>
	<br>
	“The false ones came from across the vast divide, in tunnels of thunder, 
	smoke and light. They came with gifts for the hated enemy. They came with 
	power for the Fiazhat. They came with slaughter on their minds, the 
	slaughter of the Ruuk, Guruk and Kukuur. But we would not fall!<br>
	<br>
	“So The Sleeping One rumbled beneath the world and gave to its children the 
	koruu koruu, jooluu, huntoo and bormoo fungus. In brew, on flesh, as food, 
	those closest to The Sleeping One could touch the mass of his body and take 
	the gift of magic from him” The soothsayers threw blasts of acid from their 
	hands to accentuate the point. The younger adepts and adherents croaked and 
	whooped in approval. As the cheers dulled, Torgluuk spied three forms 
	swimming toward the camp through the mire. <br>
	<br>
	Straining his eyes to see into the darkness Torgluuk spied three sets of 
	smallish eyes, and heads with thick crowns; clutchmates. Likely, it was the 
	group that set out earlier this stormy night to hunt for bomutuk, a 
	succulent larval form of the bomutur. How such a giant worm, as long as 
	Torgluuk’s arm and plump as his head, could become a flying stinging beast 
	like the bomotuk was beyond even the Kukuur Elder’s understanding. It 
	mattered little to the Ruuk though, both were a tasty dinner and the rains 
	made the bomutur worm slither to the surface of the swamp where it was 
	easier to catch. Morgluuk, Torgluuk’s closest clutchmate and strongest 
	warrior, lead the small hunting band. Torgluuk would be eager to see what 
	was caught. <br>
	<br>
	He slipped down along the branches of the mighty Tkoruk tree and lowered 
	himself into the water with the aid of a vine. Above him the soothsayers 
	continued to dance and sing the tales. They truly believed that the time of 
	the revelations was here. One hundred and twelve cycles had passed without 
	the fire in the sky. It was entirely possible they were right, but Torgluuk 
	wanted to stay focused and alert. The Moars were always nearby these days. 
	As the cool muck of the mire spread onto Torgluuk’s flesh the bormoo that 
	grew there began glowing gold in the night.<br>
	<br>
	“You return with bomutur?” he asked.<br>
	<br>
	“Have we ever failed to find a nest?” Morgluuk asked. Everything Morgluuk 
	said was a challenge. He knew no other way. He was a savage. Most of his 
	time was spent fighting with other savages in the deep swamps where the 
	Moars were most plentiful. He was always fighting. Fighting had become part 
	of everything that he was. He lifted a bushel of bomutur and ordered the 
	other savages to bring the catch up into the Tkoruk and prepare the meal.<br>
	<br>
	“Are the Moars advancing?” Torgluuk asked as he watched the hunters spring 
	from the water to a large branch and then into the glow of the koruu koruu. 
	There was a cheer as they showed the catch and then the soothsayers began 
	again; Torgluuk shook his head.<br>
	<br>
	“You still do not believe? A shaman without the heart of The Sleeping One, 
	how did the fungus not devour your innards?” Morgluuk brushed at the glowing 
	fungus on his clutchmate’s flesh. They shared a small moment of laughter. 
	“They move closer, the others did not see the signs but I see that they 
	close. Fire breathers, talons of ice.”<br>
	<br>
	They stared at one another for a moment.<br>
	<br>
	“Damned be the Fiazhat and their ‘Gods’!” Morgluuk croaked in defiance. 
	“Without their tampering we would rule this world now.”<br>
	<br>
	Torgluuk knew it was true. After the Fiazhat had been eradicated, peace 
	reigned for some time, only to be shattered when the Moars came from the 
	depths and made war again. Since that time they had not known peace. The 
	memories of the ancestors flowed through their veins and so they knew the 
	past, knew that the Fiazhat’s ‘Gods’ had brought this plague upon them.<br>
	<br>
	“They are damned already. The last of their kind fell beneath our blades 
	over 800 years ago. Their ‘Gods’ are dead longer.” Torgluuk drank deeply of 
	the swamp to slake a thirst. “We are the masters of this world. We drive the 
	Moars away whenever they come.”<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk waved a hand dismissively toward Torgluuk and leapt to the vine 
	above them. He began to climb toward the meal and celebration of the tears 
	of The Sleeping One. Torgluuk stared after him a moment and then looked out 
	over the still swamp. Out there were the Moars; they would come for this 
	temple again. The eyes of the false ‘Gods’ stared out to the Moars, calling 
	them to each temple site across Bur. Morgluuk threw a clump of offal down on 
	his clutchmate.<br>
	<br>
	“Come, shaman! You must lead the dinner pray—“His statement was cut short by 
	the sound of thunder. Torgluuk watched as Morgluuk was blasted off the limb 
	of the Tkoruk and unceremoniously deposited into the mire, head first. Other 
	bodies flew through the air, scattering on all sides about Torgluuk, and a 
	muted violet glow throbbed from the mouth of the ancient Fiazhat temple.<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk pulled himself free of the muck and sprang to the side of the 
	Clutch’s leader, sickle and sword drawn. He croaked orders and gave off a 
	scent to warn any that were conscious that they were under attack. He looked 
	at Torgluuk expectantly.<br>
	<br>
	“It is time,” Torgluuk stated without thought. This could only be the sign, 
	the moment about which the soothsayers had been singing only moments before. 
	He had not believed that it was possible, had not wanted to believe that the 
	Fiazhat ‘Gods’ still lived. He looked to his clutchmate and leapt onto the 
	branch of the mighty Tkoruk. Morgluuk followed and ordered the others to 
	stay below.<br>
	<br>
	When they landed and looked at the stone slabs that stood amongst the ruins 
	of the ancient temple they knew immediately that the prophecies were right. 
	The Sleepless One had awakened and their time was now. They looked below at 
	their clutch and croaked in triumph. The echoes of their voices carried deep 
	into the swamp unnerving every manner of beast. Even the Moars would not 
	come this night.<br>
	<br>
	There in the ruins, a tunnel of dark gray mist, swirling lightning and the 
	sound of a thunderhead beckoned. Torgluuk clucked his tongue and looked at 
	Morgluuk.<br>
	<br>
	“I believe.” Torgluuk let a smile spread, showing rows of sharp teeth.<br>
	<br>
	“This is our time brother! Damned be the Kukuur. We, the Ruuk, shall claim 
	this victory!” Morgluuk howled in defiance. Another thunderclap sounded in 
	the sky and the rain suddenly began to clear. Torgluuk turned and walked to 
	the edge of the Tkoruk.<br>
	<br>
	“Ruuk of the Clutch of Tkoruk Guruul, The Sleeping One has sent us the 
	sign!”</font></p>
