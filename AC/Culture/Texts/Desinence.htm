      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The doors, silver-gilt carved sapphire
      stretching floor to ceiling -- impossibly expensive and inconceivably
      heavy -- parted smoothly and soundlessly before him. To one side, a deputy
      in heavy raiment snapped to, his chin lifting and his eyes flashing
      briefly. In response to the man's silent magical command, the temperature
      in the sea-colored crystal chamber dropped precipitously. His breath
      occluded before his own eye.</font></p>
      <font size="2" face="Arial">Such was tradition. Imperial Justice had
      entered the room. Imperial Justice was cool and passionless, saw truth as
      if through pure ice, and was inexorable as a glacier's fall.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a bitter irony, he reflected as he
      strode into the gallery. The Viceroys of Dericost had first made tradition
      of lowering the temperature during such proceedings. It had been a
      tradition of the Old Lords of the Ice Throne. The subjects in those lands
      reflexively became more docile in the chill; more accommodating of their
      fate. The hands of Dericost yet reached from the grave to fold the world's
      destiny on to new courses.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At his next step, a Hieromancer in the
      wings heralded his entrance. “Rise! His Most Serene and Dignified
      Majesty, Emperor Caerlin! Rise!” he bellowed.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Skirts and cloaks rustled in the silence.
      Six figures rose from seats just behind the carved-ivory rail of the
      gallery, silhouetted by mists rising from the warm walls into the sudden
      bitter cold of the air. They bowed to him, master of the Cerulean Throne,
      Emperor of the Thousand Seas, undisputed ruler of the world of Auberean.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ponderous weight of his various titles
      was actually quite embarrassing at times like these. Sometimes he
      suspected that his subjects gave him more accolades every year merely to
      suggest the ever-increasing glory of their own culture.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“We are flattered. Be seated,” Caerlin
      said, cringing inwardly at the necessity of the Imperial Plural. He moved
      to the center dais, three seats to the left, three to the right. He stood
      in the middle, gazing at the floor below the gallery, and gestured with
      his right hand. “You who have brought the charges to Our attention,
      rise, and call upon the accused.” He pulled his hands back into the
      folds of his robe, laying his arms across his barrel chest so that the
      seams disappeared. From below, he himself would appear as a form carved
      from a single piece of sapphire and silver.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Ai, Your Majesty.” The woman -- barely
      more than a girl, really -- stood with slow dignity, like a ribbon
      unknotting itself. With her motion came a chorus of tiny silver bells,
      bone beads clattering one upon another, and the hollow ringing of wood
      upon wood. Peripherally, he noted her long train of hair slipping down to
      cover her exposed lower back, black water falling over rocks.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was uncomfortable murmuring to the
      left, but tradition held that Imperial Justice must keep its eyes on the
      matter at hand. Until the accused was presented, that happened to imply
      the floor where she would appear. Later, he would reprimand them for
      objecting to the Lady of Ithaenc's ceremonial costume. His Empire was
      about deeds, not dress.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bring in the accused,” the Lady said,
      clasping her hands before her stomach. The simple metal hoops adorning her
      arms fell to her wrists in a pile of silver song. Someone swallowed,
      loudly, as this revealed a few of the fresh scars upon her flesh.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Silently, the doors to the floor below the
      gallery swung in. The accused marched out at a deliberate pace, her chin
      high, sea-grey eyes flashing, heading towards the circle carved in the
      center of the floor. Her platinum hair fell only to her shoulders; long
      enough for court, yet short enough to be held away from her face with
      simple plaits.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Caerlin's eyes burned briefly as he
      summoned Majesty to his voice. “Protector of Marae,” he said, the
      modulated tones carrying powerfully throughout the baroque carvings of the
      room. All eyes were drawn magnetically to the source of the voice--from
      the gallery, from the observers' wings, and from the elegant young woman
      on the floor below. A minor glamour, but still effective.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You were summoned before Us for
      judgment. You elected to represent yourself, against the testimony of the
      Lady of Ithaenc. These proceedings have been completed. Are you now
      prepared to meet the judgment of the Seaborne Empire?”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Her chin lifted proudly. He felt her try to
      bring Majesty to her own voice, vainly -- the floor below possessed a
      dispelling field, preventing any use of magic. It would not do for
      prisoners to assault those who looked on them in judgment. “I am well
      prepared, Your Majesty.” He smothered his own look of surprise. Her
      voice projected quite well bereft of magical aids.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You have been found guilty.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She did not flinch, blink, or gasp. She
      simply held her vision locked with his. In them lay the color of
      ice-strewn southern seas.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He expelled the breath he had been holding,
      misting the frigid air.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“What punishment shall the Empire bestow
      upon its humble servant?” she inquired.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You and your line are to be divested of
      your nobility. Your citizenship shall be revoked. You shall be exiled to a
      tower built upon the back of the great southern ice. Your only companions
      shall be the golems that maintain the structure.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“A harsh penalty for inconveniencing a
      few beasts, Caerlin.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Speak with respect, and when you are
      spoken to!” the Hieromancer bellowed from the wings.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You wish to exercise your Right of
      Statement, Lady?” Caerlin said mildly.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I do.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“By all means, then. It shall be noted in
      the annals.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The woman drew herself up. “You who sit
      in these galleries are blind. Blind, ai, and fools in the bargain. Evil
      lies at the root of that island. Mark you my words now, if you have not
      before. One among you must finish the work I began.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“And what have you done in your attempts
      to unearth that root?” the Lady of Ithaenc said, quietly. “Your charge
      as Protector of Marae was to shelter them from all disturbance. Many of us
      here recall your endless petitions for the honor.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You were my only rival, as I recall.”
      The words were said with sly mirth, a tone designed to slither up around
      the hearts of the listeners, nest there, and whisper doubts in the night: <i>This
      woman who sits among you is different. She ties the bones of the dead in
      her hair. She dresses in the cured flesh of creatures slain at ceremony.
      She exposes too much of her own flesh for propriety, and takes a stone
      knife to it in search of the future. Do you truly trust her motives more
      than mine? </i>To the end, she remained among the cleverest of the
      nobility. He would have to speak carefully to undo that damage?</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You broke the bank of the great
      water,” the Lady of Ithaenc pressed. “When that did not expose enough
      of the bones of Marae, you used your art and cunning to fold the waters
      back. In your burning and digging, you led many of true blood to their
      deaths. And in the end, all you have to show for these infamous works is
      the flight of those of whom you were intended to be Protector.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“There was a greater issue than the
      comfort of a few animals.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“They are not animals.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Then why do they bite?”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Caerlin saw the debate veering towards
      theology. The proceedings had not been about that particular issue, they
      had been about the Protector of Marae's failure to complete her charge.
      “Is Our blindness all you wished to remind the Empire of, Lady?” he
      said.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She smiled, a bitter, lopsided thing.
      “Yes, I suppose. I pray that the Empire shall not suffer for what you do
      here, Your Majesty.”</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“If it is to be so, then We shall accept
      the blame of history.”</font></td>
