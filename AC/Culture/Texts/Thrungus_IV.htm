	The following days were miserable.<br>
	<br>
	At first, I declined to provide any details as to the thief's appearance. I 
	merely told those who asked that the thief was cloaked in shadow and that I 
	had not the time to make a proper identification. But none believed me. Not 
	that I have a liar's reputation. No, quite the contrary. The reason they did 
	not believe me is because my reputation is that of a man who always nets his 
	quarry. I have lost neither duel nor battle in all my years as a Knight of 
	Viamont.<br>
	<br>
	When I set out to catch a man, I do not stop until that man is either locked 
	up in the deepest pits of the King's dungeons, or safely pinned beneath the 
	tip of my lance.<br>
	<br>
	So, it was quite inconceivable that I should fail to catch even a glimpse of 
	this thief.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, I made the mistake of trusting General Corcima with the true 
	story of that night. He and I have seen many strange things in our time 
	together on this world.<br>
	<br>
	I thought that surely he would believe me. However, such was not the case.
	<br>
	<br>
	It was only a matter of hours before I grew wise to the whispers and 
	snickers of the guards and townspeople as I walked past. They were laughing 
	at me. The damn fools were laughing at me.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, that all stopped when I decapitated Sir Fusillia by the fountain. 
	Even so, I could feel them staring at me. They believed I was a fool. And 
	that I could not abide.<br>
	<br>
	So I mounted an expedition into the Thrungus hovels. It took me a few nights 
	of searching before I found them. But eventually, I uncovered the abandoned 
	ruins wherein the Thrungum make their home.<br>
	<br>
	The townspeople no longer laugh at me. Instead, they laugh at the Thrungum. 
	These silly little beasts are much too comical to take seriously. However, 
	their laughable demeanor masks quite the brutal fighter.<br>
	<br>
	I have lost more than a couple of good men to these dangerous little beasts. 
	But nowhere near as many as I have lost to the more dangerous Ruschk or 
	Eaters, of course.<br>
	<br>
	Anyhow, the Thrungus hovels have become a fairly popular hunting den. 
	Viamontians new to this world are taken there to learn martial skills which 
	they might not have acquired on Ispar. And, of course, anyone whose 
	possessions mysteriously disappear at night know exactly where to go should 
	they wish to retrieve their sparkly objects<br>
	<br>
	As for the King's belt, I located the thief who had taken it and relieved 
	him of his glittering burden. The King rewarded me quite handsomely for me 
	efforts. And the thief's mushroom cap now graces the wall above my hearth.</font></p>
