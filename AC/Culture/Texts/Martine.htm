      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are reading this, then there is
      still hope.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps. It still may be too late. What
      they have planned...what they are still planning...the loss of blood makes
      it hard for me to concentrate.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Who knew that there would be things to fear
      in a world where death takes no one?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would find the naivete of the innocent
      amusing, were I still innocent. But the road to experience is the destiny
      of all, especially in Dereth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Who am I? Where did I come from? They
      cannot take away my very identity, can they? I am still...I have always
      been...</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My name is Sir Candeth Martine. I think.
      Most of the time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few weeks I ago I had resolved to talk
      about my past on Ispar, to inscribe my story in a text more permanent than
      the apparently flimsy human mind. But I soon forgot to write it down. And
      now I can no more recall my Isparian past than I could recall what life
      was like in my mother's womb. It is gone.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What about my life in Dereth? If I am
      Candeth Martine, surely there should be something that I can remember,
      some constant that I can point to, and say &quot;There. There is the
      proof. I am Candeth Martine. You cannot doubt it any longer.&quot;</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have regained some lucidity. At least for
      now. So I will write quickly. I have kept the above in this letter, to let
      the reader know what I am facing. Indeed, I may have written other
      missives that you have come across, that I no longer remember having
      written. If so, I apologize for my rudeness in not treating you as
      cordially as you deserve.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am Candeth Martine. I have been an
      outcast from my homeworld for some time now. I used to know how long.
      Through some uncommon good fortune, I was able to discover a Society that
      had sprouted up on this alien world. My fellow members of the Society and
      myself resolved to explore and discover this new world, to learn the
      secrets of its flora and fauna, and be able to share this knowledge with
      ourselves and our fellow lost Isparians.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was through a mission given to me by the
      Society that I came upon a large group of Mosswarts. I think I have
      related some of those past events in another letter, but even if I
      haven't, I can barely remember them myself, and I can only hope the
      attentive reader knows that of which I speak.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What I do remember with any certainty is
      this: The Mosswart Chieftain (the closest I can make out his native name
      is Arg Marg. This may be a title instead of a name. It is ironic to me
      that I have been given an opportunity to spend more time with the
      Mosswarts than I ever thought possible, and yet their language remains
      opaque to me. And considering what they gave me when I asked for food, the
      reverse seems true as well. But I digress. I am sometimes prone to
      digression) along with a cadre of his largest warriors absconded with me
      and their apparently sacred Mosswart shroud.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We made our way through the endless sands
      in darkness. I was cold, hungry and exhausted. I had not been able to
      enjoy any taste of freedom for many days. I could not recall a time since
      I had arrived in Dereth where I had been so close to the point of complete
      physical and mental collapse.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was foolish not to be able to enjoy
      paradise when I saw it. It is only now that I know what Hell is.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Do not trust the Virindi. Do not trust the
      Virindi. Do not trust the Virindi. Do not trust the Virindi. Do not trust
      the Virindi. Do not trust the Virindi. Do not trust the Virindi. Do not
      trust</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Is it possible that we here in Dereth have
      lost our sense of smell? I have heard from many of my friends and
      colleagues about the mass Tusker slaughters that go on throughout the
      land. Hours are spent reveling in the blood and guts of these huge beasts.
      How can humans stand it? After spending some time with Tuskers who managed
      to keep their blood and guts on the inside for the duration of the visit,
      I cannot comprehend how much worse their stench can get.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is easier for me if I focus on the
      Tuskers. The other minions are...too much like their masters.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Why were the Mosswarts meeting with
      the...the...those things? If only I could decipher what was said. The
      portal was opened, Arg Marg stepped through along with his bodyguards and
      the shroud. They were obviously very happy when the portal was created.
      Even happier to step through. I had thought they might at least try and
      say goodbye. At the time I wondered what the Mosswarts had to exchange in
      return for such obvious favors. The idea that I was the trade had never
      occurred to me.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mosswarts fighting for the Shadows.
      Mosswarts fighting for the Undead. Mosswarts cooperating with
      the...things. What sense does all this make? Mosswart Idols littering the
      landscape of this exotic new island. Does the Society know about this
      place? Do I even care? Please find me. Please release me. I'll say what
      you want me to say. I promise. Just stop.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Virindi are our friends. The Virindi
      are our friends. The Virindi are our friends. The Virindi are our friends.
      The Virindi are our friends. The Virindi are our friends. The Virindi are
      our friends.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More portals. Where are they taking me to
      this time? They are ignoring the note. Are they even aware it exists? They
      know I exist. Do I exist? Who am I? I wish they would stop hurting this
      Candeth Martine. His cries are keeping me up at night. It would be easier
      if I could sleep.</font></td>
