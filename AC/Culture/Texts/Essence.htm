      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have for too long now, sat removed from 
      you, turning a blind eye to the horrors that you have been subjected to so 
      recently. <br>
      <br>
      Candeth Martine, has on at least one occasion tried to take my life, and 
      has threatened the life of your High Queen's son. Now it appears that the 
      monster means to awaken arts that have long been buried beneath the world 
      in the forms of elemental magics.<br>
      <br>
      There are reasons that those practices were halted and I shall espouse 
      some of what I know on the subject here.<br>
      <br>
      Magic is. There is no way around that, and here on Ireth Lassel, Dereth, 
      to you and the other Isparians, the fields of magic and lines that run 
      beneath Auberean are strongest. <br>
      <br>
      It is here that we set up our grandest research facilities and established 
      societies specifically for the furthering of magical arts. We were a race 
      with little in the way of enemies, filled with a boundless curiosity. It 
      was that curiousity that was our undoing. But we stopped several times 
      before when we discerned a pattern, or rather a break in the pattern of 
      what is.<br>
      <br>
      Essence, is the term which I have come to use to describe what you call 
      mana. It flows through every being regardless of whether they choose to 
      harness it or not. Beneath the world it flows, and ebbs like the tides of 
      the ocean, but instead of being on a set schedule, it moves through set 
      patterns.<br>
      <br>
      At the points where these pools have coalesced into tangible reality, what 
      you call the Essence of Strife, Artifice etc... they have been pooled in 
      what appears to be giant cisterns, whose sole purpose is the collection of 
      the essence that flows beneath the world.<br>
      <br>
      I have not spent much time in studying them. During the height of our age, 
      my attentions were elsewhere, and their resurgence at the defeat of 
      Bael'zharon made them appear as though they were something that my people 
      had inadvertently stifled when we first trapped the Hopeslayer. So it was 
      nothing more than a boon for you and yours when the magic of the world 
      surged with power.<br>
      <br>
      But now, I wonder.<br>
      <br>
      I have watched these placed and see something odd.<br>
      <br>
      The workmanship is reminiscent of the Gelid Age. When those that once 
      lived on the Gelid Plain struggled and toiled to reestablish their hold on 
      the world against the Yalain and our allies. Their effort, you have seen 
      before in the great work at Frore. A device established to syphon, the 
      power of something else...<br>
      <br>
      I shall not go into a history lesson there. <br>
      <br>
      Essence is as magic is. It is an all encompassing force that can be broken<br>
      into to structured categories that are described by the various schools 
      that you possess. To you and the other Isparians, there are four schools.<br>
      <br>
      To Nuhmudira, and a few others who have attempted to decipher the arts 
      that the Yalain once practiced there are several more. Though the effects 
      that you can evoke differ greatly from what I can do. <br>
      <br>
      It is not a slight to you Isparians, it simply is. In time as it has been 
      shown by Nuhmudira, perhaps you could learn the greater aspects of magic, 
      but I do not know.<br>
      <br>
      Thus far it is only Nuhmudira and the altered human, Candeth Martine that 
      have grasped the higher concepts of magic, and put them into use.<br>
      <br>
      Further, essence is the whole. The completeness of magic and the 
      understandings and working that it becomes. <br>
      <br>
      Borelean, Ely's son, has asked me on occasion where the elementals came 
      from. I must confess that I took the liberty of telling him a falsity.<br>
      <br>
      Elementals are an aspect of essence, coalesced, given form and given 
      consciousness by a master. This practice took place within a very small 
      sect of beings eons ago. Those beings were destroyed utterly, by their 
      kin. The Gelid.<br>
      <br>
      The ones that roamed Ireth Lassel for the past centuries, are remnants of 
      those that were created by this cult, that was destroyed. They have no 
      masters, besides themselves and it appears that they have the ability to 
      create more.<br>
      <br>
      This is not so frightening a thought, until<br>
      <br>
      you take into account the process by which it appears that they were made.<br>
      <br>
      Essence was collected. Stolen in massive quantities from beneath the 
      Menhir Rings, and forcibly bent into willing forms , imprinted with a 
      connection to the summoner/binders mind. The essence took on an aspect of 
      the element that it was most closely akin to. So that if the wellspring of 
      essence came from near Mount Esper it was flame...etc...meaning that it 
      took on it's basest form. But the siphoning of this power left the magic 
      field weak and devoured the magic from the land<br>
      <br>
      The power instead was redirected into the masters of the &quot;elemental&quot;, and 
      the elemental itself.<br>
      <br>
      Over time it was thought that the elementals would siphon the conduits of 
      essence under the world dry, leaving no room for magic other than its most 
      base forms upon the world. Meaning that those that practiced magic would 
      become powerless, and the elementals would grow in power to a point where 
      they could replicate themselves at an alarming rate. Perhaps even fusing 
      together into types that could not be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, the Gelid quelled this renegade faction. <br>
      <br>
      A simple problem however remained. There were some elementals that were 
      already imprinted with the connection to their masters, and when their 
      masters died, these elementals were left with powerful shards of thought 
      from their former masters. This made them able to create more of their ilk 
      to sustain their line, so to speak, over the ages.<br>
      <br>
      Now, in the current age, your age. It has become apparent that Martine 
      means to <br>
      <br>
      awaken this long dead practice. He is unawares of the damage that he could 
      possibly wreak. Or he consciously wishes to see this world destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      I will not see that happen, not because this is my world, because I will 
      not see any more needless suffering here. To that end I have approached 
      the Arcanum and have been assisting your High Queen with endeavours to 
      bolster the Isparians.<br>
      <br>
      My first such contact with the Arcanum yielded an unexpected find that I 
      have dispatched my emissary to assist them with.<br>
      <br>
      As hypocrtical as this may sound, I am opening a way to a font of essence. 
      There you will collect pure mana so that you may forge new weapons from 
      pyreal to better combat the enemies that will rise to face you. Use it 
      wisely.<br>
      <br>
      I have dispatched diggers to a place near the Sho village Kara. There they 
      will construct a place of safe passage to the essence font. You can then 
      collect the essence and return to your Arcanum for furhter assistance. I 
      have taught them all I know.<br>
