    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Greetings. If you are in possession of this missive then you have chosen to 
    assist in the collection of the entity known as the Harbinger. I thank you 
    for your offer and welcome any assistance that you may be able to provide.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am sure that my colleague, Vincadi, has imparted the details of the 
    challenges we face in regards to this endeavor, and I am pleased to see that 
    you still possess the gumption to stand by our side. <br>
    <br>
    As you are likely aware, the Virindi loyal to my cause have shunned the 
    Quiddity's yoke, and have begun attempts to ascertain the truths of the 
    self. Vincadi has become adept at expression and free thought. <br>
    <br>
    He desired to make contact with your species in order to study your forms 
    and learn what makes you each so unique. Thus far he has learned that it is 
    mostly attributed to your emotions. He particularly enjoys the smile that 
    sometimes graces your faces. I digress. <br>
    <br>
    Since Levistras's failure I have been under harsh scrutiny. Virindi do not 
    register personality. Virindi do not lie. Virindi are not capable of masking 
    thought, and yet I have achieved ability with each of these. I have become a 
    thinking entity, and my experimentation has been further because of these 
    new feelings. I am pleased. <br>
    <br>
    Recent incarnations of testing have yielded more potent, and individually 
    destructive iterations on previous successes. <br>
    <br>
    For example: The Drudges that have recently been integrated into the wild 
    are my latest accomplishment. Conversely the Banderlings seem to be a 
    natural progression of their species. The Drudges have always offered a 
    unique, and complex specimen. Their cranial cavities are large, containing a 
    grey matter that is equally as large. However, the grey matter seems to have 
    been victim to a cruel punishment of nature as the potential of the species 
    is diminished by an inability to form coherent thought for any length of 
    time. <br>
    <br>
    I have found, through years of testing that rote can circumvent the failings 
    of nature and thus alter the intelligence of the Drudge to mimic a learned, 
    or programmed response. This had been my greatest success; however, with the 
    assistance of an Energy Source, recently discovered in a remote laboratory, 
    I have been able to accurately imprint the seeds of personality to some 
    drudges with which I tamper. The greatest of these results roam the dire 
    wilderness areas of this physical plane. <br>
    <br>
    With these successes and the successes I have achieved with study on others 
    of my species I have come to the ultimate conclusion that this energy source 
    is capable of releasing the greatest potential in any being. Thus in the 
    interest of scientific curiosity I am endeavoring to acquire a great 
    specimen to either prove, or disprove my theory. <br>
    <br>
    It is to that end that I have sent Vincadi to interact with you, and his 
    words have obviously swayed you in some fashion as you have at the very 
    least agreed to view our proposal. <br>
    <br>
    Many of the new variants that have made an appearance on the surface of this 
    physical plane have been my doing, other are not. I wish a collection of 
    minor specimens so that I may track down these specimens in their natural 
    habitat when the proclivity to test these subjects arises. The greatest of 
    these specimens is the entity that you Isparians refer to as the Harbinger.
    <br>
    <br>
    In order to prove your dedication to assisting me in this undertaking I 
    require that you first provide me with a token that proves you wish to 
    assist me once and for all. <br>
    <br>
    Vincadi will collect these objects and has been given the necessary 
    understanding to reward you greatly for your efforts. Should you choose to 
    accept this undertaking read further. If not, cease. <br>
    <br>
    I am aware that you have an obsession with improving yourselves, you never 
    seem to be completely satisfied until you attain the pinnacle that nature 
    will allow you, and so I wish to offer you assistance in achieving that 
    potential. My reward is simply that. I will further your ability in 
    whichever of the skills you desire. <br>
    <br>
    Vincadi will channel the knowledge to you once you have chosen which skill 
    you wish to advance. To do this you must provide a leaving of one of the 
    following species. The object you offer will correspond to the skill you 
    desire to enhance. I have instructed Vincadi to utilize the following chart 
    for acceptance and dissemination of rewards: <br>
    <br>
    Drudge Cabalist Charm = Life Magic <br>
    Banderling Aggressor Scalp = War Magic <br>
    Murk Drudge Charm = Creature Magic <br>
    Insidious Monouga Idol = Item Magic <br>
    Peerless Drudge Charm = Magic Defense <br>
    Telumiat Hollow Minion Mist = Melee Defense <br>
    Savage Banderling Arm = Missile Defense <br>
    Reedshark Reaper Hide = Unarmed Combat <br>
    Olthoi Mutilator Head = Sword <br>
    Banderling Bone Ring = Dagger <br>
    Rendeath Shreth Hide = Axe <br>
    Skeleton Primeval Shin Bone = Mace <br>
    Gauloth Shreth Hide = Spear <br>
    Gloom Drudge Charm = Staff <br>
    Drudge Bloodletter Charm = Bow <br>
    Dark Master Skull = Thrown Weapons <br>
    Banderling Predator Scalp = Crossbow <br>
    Reedshark Slasher Hide = Alchemy <br>
    Plate Armoredillo Hide = Item Tinkering <br>
    Drudge Mystic Charm = Magic Item Tinkering <br>
    Drudge Sage Charm = Armor Tinkering <br>
    Bloodthirsty Monouga Idol = Weapon Tinkering <br>
    Banderling Antagonist Scalp = Cooking <br>
    Banderling Slayer Scalp = Fletching <br>
    Merciless Monouga Idol = Lockpick <br>
    Drudge Ravener Guts = Leadership <br>
    Obsidian Golem Heart = Loyalty <br>
    Wood Golem Heart = Assess Creature <br>
    Ash Gromnie Tooth = Assess Person <br>
    Phantasm Essence = Mana Conversion <br>
    Copper Golem Heart = Jump <br>
    Iron Golem Heart = Run <br>
    Granite Golem Heart = Deception <br>
    Skeleton Hero Skull = Arcane Lore <br>
    <br>
    As you can see each of the items you harvest from these creatures 
    corresponds to a skill that you might have knowledge of. Choose one and only 
    one and I will assist you on reaching your maximum, natural, potential. If 
    you are already at your maximum natural potential then Vincadi's efforts 
    will fail, he is not as experienced as I and cannot bring you beyond your 
    natural <br>
    potential. <br>
    <br>
    Of course, this is only the first of your efforts. The bulk of your venture 
    will come when you enter into the tunnels that we have established to the 
    Harbinger's lair. <br>
    <br>
    Be warned that we have enemies. These enemies have established a network of 
    tunnels of their own. We have assaulted their efforts to ensure that the 
    specimen can be collected without being corrupted, in turn they have invaded 
    our access points. <br>
    <br>
    They are lead by a potent mage, who has also circumvented our control over 
    the portal flux. While this is consternating, I am more interested in the 
    acquisition of the specimen, and therefore desire that you eliminate their 
    forces only as a secondary measure. Your primary concerns is the weakening 
    of the Harbinger entity. <br>
    <br>
    Once we become aware of the Harbinger entity's destruction we will summon 
    forth a portal for you to utilize. <br>
    <br>
    Be sure to complete this process. <br>
    <br>
    You will be sanitized and returned to Vincadi. He will only know that you 
    have completed your task if you have gone through the sanitation process.
    <br>
    <br>
    I wish you luck. <br>
