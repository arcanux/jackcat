	THonored Antius, <br>
	Here are my first rough observations after an extensive reconnaissance of 
	the Viamontian fortifications. I have scouted four forts around Zaikhal, 
	each of them meant to be a launching point for the assault on the city. They 
	have delved deep underground, with the assistance of renegade Lugians. They 
	have completed a portal transport network with the assistance of Virindi. In 
	short, the Viamontian King has struck up two powerful alliances in 
	relatively short order. <br>
	<br>
	The fort south of Zaikhal is the home of the King's Copper Legion. These 
	knights seem to be responsible for the maintenance of the creatures known s 
	&quot;Eaters&quot; - horrible, slavering beasts capable of chewing through the 
	stoutest plate armor. I gather these beasts will be used as front-line 
	assault weapons, preceding the Knight legions into battle. The leader of the 
	Copper Legion is Captain Ramelle, who seems to be the most junior of the 
	invasion commanders. <br>
	<br>
	The western fort seems to be a sort of embassy with the Lugians. A great 
	number of Lugian renegades, from the &quot;Gotrok&quot; faction, seem to be encamped 
	in the underground complex. This complex is also home to the Silver Legion 
	of Viamont, under Captain Argenne. <br>
	<br>
	The eastern fort of the Gold Legion, under the leadership of Captain 
	Aurichon, also holds a number of Virindi. The Virindi have helped the 
	Viamontians with their portal network, and I have had difficulty figuring 
	out which faction of Virindi is truly involved. Blame it on the 
	inscrutability of those hovering masks, whom it seems I have spent my entire 
	life spying upon, and have left me plenty of sickle-shaped scars and 
	lightning burns to remember them by. <br>
	<br>
	The terrifying Captain Balanchi is leader of the Platinum Legion, in command 
	of the northern fort. He seems to be the closest to the King and to the 
	invasion's overall commander, a man named General Corcima. The Platinum 
	Legion boasts the toughest soldiers of the invasion, and Captain Balanchi 
	has been entrusted with the supply chain back to Viamont - all of the 
	weapons and armor for use in the invasion, as well as the treasure meant to 
	buy the services of their allies, pass through the hands of Captain Balanchi 
	first. <br>
	<br>
	Each of the leaders seems to have a direct link to the Viamontian islands 
	northwest of Dereth. I have witnessed the Captains and their bodyguards 
	using gems to move directly to their home fortress. I am not so much of a 
	fool as to try and take one of these soldiers down to investigate it for 
	myself. However, the conversations I have overheard indicate the presence of 
	a great castle near the Viamontian lands, under the command of a royal 
	cousin of King Varicci, an astute general named Corcima di Corcosa. <br>
	<br>
	I saw Corcima visit the Platinum Legion keep just a few days ago. While he 
	is a fearsome warrior (and he must be to command the respect of the 
	Viamontian legions), he is also an intelligent man with an air of power and 
	command. <br>
	<br>
	Corcima has one odd habit, which he displayed during his visit. He actually 
	cut himself and smeared some of his own blood on the helm of his soldiers! I 
	know Viamontians place great stock in the power of blood, especially royal 
	blood, but I do not know what purpose the blood serves. <br>
	<br>
	Incidentally, honored Antius, General Corcima wears a beautiful set of some 
	kind of plate armor. I have never seen its like. If only there were some way 
	to get you a sample of its material. Uncle Aliester once told me you are 
	quite the armorsmith... I would be quite interested to see what kind of 
	armor you could make if only you could inspect a piece of Corcima's suit. </font></p>
