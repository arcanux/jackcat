<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thy concerns are noted, my
    old friend. I assure thee, this course was not chosen without all due
    deliberation in Chalicemere. The Council, and the Steward, reached a rare
    accord with the skulking Filinuvekta. It is dangerous to oppose the forces
    of the Servant, true. I would be a fool if I pretended otherwise. Thou hast
    asked me, &quot;What price will the Firstborn pay this time, for the mere
    promise of a return to power on the morrow?&quot;</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I tell you, and I pray you
    hear with a generous heart, this manner of thinking is painfully
    short-sighted. If the Servant succeeds, we shall suffer in the end. This is
    no simple war for dominance he wages. Nay, it be a campaign to absorb all
    things living. The Lords would tell you that their concern is solely the
    preservation of mortals, for us to rule later. All they can see is the need
    for a future kingdom. But do not delude yourself, as they do, that we who
    walked when the Ice Throne held sway over half the world will survive long,
    once the living are done away with. In this, at least, the Winds are
    correct. It is in our best interest to stand against the Servant now, while
    we do not yet stand alone.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I fought at Ayn Tayan,
    brother. The Dark Spawn are ultimately mortal as any man. If one cuts them,
    they will bleed. The blood is tarry, and withers the grass where it lands. I
    saw much of it spilled over the course of those three endless days of
    butchery. We held against the Spawns' weight of numbers, and though the
    price was high for us, t'was a victory in the end. How the army cheered when
    Anadil's spells toppled the Thorn!</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He has come up from his dusty
    crypt, you know. The greatest of the remaining Sand Kings has agreed to lead
    the armies of the Lords once more. He gathers the forces of the Latzimestal
    in the wastes, holding moot with our captains and the agents of Filinuvekta,
    who walk far in dark places, and have seen and heard much which may assist
    us.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Anadil has a great plan,
    brother. I cannot speak of it, lest this message be somehow intercepted.
    Come to us at Chalicemere. They shall tell thee of Anadil's rallying point,
    and there I shall tell thee how the Darkness will be kept in check.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Until then, keep safe, and
    hasten. The sun has dimmed, and now the stars begin to fall.</font></td>
