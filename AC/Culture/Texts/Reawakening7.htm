        <font face="Arial" size="2">“How dare you!?” Oswald slipped out of the 
        shadow and landed with his dirk drawn. “Our contract!”</font><p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">“You failed.” Nuhmudira sat calmly in her 
        chair. Three nights had left her feeling healthier and sure of herself. 
        The voices were quieter, more manageable, all but gone. Oswald, on the 
        other hand, was a petty thing. He had burst into her home, riding the 
        shadow and the wind, nothing more than a whisper of smoke the scent of 
        mandrake. “I have exacted my price.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You underestimate me, woman. I am beyond 
        your touch now. I could easily—”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Brag some more? Perhaps assail my ears 
        with these petty arguments into the night? Or would you stand there 
        across from an old and withered woman, with your weapon drawn and be so 
        tame as to continue with idle threats and idiocy.” Nuhmudira snapped 
        back, but remained seated and calm. “You’re a simple, and sadly, 
        inefficient tool. You could not complete your end of the bargain, and 
        since we had an agreement I have exacted the recompense that I could…”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oswald opened his pouch, and produced a 
        jet black pearl, “Take it back…this was the payment that you gave me for 
        her. If I failed at that…then take this. You cannot take the power of 
        his soul. It is mine!”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yours?” she quipped, a second voice not 
        her own layered over the top. She forced it down and continued. “I 
        taught you the rite. Showed you the methodology and provided you the 
        means for your transformation. I am your mother, and you have shamed 
        me.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You’re mad.” He shook his head. “Mad…you 
        think that you command more power than I? Your magic…it can affect the 
        things that I have created, and weaken the bond perhaps…but…you cannot 
        take it all. I will find another way.”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira laughed, and all the voices 
        joined her, “You? You are a not a competent assassin. How shall you 
        unlock the mysteries that I command?”</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You forget Nuhmudira…you showed me the 
        way.” He smiled and the light of her candle glinted off of his teeth. 
        His dirk blazed forward and slipped between her ribs. Her breath came in 
        one quick burst as she toppled backward out of her chair. Blood welled 
        into her mouth and she coughed, spattering her face and the wall behind 
        her. The second stroke caught her across the throat and sent a shower of 
        red into the air. The third struck her arm as she caught sight of his 
        hands in the dark. The blade slipped cleanly between the bones of her 
        lower arm and she twisted it hard. Pain mattered little. She heard her 
        breath as it gurgled past the welling blood and she felt light-headed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oswald rolled away from her, slipping 
        into the shadow. His blade turned into a thin line of smoke and trailed 
        away from Nuhmudira. The fourth blow struck her in two waves. The first 
        was a kick to the back of her skull. As she flipped from the floor, into 
        the air, she felt the sting of the blade in her lower back. The world 
        spun and darkness threatened to swallow her, but she was not about to 
        die. She spoke a word that halted the flow of blood from her wounds.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oswald stayed in the shadow, waiting for 
        the moment to strike the final blow. Two of the wounds that he had 
        struck her should be fatal, but Nuhmudira, like Elysa, was resilient. 
        When she landed with a hard thump on the far side of her room, he slid 
        into the shadow and beneath her bed. He rode the darkness there and 
        emerged on the other side, embedding the blade into Nuhmudira’s skull. 
        She twitched, kicked once and then lay still.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I’m the best at–” His words were cut 
        short as a bolt of energy washed over him, through him, and tore his 
        being asunder. As he began to drift away as smoke rising on the wind, he 
        saw the Nuhmudira that he had killed sizzle and melt into the floor.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No, Oswald…I am.” Nuhmudira’s hand 
        clutched the wound at her neck as she walked to the illusion she had 
        created. It drifted away to nothing as she closed the wounds on her 
        neck, arm, back and chest.</font></div>
