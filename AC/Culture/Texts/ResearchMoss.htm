    <br>
    After my first interaction with the &quot;energy source&quot; I set about collecting 
    new subjects. The intended goal was to witness and classify the effects of 
    the source upon the material make-up of other beings. I had witnessed 
    infusions of energies so great as to reinforce the strength of Puppets to 
    near equivalence to the Quiddity's own agents the Inquisitors, but these 
    interactions were restricted to being capable of dealing with pure energy.
    <br>
    <br>
    My first test was with a controlled group of &quot;croakers&quot;, the same that 
    parlayed with us <br>
    <br>
    for the capture of the &quot;Martine&quot; entity. <br>
    <br>
    Collection was swift and a fair cross-section was obtained. Groups were 
    arranged as one mana manipulator, one without such ability and one who was a 
    potent mix of both. Three such groups were created. <br>
    <br>
    Group #1: This group was contained within a cell structure in the Asylum 
    where they were kept away from the other two groups, no enhancement or work 
    was performed upon them. <br>
    <br>
    Group #2: This group was brought to the Athenaeum and worked upon by myself 
    and enhanced Puppets as Master's provided assistance to their once pawns.
    <br>
    <br>
    Group #3: The final group was taken to the shallow where the &quot;energy source&quot; 
    is most abundantly available and exposed over long periods of time. <br>
    <br>
    Findings: <br>
    <br>
    Group #1 remained wholly unchanged, though the time they were kept apart 
    from their collective altered their behavior to <br>
    <br>
    become more erratic and frenzied. Ultimately they suffered from a slight 
    madness, and nothing more. <br>
    <br>
    Group #2 showed a fair capacity to survive through our more extreme 
    proddings but the enhancements were not compatible with their meat forms and 
    the three subjects ceased within a moon cycle of implantation. <br>
    <br>
    Group #3 suffered greatly while within the presence of the energy source.
    <br>
    <br>
    The &quot;croaker&quot; with a capability with both mana energy and material capacity 
    was twisted horribly. Internal structure snapped twisted, protru<span lang="en-us">d</span>ed 
    through discoloring skin. It tough meat bubbled, redoubled and grew into 
    immense structures that swelled and threatened to burst beneath the 
    discoloring flesh bag that surrounded its innards. <br>
    <br>
    The &quot;croaker&quot; with no ability to manipulate mana energies suffered less. The 
    area about its head flattened, became restricted and elongated. As did its 
    arm and leg structures, snapping noises came from within its body <br>
    <br>
    as the meat within realigned to the new structure of its form. A slight 
    discoloration appeared in the hew of its flesh and rows of thin sharp teeth 
    appeared along the place were it ingested. <br>
    <br>
    The pure mana manipulating &quot;croaker&quot; suffered the worst. Boils appeared on 
    its fl<span lang="en-us">e</span>sh and it began to swell horribly along all 
    the joining points of its interior structure. Its flesh stretched and 
    contorted as bulbous masses began to appear beneath. Screams were muted by 
    gurgles as its neck swelled and the only sound louder than the gurgle was 
    the sound of internal structure <br>
    <br>
    expanding twisting breaking, rehealing and snapping again. The &quot;croaker&quot; 
    grew in size towering over the others, snapping the bonds we had put in 
    place and issuing commands to the other two. Flesh hung from its form in 
    swaying masses. As the commands were issued the other began tearing at their 
    bonds and the largest harnessed mana energy. <br>
    <br>
    Without hesitation we destroyed the subjects. Necessity. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: &quot;Croakers&quot; cannot survive the process without becoming 
    detrimentally <br>
    <br>
    and irreversibly altered. Further experimentation is ceased</font><font class="BaseFont"><font class="patchItem"><br>
