    <p><font size="2"><br>
    </font><font face="arial" size="2">The word we have from our spies in 
    Haebrous has been most interesting. It seems that the games of mortality 
    that the Haebreans find so diverting have recently become a bitter 
    spectacle. A gladiator in their great arena united their slaves and led a 
    rebellion that devastated the city. Their obnoxious little queen died at the 
    center of the arena, beheaded by the rebel leader, a barbarian outlander 
    named Grael. We have heard that the gladiator went so far as to cut out her 
    heart and eat it in front of his cheering followers.<br>
    <br>
    We did not need dispatches from our spies to know that something had gone 
    deliciously wrong in Haebrous. The tremendous slaughter of the gladiator 
    rebellion sent ripples throughout the planes. From our perch here on 
    Vissidal, we could almost smell the blood and fire in the streets of their 
    proud city. The Watchers seemed almost... cheerful during the three days of 
    terror that shook Braletain's realm.<br>
    <br>
    We have, of course, sent agents to investigate the nature of this Grael 
    barbarian. We know that Grael was a warrior of a native tribe on the 
    northern frontier of Haebrous. These primitives called themselves &quot;Mukkir&quot; 
    and put up such a ferocious fight against the Haebreans that Braletain's 
    soldiers exterminated every one, save for the single warrior that they 
    brought back as a prize for the fighting pit. We laugh in delight at the 
    bloody revenge that Grael took on behalf of his people.<br>
    <br>
    We must confess some jealousy at Grael's astonishing accomplishment. The 
    slaughter of an arena full of Haebreans and the spectacular ritual execution 
    of their young queen drew much attention from the Watchers. We also know 
    that Grael somehow escaped Braletain's vengeance, even as his followers were 
    annihilated by the diluted magical arts of the Haebrean royal &quot;thaumaturges&quot;. 
    Again, we cannot help but admire Grael's resourcefulness and willingness to 
    abandon those whom he no longer needed.<br>
    <br>
    The Watchers will not speak to us directly about Grael. The soft voices who 
    have breathed to us the secrets of making and unmaking remain curiously and 
    conspicuously silent on this one subject. Of course, we gather knowledge in 
    our own way, even if the Watchers refuse us the answers we seek. We can 
    listen to the turning of the Wheel of All Things, and we can hear echoes in 
    the darkness that even they cannot. This is a legacy taught to us by those 
    who were our masters before...<br>
    <br>
    And the echoes have told us that the Watchers seek Grael for their use, but 
    they argue over what this use may be. There are some among them who believe 
    he is the one whose coming was foretold, who would bring about a great 
    Sending and cover the world in Living Darkness. There are some who believe 
    he is too much of an uncontrolled power even for those who revel in chaos. 
    There are some who believe he is not the Messenger, but that he will prove 
    to be a useful vessel of power even so.<br>
    <br>
    We hear these voices the strongest - that Grael is an outlander, not 
    Haebrean, Yalaini, Dericostian, or Falatacot - and thus a flawed and 
    imperfect vessel for the mickle energies of the Living Darkness. But Grael 
    possesses something that no Empyrean does: a transcendent and transforming 
    rage, a heart filled with the kind of pure, perfect hate which will make him 
    a perfect conduit for the Watchers' powers, the powers of war and 
    destruction and despair.<br>
    <br>
    We can see some of what will befall Grael. The currents of fortune swirl 
    thickly about this gladiator. This, too, is a gift of an earlier legacy, a 
    knowledge we have kept to ourselves, within ourselves, and concealed from 
    the Watchers. But even without this ability to see swatches of the fabric of 
    creation before it is woven, there are things we could predict out of simple 
    sense.<br>
    <br>
    rael will not be the Messenger who is foretold. He is not pureblood like our 
    kind, nor even akin to us, as the Yalaini, Haebreans, and the Dericostians 
    are, and he is thus incapable of wielding the full prophesied power that the 
    Messenger would carry. But he will serve as an experimental subject for the 
    Dark Ones. They will wrap him in thorns, in a mantle of Living Darkness. 
    They will give him life everlasting within the Darkness, and they will teach 
    him to bring True Death. They will teach him to extinguish the light of 
    creation.<br>
    <br>
    And then they will watch him, and observe how he fares with the gifts of the 
    Living Shadow. They will learn what happens when a mortal is bathed in the 
    power of true darkness. We think the Watchers will be surprised. Grael is 
    even more unpredictable than they believe. Grael is flesh of this world, and 
    thus they cannot perfectly know his nature. Even worse for them, Grael is 
    more cunning than they suspect. He will take their gifts, and make them his 
    own. He will become something none of us can know.<br>
