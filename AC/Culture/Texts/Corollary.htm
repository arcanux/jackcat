    by Aliester the Loquacious<br>
    <br>
      </small></font><font face="Arial" size="2">In the wake of the recent
      attacks on our honored gemstone armor smiths, my colleagues and I have
      embarked upon extensive investigations into the properties of shadows,
      crystal beasts, and gems. The weakening by repeated death of our three
      master smiths, while a terrible tragedy and an ill omen for all Dereth,
      has actually provided exciting new avenues of inquiry. The fused gems
      never cease to amaze us with their versatility and mystifying qualities.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Due to a precipitous loss in their skills,
      the master smiths are no longer able to invest as much of the fused gems'
      power in the armor suits they craft. More specifically, the gemstone
      armor's power, have suffered dramatically. My esteemed colleague Gondo
      Kanezo has bent his considerable mental prowess to an effort to restore
      the lost elemental strength. Thanks to my own research in the abstract
      realm of the armor's abstract qualities, we may have found a solution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It all goes back to the legendary work of
      the Lady Maila, once the head of a great school of learning in the
      Empyrean civilization. Artifacts and writing point to Lady Maila as a
      sorceress and enchantress of great power and learning. We know she was
      part of the mage council that crafted the crystals, means of imprisoning
      the essence of Bael'Zharon and exiling him from our mortal realm. We also
      know from more recently unearthed evidence that Lady Maila was
      instrumental in the creation of the stones used to empower Atlan weapons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Far be it from me to criticize a lady of
      great learning and accomplishment, but it seems that Lady Maila took some
      of the shortcuts which all of us involved in magical experimentation and
      creation are wont to use. It seems Lady Maila re-used many of the
      alchemical and magical techniques she used in the elemental stones'
      crafting when she and her council decided to craft great crystals to
      imprison Bael'Zharon. I will not fault the Lady Maila for this method. No
      doubt her ability to borrow from her previous work simplified the process
      of creating the crystal array.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Serendipitously enough, Lady Maila's work
      of convenience becomes quite a boon to our people, the inheritors of the
      war against the shadows. As any mage worth his reagents knows, sympathy
      and resonance is indispensable to proper and effective magical work. The
      fused gems, one half crystal essence, seem to have an affinity to the
      resonance of the elemental stones, crafted as they were by the same great
      mage. One can only hope that we sages and the magicians of Dereth will be
      able to leave as strong and enduring a legacy as the honored Lady Maila.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This resonance remained undetected for so
      long because the fused gems sacrificed so much of their power to the
      strength of the armor. With the inert metal of the armor leeching away
      less of the gems' essence, the suits themselves become more compatible
      with the resonance of the greater elemental stones.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Gondo Kanezo has confirmed that the new
      suits of armor, while intrinsically less powerful that their previous
      incarnations, can be imbued with the strength of the elemental stones. The
      individual stones confer a greater resistance to their associated elements
      than the original suits of gemstone armor were ever able to provide,
      though it must be noted that drastic improvement comes at the price of
      increased vulnerability to the 'opposed' element.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The effect of the Atlan stones, however,
      are not solely beneficial. When the armor takes on the elemental
      properties of the stones, and even becomes physically, it becomes
      resistant to magical enhancement. Thus the armor becomes immune to the
      augmentation normally provided by Item magic. The elemental stones need to
      be removed from the pieces of armor before one is able to enchant them as
      normal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have yet to divine the exact reason for
      the incompatibility of elemental armors and magic. I can only speculate
      that there are greater magical forces at work, resulting from the
      intricacies of Lady Maila's craft, than I, a newcomer to this world, am
      able to fully comprehend. One would hope that in the future, I will be
      able to solve the mystery of Lady Maila's creation.</font></td>
