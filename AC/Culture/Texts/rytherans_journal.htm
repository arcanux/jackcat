    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It is at times like these that I most miss 
	the presence of my beloved Lady, the fairest light of the Eternal Court, my 
	helpmate and advisor in all important decisions since we first entered into 
	that agreement with His Eternal Splendor. Perhaps, my lost lady love, if we 
	had not been apart, you with your ageless eye and limitless wisdom would 
	have been able to see the flaws in this plan... I have not felt this afraid 
	and uncertain since the day when we stood together at Ayn Tayan, ready to 
	confront the Hopeslayer and the oblivion he represented. <br>
	<br>
	I used the book. It was not my idea, not at first. His Eternal Splendor 
	simply wished to visit unique and eternal torments upon the Mhoires and in 
	particular on that troublesome jester who served them. As a leader of the 
	Winds from Darkness, it seemed an irresistible opportunity to me, to grasp 
	true world-altering power and to feel it bend to my will. So I agreed to 
	open a single page of the Book of Eibhil and use the terrible power 
	contained with its maddening runes to inflict eternal torment upon the 
	enemies of my eternal King. I confess that I saw an opportunity to grasp 
	more power for myself, as well. I was so caught up in the possibilities, I 
	was blinded, as I rarely am, to the consequences. <br>
	<br>
	We, the First-Born of Dericost, are prideful in our age. We have lived as we 
	are, part of this world yet forever sundered from it, for ten thousand 
	years. We have watched the struggles of the Yalain and laughed at their 
	over-reaching, even as we mourned our own lands that fell to the insect 
	plague that they unleashed. We have sneered at the mortal minions of the 
	last Yalain even as our most treasured bastions surrendered their secrets to 
	these ubiquitous creatures. It may have been too long since we, the 
	First-Born, felt the humiliation of over-reaching and realized ourselves to 
	be but minor pieces in a game larger than we can comprehend. <br>
	<br>
	Even as my memories of Menilesh and my love for Aerfalle dwindle, the last 
	emotion that stirs my empty heart may be shame. Shame that I allowed myself 
	to be so duped by the Book, the Book that we knew to be derived from the 
	primal darkness that the Falatacot found so enthralling, the darkness which 
	eventually overcame them. So adept have I become at whispering destructive 
	temptation into the dreams of mortal fools that I did not recognize, until 
	too late, that I was fooled by the whispered blandishments of the Old Ones. 
	Because as I grasped the power that they offered through the Book, even so 
	was I snared in a trap far older than the First-Born. <br>
	<br>
	The use of the Book by such an unprepared and unhallowed hand as mine has 
	created a flaw. There is a new crack in the foundation, a new seam in the 
	fabric of creation. It will not arise now, or even in a thousand years, but 
	it will arise, when the conditions on this troubled island of Killiakta are 
	right. There will be a crack in the invisible lines through which flow the 
	Blood of the World that the primal chaos at the core of the world will 
	exploit. I will do my best to bury this graveyard of tormented Mhoires deep 
	in the ground, protected and concealed with all the wards at my disposal, to 
	conceal the flaw for as long as I can. But the servants of the Old Ones 
	always find a way. <br>
	<br>
	Some day the power that I brushed upon will be unleashed into the world. 
	Even as I plot to hide the evidence of my mistake, I must also make plans 
	for the future. I will take the Book of Eibhil out of my library and hide it 
	- so that only my eternal sovereign will be able to reach it. And I will 
	notify certain agents of mine that a time will come when the Blood of the 
	World will be spilled and all sensitives will war for control of its flow. I 
	must prepare them for the fight that is inevitable. They are good and loyal 
	servants, and deserving of a better master. </font></p>
