    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The Blood of the World flows 
    quickly beneath this land. Once, our ancestors in darkness, called upon the 
    blood by a name. Now we, an order outside the sway of any other call 
    directly to the blood, for the life that it is. It heeds our call like the 
    tree obeys the wind, and coalesces into beings that command an aspect of the 
    whole. <br>
    <br>
    Now, we place to parchment, instructions to s<span lang="en-us">i</span>phon 
    these beings from the essence of the Blood of the World, and set them to our 
    tasks, to our goals. Our desire is to punish those that took our people into 
    slavery, and created crime upon crime to charge them. <br>
    <br>
    We shall not fail. For it is the blood of the righteous. Our truths shall 
    purge the Yalaini from the world, and bring again the reign of the Gelid.
    <br>
    <br>
    Words of Warning <br>
    <br>
    There is a tenuous peace that exists with the disciples of the Blood of the 
    World and the constructers of the Great Work. We are brethren tied by life, 
    and essence, but we are enemies; thought a cult, whose meddling with the 
    powers of Geomancy, will prove the undoing of all that there is. <br>
    <br>
    They have likened us to the reign of the one that cannot be named. Having 
    listened to the whispers from the Blood itself, seeking to join with it, 
    rather than prove its master. <br>
    <br>
    Our ancient mothers, and fathers, sing from the blood, but their chorus is 
    one that beckons only to fools. For we have seen the dark folly that befalls 
    those that become thrall to the machination of the Blood. We are steeled 
    against its call, and choose to harness it, not to obey. <br>
    <br>
    We will pull from the blood, the essence of its parts, and go to the Throne 
    with bloody swords in hand, to rip the throat from the usurper, ending his 
    reign of deceit and cruelty and freeing the memory of our kin. <br>
    We have found, what alliance with them can bring, and now we are no more 
    that the dust, and bones, like our brother kin the Dericost. <br>
    <br>
    Take heed, that we have translated these words and writings with the 
    greatest of care, but even the scope of our great ancestors, the priestesses 
    of darkness, cannot fully be known even to those who hear the Blood of the 
    World sing. <br>
    <br>
    We know only what we know, and tread with due caution into the unknown. <br>
    <br>
    Blood of the World <br>
    (Taken from a Falatacot Tome) <br>
    <br>
    It sings; <br>
    can you not hear it, <br>
    in the brush, in the water, <br>
    in the seething boils of putrid earth flesh. <br>
    <br>
    It calls, <br>
    beckons that we sing it's praise <br>
    and call it forth to bubble o'er the earth <br>
    in heavy waves. <br>
    <br>
    The Blood of the World, given form. <br>
    <br>
    Blood of the World <br>
    (Disciple Translation) <br>
    Beneath the earth within the focal points established when our ancient 
    mothers and fathers tread in the shadow, thrust from their homes, the voice 
    of the Blood of the World called to them. There they erected pillars to 
    signify the voice that they heard. <br>
    <br>
    At these places hold an important key to the construction and support of the 
    minions, that will bring the Yalaini low. <br>
    <br>
    Our search for the remaining focal points has begun. Then the construction 
    of the collection devices will begin. <br>

    without caution, and mastery, the result will ultimately be complete and
