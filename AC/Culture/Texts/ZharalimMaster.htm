    Shortly after arriving at the tower, we established a small camp on the 
    hill. This provided us easy access between the tower and the bridge and some 
    modicum of comfort. The banderlings across the valley have grown interested 
    in our work here, but none of them are a serious threat to our efforts. <br>
    <br>
    The staircase surrounding the tower has fallen into disrepair, so our 
    efforts have been delayed. Yalik suggested casting ropes to the top of the 
    tower and scaling the walls. This is likely the approach we will take. <br>
    <br>

    We had made a make-shift set of stairs to ease the transportation of 
    supplies into the tower, though the drop from the top into the visible 
    region of the tower is still painful, especially for those with heavy packs.
    <br>
    <br>
    Shortly before gloaming, our three moles crossed the bridge to join us. <br>
    <br>
    I thought it odd as they were not part of the group assigned to investigate 
    the tower, but any information they had would be most welcome. <br>
    <br>
    Log Entry 3<br>
    <br>
    We have established an area similar to the tent outside in the upper levels 
    of the tower. Many of the doors on this level were locked or closed to us 
    initially, but the use of our ways opened the rooms for our comfort. The 
    lower areas of this tower are dank and smell of heavy mildew. <br>
    <br>
    This tower has not kept well, and moisture has leaked into the lower levels, 
    damaging many of the artifacts we sought to investigate. <br>

    One of our guards fell prey to a terrible injury this day. We had breached 
    the walls off to the side near the mid point of our descent. On the other 
    side there was a glowing shrine, much like those Festival Stones found 
    across the land. A small winged creature charged him as he neared the 
    obelisk and stung him. The area around the wound instantly gangrened. By the 
    end of the day his skin had blackened in several locations and he passed on 
    shortly there after. As it stands right now, I have no idea if he returned 
    to his lifestone. As a result of this, I have ordered that any of these 
    beasts be destroyed on the spot and that everyone remain wary. I also 
    ordered Yalik to remain in the top level of the tower. He is a bright lad, 
    but not well versed in combat yet. I do not wish to see another of my 
    command die. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Over the night, a madness took hold of nearly half of my command. While we 
    had reached the bottom floor, we lost it again due to the madness. The 
    shadows on the walls seem to move with their own life. Our foreman has 
    become unaccounted for as have Rheth Al'thok, Rayssid Ibn Alhath, and Tiyol 
    Ibn Yufaj-- our three Cult infiltrators. <br>
    <br>
    Log Entry 6<br>
    <br>
    I sent a small crew down several levels to assess the degree of madness in 
    our ranks. Only one returned and his report was most grave. Deposits of 
    living soot were discovered slithering across the floor, shadows reached out 
    and attacked as if they had a life of their own, and our trio of informants 
    were kneeling before the obelisk we discovered. The warrior reported they 
    were swathed in black and gold robes, akin to those the Raven Hand has been 
    known to wear. <br>
    <br>
    I know now what has happened. They have played us for fools. Feeding us lies 
    and deceit. The Order of the Raven Hand is a persuasive force indeed. <br>
    <br>
    Log Entry 7<br>
    <br>
    I have ordered an evacuation of those still sane. I have instructed my 
    apprentice, Yalik, to turn back any attempt to enter this tower without 
    permission. I do not believe any of us here are safe from the madness, and 
    so I know what must be done. <br>
    <br>
    I must make efforts to seal this tower and prevent those within from 
    escaping and those outside from getting in. <br>
    <br>
    Treachery and madness... the staple of the Raven Hand it seems.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
