    Yaral has assigned me as the foreman of our investigation, an honor that 
    demands I be responsible for all findings in this decrepit tower. Our 
    progress down the tower has been slow, meeting obstacles and fallen ceilings 
    as we travel. The upper levels seem fairly barren, though a few rooms 
    contain coffins and urns. <br>
    <br>
    The sarcophagi are layered in a soot of undetermined origin. Perhaps there 
    was a fire in the lower levels and the smoke found its way into these rooms. 
    I am as yet unsure. <br>

    We broke through the wall midway down the tower. Within there was a Festival 
    Stone-like shrine. In addition to this, we discovered an Altar to 
    Bael'zharon. Not anything terribly odd as other locations have been known to 
    house these, but something worthy of note. It was also here that one of the 
    warriors was struck down by a odd grey bug. Of course we quickly slew the 
    rest we found there after, but examination revealed nothing other than a 
    brittle exoskeleton. <br>

    Some of our progress has been hindered by ruins and rubble our means are 
    incapable of moving. In addition, there are cobwebs in this dungeon the 
    thickness of which I have never seen. We reached what appears to be the 
    bottom level of the tower. The central column of the inner tower is 
    surrounded by massive stone heads. <br>
    <br>
    In the rooms off to the side, shrines to Bael'zharon can be found. I am 
    beginning to worry about this project. <br>

    Several of my miners have fallen ill and have become crazed to a degree. I 
    have ordered them to be brought back to the upper levels to rest. The lowest 
    level remains baffling to us. Even our methods cannot breach the doors. 
    There must be a trigger we missed somewhere. There are some odd tapestries 
    hanging from the walls here. Gilded and finely woven, they display creatures 
    I am unfamiliar with and show what appears to be mages of some sort weaving 
    powerful spells. Our artisans have done their best to reconstruct the 
    tapestries upon their tablets. My anxiety about this room increases the 
    longer were are here. The shadows seem to loom over us and more and more of 
    us are stricken with illness the longer we wait and work here. <br>

    I am fortunate to have chosen the room I did to stay the night, as when I 
    awoke the remain<span lang="en-us">d</span>er of my crew had been driven 
    mad! They struggled against the door, attempting to get at me. I hope they 
    lose interest soon. During my imprisonment, I noticed our informants, 
    flanked by living shadows. So it seems the culprits have been found. I only 
    hope that I am not the sole survivor. Once the maddened ones lose interest, 
    I shall spring the lever in this room and make my attempt at escape. 
    Hopefully I will be able to reach Yaral to warn him of what has transpired.<br>
