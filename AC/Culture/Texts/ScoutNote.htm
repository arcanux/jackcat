    <font face="Arial" size="2">Upon entering the lair I was previously familiar with, it became immediately 
apparent that different varieties of Olthoi had infested the tunnels. These were 
more active and aggressive. I managed to work my way down to what had previously 
been the lowest levels. There, I discovered a portal leading to new and deeper 
catacombs. These were inhabited by even deadlier Olthoi than those above. An ill 
omen, to be sure, and worthy of the High Queen's attention. There is deadly 
purpose in all this activity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus, I was not completely surprised to find yet 
another portal at the bottom of these new catacombs. However, on the other side 
of the portal was a series of catacombs of older origin. It is possible they may 
be a central hive of some sort. When I eventually came upon a couple of other 
scouts that had survived this reconnaissance we had been tasked with, it was 
obvious that a number of Olthoi lairs are now linked to these catacombs. Most 
surprising of all was my discovery of a long-trapped group of Isparians. A 
hunting party had set forth to clear out Olthoi in other tunnels and a portal 
had lead them to these catacombs. Apparently an exit portal was available for a 
while,then it disappeared. Some of their acquaintances went to search for them, 
expecting to be able to exit, as before. They also became trapped. <br>
<br>
Since then, they survive as best they can, under primitive conditions. They 
became very adept at fighting the Olthoi. Fortunately some areas of these 
catacombs provide a natural environment somewhat more beneficial to human 
sustenance than Olthoi tunnels.<br>
<br>
Our arrival here may have been fortuitous- as evidenced in the lairs which lead 
us here the Olthoi are demonstrating purposeful activity and movement. Without 
some assistance their prospect for survival is tenuous at best Therefore I and 
the surviving scouts decided to stay and help keep the Olthoi at bay. Additional 
help may be necessary, should this threat grow, and it does appear to be 
growing. The Royal Guard should alert the Queen and all Isparians should be 
vigilant. The Olthoi may be on the move once more. </font></p>
