    <a href="../Dereth/Waking2.htm">Waking 
    From the Abyss</a> event (Dec. 24, 2003).<br>

          <div class="bodyTextMedium">
            <img src="../Dereth/Waking/68.jpg" align="right" border="3" width="226" height="356"><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira 
            was the last to arrive. She walked into the meeting hall and sat 
            opposite Celdiseth who met her gaze without fear. Elysa waited for 
            the room to settle and then called the room to order.</font><p>
            <font face="Arial" size="2">“For nearly the past two months I have 
            fought for my life. I have thanks to offer to all of you who spent 
            so much time in search of a remedy and cure for my ailment, and for 
            seeing to the safety of our home. I am grateful to all of you, for 
            everything that was done.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Murmurs of shared gratitude filtered 
            among the council. All were here: Lord Kresovus of the Linvak 
            Lugians, Aun Hareltah of the Aun Tumerok, the Archmages Celdiseth, 
            Fadsahil, Shoyanen and Nuhmudira, Ciandra the head of the Arcanum, 
            and Antius. All were here save Asheron. Elysa raised her hands to 
            quiet them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“While I struggled to live I realized 
            something about myself, about all of us. All who share Dereth. We 
            are a diverse people, whose backgrounds stretch from the arcane to 
            the mystical and to the physical. But in this room, we are all 
            leaders. We make decisions that are meant to be in the best interest 
            of the people who live in this world, our people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We mandate, discuss, bandy ideas and 
            trade information in this council. But we do not hear the will of 
            the people. We humans do not walk amongst our own as do the lugians 
            and tumeroks. I envy the positions of Lord Kresovus and Aun Hareltah. 
            They are leaders, in the sense that I wish to be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“One part of why I believe I have 
            failed to be this kind of leader is Lord Asheron. I have looked to 
            him for advice and guidance for several years, and during that time 
            I have come to rely upon him as an aged man would rely upon a cane. 
            No longer.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again the murmurs began. Nuhmudira 
            was silent but it was obvious to Antius that she was thinking of the 
            possibilities that were available to her with the elder mage 
            removed. Or perhaps it was the shock of knowing that Elysa had 
            spoken to Asheron. Antius was bothered by her lack of reaction. He 
            expected that she would give something away, anything that would be 
            a tell-tale sign that she had tried to imprison the mage on his 
            island. There was nothing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Asheron has agreed to leave his seat 
            upon this council. He has, like me, returned to his primary concern, 
            his people. I would ask…that Aun Hareltah and Lord Kresovus do the 
            same. I desire to hear the words and ideas of your peoples, but I 
            beg you not to succumb to the corruption of your ideals. You are 
            strong leaders who believe in me. Send ambassadors in your place. 
            They shall sit in your seats and speak in your voices.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa had spoken to them a week prior 
            to the council meeting. They were apprised of how the conversation 
            would flow and were not offended by the words. They were flattered 
            and had already chosen the names of their ambassadors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Linvak shall send Grevik Mar to 
            sit upon this council.” Lord Kresovus responded.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“My son shall sit upon your council 
            and speak in his father’s voice.” Aun Hareltah offered.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa nodded and continued. “Further, 
            I wish to restructure the remainder of the council. I would like to 
            ask Celdiseth to remain as Master of the Arm, Fadsahil as Master of 
            the Right Hand, Shoyanen as the Master of the Left hand and Ciandra 
            as the Master of the Heart. Antius will serve as my Seneschal and 
            should I be absent or otherwise indisposed he will speak with my 
            voice. Antius will also act as my chief ambassador to the Aun and 
            Linvak.” </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, the other members of the 
            council also knew of Elysa’s intentions. Only Nuhmudira was without 
            previous knowledge. She sat in silence, bordering it seemed on rage 
            or apathy. Antius could not read the woman.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Nuhmudira,” Elysa spoke plainly, 
            “you have served upon this council and as a councilor with the 
            Zaikhal mages for over a decade. You have served the people of 
            Dereth in a manner that I feel has been exemplary. You lead the 
            people against the Ancient Olthoi Queen, for that I am grateful…and 
            for that, I must ask that you step down from the council.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;“Your actions were rash, without 
            thought and without the unanimous support of your peers. While you 
            remain one of the strongest mages amongst the Isparians, you lied 
            openly to me and to this council. You did not visit Asheron with the 
            glands that were taken from the Olthoi. Where those glands went, I 
            do not know. I know that you lied, and duped myself, this council 
            and the people.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira remained stolid. She did 
            not blink. She stared Elysa down in a contest of wills it appeared. 
            Elysa met the old woman’s gaze with a steely glare of her own.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Were it not for your years of 
            service and the efforts that you made while with the Arcanum in 
            assuring the Isparians of shelter for years to come I would have 
            sought a punishment more befitting. But as it stands we still owe 
            you much.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We thank you for your service, 
            Nuhmudira. We wish you well in your future.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No one spoke. There were no polite 
            murmurs of thanks, only tension. Nuhmudira stared at Elysa, and 
            Elysa did not back down. A minute passed with the two locked in this 
            test of wills.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Nuhmudira, I will say this only once 
            more, and if you do not comply I will remove you from this room. You 
            will not approve of the method by which I banish you. We thank you 
            for your service, now leave.” Elysa’s voice took on a steel cold 
            edge that cut the tension in twain. Antius fiddled his peace knot 
            free and prepared to step between Elysa and Nuhmudira. But the 
            stalemate abated as Nuhmudira bowed her eyes and then her head.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I wish…” Nuhmudira began, “to say 
            only a few words before I depart, and then you will no longer need 
            to worry about the ‘Monster in the Labyrinth.’ I have always done my 
            best to serve the people of Dereth. I will continue to do so. I 
            have—for some time now, I have desired to retire from this…council, 
            to pursue the opportunity to educate the future generations of 
            Isparians. With your leave, High Queen, I wish to reserve the 
            ability to do so.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Aye, you can.” Elysa smiled. “I 
            would never restrict the goals and aspirations of any Isparian upon 
            Dereth.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira nodded. “Very good, very 
            good.” She rose. “I will see you in Arwic, perhaps. That is where I 
            shall build my school. Though it will take me much time to gather 
            the necessary materials.” She bowed her head, and smiled weakly. She 
            looked about the table one last time. “I wish you all—well.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Without a word, without the use of 
            casting element she was gone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No casting device.” Celdiseth said 
            between clenched teeth. “Not the first time, eh?”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa shook her head. “I have seen 
            her do such before.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Well lass, she’s definitely not like 
            us anymore. And I’d say she doesn’t much like us anymore, either.” 
            Celdiseth smiled. Antius released the grip on his sword.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new council began speaking and 
            burned two candles to their end, disbanding shortly before the 
            morning sun crested the horizon. Dereth was about to reawaken.</font></div>
