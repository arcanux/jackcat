    Grael was once a Spear of the Mukkir <br>
    He was a Blood-Warrior of Chief Daemal <br>
    His arm was the strongest of the Blood-Warriors <br>
    His beads of victory were many <br>
    He took many wives and many slaves <br>
    He fought at the Chief's left hand as they sang songs of rage <br>
    Grael failed Chief Daemal <br>
    The Shining Ones from the south attacked the Mukkir <br>
    Chief Daemal led the Blood-Warriors to battle <br>
    Grael was overwhelmed by sorcerous light <br>
    He failed to protect the back of his Chief <br>
    He saw his Chief fall, singing a song of rage <br>
    Grael became a prisoner of the Shining Ones <br>
    In their Great Circle, his war became their sport <br>
    Every day, he raged for the fall of his Chief <br>
    He slew all who came before him <br>
    He took their heads and ate their hearts <br>
    Every night, among the slaves, he sang songs of rage <br>
    Grael took his vengeance upon the Shining Ones <br>
    He took their slaves as his Blood-Warriors <br>
    His Blood-Warriors killed thousands who came for sport <br>
    The blood of the Shining Ones flooded their Great Circle <br>
    Grael ate the hearts of his slave-takers <br>
    He offered heads to the shade of his chief as he sang songs of rage <br>
    Grael fought three days against the Shining Ones <br>
    The streets of their city choked on blood <br>
    Slaves fought Shining Ones everywhere <br>
    The Shining Ones were many and fought with sorcery <br>
    The slaves were few and had no sorcery <br>
    The slaves fell and Grael fled, singing songs of rage <br>
    Grael sought Darkness to fight the Shining Ones <br>
    He swore oaths with the Dark that speaks <br>
    He spilled blood for the Dark that drinks <br>
    He learned to move within the Dark that walks <br>
    He learned to devour the light of the Shining Ones <br>
    Asleep in the whispering Darkness, he dreams songs of rage<br>
