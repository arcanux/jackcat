    Lightning parted the clouds and a crack of thunder caused the room to 
    shudder. Antius looked to Borelean. The boy was unfazed; he sat, staring 
    into the fire, with the same look he had worn for over a month. He was 
    acting the part of a soon-to-be-King, not allowing his mother’s labored 
    breathing to break his will. Antius knew she had taught him to be like this, 
    to hide his emotions and not give an inch to the world.<br>
    <br>
    It had only been a few months, eight to be exact, since Elysa and Antius had 
    become lovers. It was no great surprise to the boy, nor was it a surprise to 
    Asheron. Others on the Council had been wary. Antius was an unknown. His 
    efforts across Dereth had only started to be recognized within the past two 
    years. He was sometimes clumsy with his words and often overzealous in his 
    endeavors. Many marked him as a passing fancy. None had expected him to 
    become Seneschal.<br>
    <br>
    He would not be King. The prospect of being given such a lofty title left 
    him sour. His roots were in exploration and discovery; there was no need to 
    soil his life with the unwanted adoration or scrutiny of the masses. 
    Instead, he joined the Council as chief diplomat, an area that all other 
    members agreed he excelled in, and the rumors of his affair with Elysa were 
    tempered. Many of the discoveries of the past eight months were either his 
    directly or were directed by his hand. He never wanted glory, only 
    scholarship. Now, all he wanted was for Elysa to wake up.<br>
    <br>
    Borelean heard a thin raspy whistle emanate from his mother and turned 
    toward her stoically, “Antius? If she passes, will the Maidens take her?”<br>
    <br>
    Antius looked into the fire and searched for words that would console the 
    boy, but he knew consolation was not what the boy wanted—so much like his 
    mother. He cleared his throat and placed a hand on Borelean’s shoulder, “If 
    the Maidens can reach their hands to this world, they will take your mother 
    back to Ispar, and she will sup with Pwyll at a great hero’s feast.” The boy 
    nodded. Antius squeezed his shoulder gently and looked toward Elysa. They 
    each allowed their gaze to fix upon her for a moment.<br>
    <br>
    The firelight danced over her motionless form, shadows caressed her cheeks 
    and hid within the folds of her blanket, emerging with each new flicker of 
    the flames. The gentle heave of her chest continued despite the poison that 
    coursed through her veins, though she sometimes strained, she still 
    breathed. Antius suspected who the assassin had been, but there was little 
    that he could do at the moment. Not now. Nuhmudira had seen to the 
    destruction, or at least the repulsion, of the Ancient Olthoi Queen from 
    Knorr, but she had disappeared immediately after. Jenavere and Hendac had 
    reported that the Olthoi Queen was routed, but not gone. They had also 
    reported the arrival of cadres of Undead in her wake. <br>
    <br>
    He had dispatched the pair to investigate newly discovered tunnels earlier 
    this very day, and the weather had turned to a bitter chill. The air was 
    crisp and the clouds dark and as the first sign of winter’s wrath closed in 
    about them he had asked Borelean to sit with him and his mother this 
    evening. It was commonplace now. He had asked the same question for each of 
    the past nights for more than a month. The pair looked back to the fire, and 
    a chill wind crept through the slats of the winter shutters. Rain and hail 
    began to pelt the stonework outside.<br>
    <br>
    The heavens roared again and Elysa sat upright in bed. Antius and Borelean 
    looked toward her, staring in disbelief. Her eyes were wide open, and her 
    labored breathing was replaced with a frantic panting. Honey-gold hair 
    matted against her forehead as beads of cold sweat pooled along the furrows 
    of her brow. Her right hand clutched her shift tightly at the chest, where 
    the assassin’s blade had torn through her flesh. She looked toward the fire 
    and saw Borelean and Antius staring at her in awe. She smiled gently, and 
    beckoned them to her. As thunder rumbled behind a dark curtain of storm 
    clouds, tears fell in the chambers of the High Queen.<br>
