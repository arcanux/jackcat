    City of Frore during the Sudden Season event.</em> </font></small><p><font face="Arial"><small>The
    Expedition of <br>
    Sir Joffre Tremblant, of Rithwic, <br>
    and his Fellowship, <br>
    Yarick Pathwarden, <br>
    Palomar Ben-Cabalah, <br>
    Ion Lundgren, <br>
    Fidisa the Agile, <br>
    and Luma Homini, <br>
    in search of the legendary city of <br>
    Frore, <br>
    as recorded by <br>
    Yarick Pathwarden. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 1 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We have finally encountered the ice caves in which the city
    of Frore is rumored to be hallowed. It is colder than a Tumerok's heart in here! Fidisa
    managed to pick the lock of the door near the cavern mouth, and with the rope from my
    pack, we all rappelled down the sheer drop-off afterwards. The Gelidites did indeed go to
    great lengths to protect their privacy! And the walls, embedded with brilliant blue
    crystals, give off an eerie glow as if they possessed an energy all their own. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>There are many tunnels to explore, we will bear rightward
    according to Palomar's divinations. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 2 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We have wandered the tunnels for more than a day and found
    little but frozen waste. At the lower depths the cold becomes unbearable - we rest now
    shrouded in the warmth of the Cold Protection spells Palomar has cast. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 3 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The tunnels are a confusing series of interconnected
    switchbacks even my enhanced intuition cannot make heads or tails of. Perhaps the piercing
    cold is ruining our concentration. Some areas are warmer than others, we will stick to
    them to preserve energy. Still no signs of civilization, although we have witnessed
    disturbing signs of life: noises that seem to come from within the walls themselves,
    flickers of movement that shadow us every now and then, and the chamber in which we now
    make camp - a disturbing hollow furnished only with human skulls. We are wary of resting
    here, but Sir Joffre assures us that whatever caused this carnage has long since passed
    away. I am not so sure.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 4 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We have happened upon a construction that can only have been
    made by the hands of men - or something greater. A symmetrical arrangement of large
    stones, perfectly shaped. Could this be the entrance to their lost civilization? There is
    more to explore downward but it is colder there. We will make camp to recoup before
    probing further. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 5 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>They came for us, swarms of them, while we were in camp. It
    was as if they were waiting for us to let down our guard. Hideous reincarnations of the
    dead, their ghastly visages reflected their single lust - our deaths. We dispatched them,
    but Fidisa caught a mortal blow during the melee, and the hideous creatures dragged her
    corpse away before we could act. These monoliths will serve as grim markers of the place
    of her demise. We press deeper into the caves, shaken but still vigilant in our mission. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 6 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I have never experienced such a bone chilling cold before
    this day. Or night? I have lost track of time in these damned caverns. The frosted
    passages ended in a carved stone hallway, which is a most encouraging sign. Perhaps we are
    close to discovering the city! </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The dead continue to besiege us. Sir Joffre, in his valor,
    has been injured but Luma's healing skills seem to have brought the wound under control.
    Palomar is growing weak, and his magical supplies are dwindling. I don't know how much
    longer he can maintain our protection from the cold. Moments ago the magic fizzled thrice
    in a row before finally providing us with heat sufficient to brave these depths. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 7 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>What a wonder to behold! We have made our way to what can
    only be the object of our quest, it appears to be the entrance to a ruined city! Toppled
    walls and debris are testament to the existence of a once thriving metropolis buried far,
    far below the ice. There are no signs of life here, but I don't know whether to be
    disturbed or relieved. We have only scratched the surface - amidst the few ruined
    structures that lie here we have discovered a locked gate - what lies beyond can only be
    what we have been searching for! There is another arrangement of stones here, which seems
    to radiate a powerful energy. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Palomar warns us of the peril that may lie beyond, but we are
    all in agreement that there is plenty of peril where we stand. There is still much to
    explore in the surrounding area, so we shall regroup before attempting to find a way
    beyond the gate. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 8 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Oh what horrible fate has found us here! We were startled by
    a roar from a pack of undead that seemed to appear from nowhere - I feel we have disturbed
    the spirits of these caves and they unleashed upon us their fury in the form of these
    shambling corpses. We fought valiantly but Luma, our healer, was rent asunder by the
    beasts' bony fingers, and we were unable to best them. Again, the dead swept her mortal
    remains away. I am chilled by this behavior, the way they steal our companions' bleeding
    forms away from us. I do not believe I shall sleep soundly again, until I see our
    companions safely resurrected at the Lifestone in Arwic. At least our departed comrades
    will be able to tell the world what we have found here! </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>But lo, that is not the worst of terrors in this forsaken
    place! We fled towards the gate only to be confronted by the three magical guardians of
    Gelidite legend - Fenngar, Frisander, and Ferundi! They had long since breathed their
    last, and their grotesque incarnations removed all desire for us to pass through that
    gate. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>With one swing of Fenngar's mighty warhammer, our leader Sir
    Joffre was smashed to bits. Frisander unleashed upon us a volley of frost, the intensity
    of which no living mage could ever hope to reproduce. We watched in horror while Ferundi
    pointed his decayed finger at Palomar and sucked the life out of him swith such violence
    that Palomar's desiccated flesh literally exploded off of his body. With Palomar went our
    last hope to resist the bitter cold. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Ion and I beat as hasty a retreat as we could, our numbing
    legs carrying us back away from the gate and past the great frost monster. As our
    protection from the bone-chilling air waned, Ion and I fled the accursed city to find the
    warmth of the upper caves. We now rest briefly before beginning to make our way out of
    here. We regret most that we could not even attempt to retrieve Sir Joffre's body - a most
    unholy burial he shall have! </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 9 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>There is not much time for writing, as we must keep moving to
    stay warm. The dead assault us in droves - Ion is wounded in his left arm and can no
    longer draw his bow, fighting instead with a mace. I fear my sword will soon shatter to
    bits in this frigid air. My fingers will be sure to follow. How we long to see the sun
    again soon. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 10 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Cannot find the egress. Best guesses as to its whereabouts
    all wrong. Accursed tunnels, we are lost! I grow sleepy. Soon Ion shall have to carry me
    out of here ... </small></font><em></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The remainder of the journal was found on the corpse of Ion
    Lundgren.</small></font></em></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 13 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It has been three days since we fled the forsaken gates of
    Frore - may it remain buried forever! - and I fear there is no end to these twisting
    tunnels. I marvel that my hand still has feeling enough to pen these words, as my feet
    have long since gone numb. It won't be much longer before I succumb to the cold as the
    others did before me. Yarick kept the journal before me - he clutches half of it still in
    his cold hands, the other half lost in our flight. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I write this last page as I cease my search for the egress.
    But I must keep moving if I am to stay warm ... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 14 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>By some black miracle, I found our point of entry. The rope
    we used to climb down from the tunnel above was coiled on the floor of the pit, its upper
    end showing the mark of a cruel knife. They will not let me leave - knowing the tunnels as
    well as they do, they must have cut it days ago. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It is a cruel, maddening fate to be trapped in these caves,
    endlessly fleeing the fearsome denizens within; a crueler fate still knowing that I when I
    breathe my last here, I shall not return to the sunny common of Arwic, the lifestone I
    visited weeks ago. None shall learn our tale without being plunged themselves into the
    nightmare. What I saw yestereve... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Do not venture to rouse those who were meant to lay in peace.
    </small></font></p>
