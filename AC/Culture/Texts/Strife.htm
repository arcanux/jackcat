    <br>
    Unlike their stagnant brethren, the Disciples of Strife were a fragmented 
    and loose coalition of intelligent beings. They spent their time within the 
    very fire of volcanoes and studied the effect of the Blood of the World on 
    their magical arts. Their fractious nature left very little room for deep 
    study, or so it appears. The only remnant that I was able to collect from 
    their halls in regards to their involvement with the calling of this being 
    from the depths of the world was the canon that they followed. <br>
    <span lang="en-us">s</span><br>
    Oddly, this Canon was well composed and much more rigid than those of their 
    brethren. <br>
    <br>
    When I unleashed my wrath upon these foes, I was unable to torture the truth 
    from any of them. They were too used to the flames to be affected by the 
    methods of persuasion at my command. Likewise it appears that any of my 
    spies that attempted to infiltrate their ranks were either dismissed or 
    simply could not survive within the order. <br>
    <br>
    My generals were candid with me in explaining that some of these Disciples 
    escaped their grasp. Worse they were able to abscond with a most important 
    relic. The purpose of the relic was two fold. One, it was a navigational 
    beacon that could be affixed to my citadel. Two, it was a device that could 
    create an impenetrable field around the citadel proper. While within the 
    bounds of this device the citadel would become impassible to any being with 
    Yalain blood. Misfortunes do happen. <br>
    <br>
    Misfortunes, odd how they compound. One moment you are within striking 
    distance of you foe, the next at his mercy. It is true in this instance. We 
    were close, so very close to regaining the seat of this world. If the 
    Disciples of Strife had been less formidable we would have claimed the relic 
    and learned more of what they intended. But they were prepared, waiting, and 
    they had found a way to escape and to shield themselves from discovery. <br>
    <br>
    We were lax. We shall never be again. <br>
    <br>
    Code of Strife <br>
    <br>
    We are the purveyors of all that consumes in the holy fires of the world.
    <br>
    We are wrath. <br>
    We are fury. <br>
    We are hate. <br>
    We are the embodiment of revenge. <br>
    We are the ember that burns within the eye of rage. <br>
    We are they who calm the storm to unleash the balefire on the world. <br>
    We are the living beings given to Strife. <br>
    <br>
    In the fires that burn beneath the mountains of the world we shall make our 
    home. There we will become one with the flame and allow it to nurture our 
    flesh as it burns away our impurity. In the heat we shall swelter and forge 
    our minds solid. <br>
    <br>
    In the burning we shall take our seat and dwell among the magma. There we 
    shall call upon the Blood to take its form among us. We shall work flame 
    into reality, and then control it with the Minister's devices. <br>
    <br>
    A flood of molten fury shall be set upon the world. We shall be the masters. 
    The Blood of the World shall be turned against the Yalain, and we shall be 
    the spearheads of the forces, the strength of the armies that will march 
    across the land. We shall be the forward charge of Strife and the Champion, 
    Warrior and Magi of the flame. The Blood shall call to us, in ways that no 
    other shall comprehend. <br>
    <br>
    When the One is drawn forth from the blood of the four it is we who shall be 
    there to beckon it along and give it direction. Then in new forms of 
    elemental fury we shall march side by side and cleanse this world with 
    purging fire leaving nothing but ash in our wake. In our cistern there shall 
    be flame and the charred remains of those that oppose us will fuel the 
    furnaces of the world forever more. <br>
    <br>
    Rise now and serve with me, be the blood that boils beneath the crust of 
    this world. Join with the blood and stand inside the perfect wrath. <br>
    <br>
    We are the forward guard the glory and the divine holy flame that purges the 
    wicked before us. <br>
    <br>
    (Translator Note: The first voice returns here.) <br>
    <br>
    Summation <br>
    <br>
    Fanatical. Sadly they did desert us. They are to be hunted with impunity. 
    Destroy them where you find them and show no remorse in silencing their 
    voices forever. If we find their hidden location it will quicken or 
    resurgence that much quicker.</font></small></td>
