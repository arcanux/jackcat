      <br>
      Dereth's seasons are beautiful, whether it be deep winter, when the snows 
      blanket the countryside, or in plush spring, when the trees are blossoming 
      and the grass is a deep verdant green. However, it seems that while the 
      seasons change, the fauna does not. At least not until now. <br>
      <br>
      Recently, during my scouting of Dereth, I noticed some of the newly 
      arrived fauna finally adapting to the Derethian seasons. This has lead to 
      me publishing this book, in the hopes that it will help other fellow poac...Err, 
      hunters like myself. <br>
      <br>
      Shreths: Shreths have been on Dereth for a long time, and are only now 
      beginning to exhibit some signs of finally adapting to the shifting 
      seasons. Recently, their hides have begun to thicken, resulting in the 
      occasional shreth hide, which is useful in making armor for your hands and 
      feet. If a large enough hide could be found, it is possible you could even 
      make pants out of it. Bring whatever you find to your local leather 
      crafter. I'm certain he can do something with it. <br>
      <br>
      Sclavus: These upright canvas bags are great sources of new shoes, coats, 
      and the occasional head gear, if you're into that. I guess that it's 
      molting season for these nasty creatures, and they are more ornery than 
      normal, so be careful if you see one. <br>
      <br>
      Ursuins: At the beginning of the winter I released a book about how fast 
      the Ursuin adapted to the environment. Well, the fact is, that was an 
      understatement. Now they've gone and adapted to the summer too! Their 
      coats are all soft and wonderful now, and even better for skinning, if not 
      as padded as the winter ones were. Hope they don't keep going at this 
      rate. Soon they'll stand on their back legs and start asking for a Portal 
      to Teth with the rest of us! <br>
      <br>
      Well, that's all for now. I'll keep you updated if anything else changes 
      amongst the flora and fauna of Dereth.<br>
