    </font><font face="Arial" size="2">I love to draw and for this reason she 
    will never love me. I favor the sketching of designs over the heft of a 
    blade. Thus, she will not love me.<br>
    <br>
    We were but children when we were called to Dereth. Do you not know that I 
    came here for you, Astara? We were in the field near our families on a 
    cloudy day. The portal appeared, bathing us in purple light. You stared in 
    fascination at this magical apparition, and then approached it. I felt 
    nothing but fear for you, I was not drawn to it, yet I ran towards you to 
    pull you away. You vanished suddenly and with a cry I jumped in after you. I 
    could hear our parent's cries fading behind me as if smothered by a down 
    blanket. Fortunately for us, they followed soon after.<br>
    <br>
    I came through portal space to this world for you. And you will not return 
    my love.<br>
    <br>
    I am not sure when I first began loving you, Astara. We had been friends for 
    years as children on Ispar, though your family was wealthier than mine. We 
    remained friends here on this new, rough-hewn world. As we grew older, I 
    began noticing your eyes, the way your lips moved when you spoke. The smell 
    of your hair. They say love is of the heart, but why is it whenever you are 
    close my stomach jumps like it is filled with all the rabbits that dwell 
    around Rithwic? Yet, I could never tell you.<br>
    <br>
    They say I can do naught but draw. Perhaps it is true.<br>
    <br>
    I cannot seem to do other things to people's satisfaction, though I try. 
    Yet, when I put quill to parchment I am able to create buildings of fancy, 
    whole worlds that I would escape to. On Ispar this skill could have been 
    useful, I could have been an artisan of<br>
    buildings. Fate has denied me this. This world values not such a skill.<br>
    <br>
    I see how you watch Delton as he practices his swordplay on the outskirts of 
    Rithwic. Swift of blade he is, while I am merely deft of pen. He cuts arcs 
    through the air while I trace the arcs of imaginary structures on scraps of 
    parchment. Sitting on the bench, I watch you watching him. I show you my 
    sketch, you glance at it, smile and turn back to observing Delton's thrusts 
    and parries. His blade whistles as it cuts the air. Your attention towards 
    him slices my heart. I will lose you.<br>
    <br>
    A wandering scribe came to our cottage one day. I was pleased that he had 
    some bright, clean parchment which he was willing to part with in exchange 
    for my cleaning his soiled boots. He recited stories of his travels; I 
    showed him my sketches of buildings I wished to construct someday. When I 
    showed him my favorite one, a mighty, multi-spired stone tower climbing to 
    the heavens, he paused and looked at me. He reached into his pack and pulled 
    out a sheaf of paper. Thumbing through it, he found what he was looking for. 
    It was an ancient, torn parchment, Empyrean in origin he said it was. It 
    appeared to be a diagram of a tall, vertical structure with floating spires. 
    It was so much like my favorite design! He said he had intended to have this 
    studied but thought it a fitting present to me. <br>
    <br>
    I showed it to you the next day. You examined both the ancient diagram, and 
    mine, and held my hand for a moment, your touch electric. You smiled and 
    said, &quot;That is so interesting. Perhaps you will build like an Empyrean!&quot; My 
    heart pounded, I could see you finally understood! Yes, those wonders that 
    we cannot build, those are what I strive for! I draw that which can only be 
    imagined now! You had to go then, but for the remainder of that day my 
    happiness knew no bounds.<br>
    <br>
    The following day was sunny and I spotted you sitting prettily on the bench 
    in the square. I sat down by you, we talked of nothing in particular, my 
    head swimming the entire time with the thought that I should take hold of 
    your hand. Perhaps kiss your cheek. I came so close to reaching out... but 
    could not. Instead, I took out parchment and began to draw. Delton Hardor 
    came by and went to his usual spot for practicing swordplay. I saw how you 
    looked at him...<br>
    <br>
    I knew I must prove myself to you. Regain your attention.<br>
    <br>
    I challenged Delton to a match. You appeared surprised as I stood and 
    approached him. I could feel your eyes on me. Then Delton's attitude, as 
    always, turned dismissive. He tossed me a wooden sword. Grinning, he took a 
    haughty stance. I think I surprised you both by lunging quickly. I then went 
    for his legs. He deflected my blows. I did not mind his counterblows to my 
    body. His derisive laughter I could not countenance. The rage I felt at this 
    was something that must have been building within for some time. I went at 
    him, flailing like mad. To no avail, for he was able counter all my blows, 
    raining down his all the same. I could hear you screaming, Astara, for him 
    to stop, for me to stop. Finally, I fell to the ground. Your screams at me 
    for my mad behavior pained me far worse than the bruises I received. I had 
    stooped to Delton's level of trying to impress you. I had failed at this, as 
    in most things. I shrugged off your concern and stalked away.<br>
    <br>
    Yet, I knew I must prove myself to you. Somehow.<br>
    <br>
    I resolved to find the Tower. Telling no one, I made plans, gathered my 
    things. I had never been far from Rithwic- this adventure would certainly 
    endear me to you! Finding this spired structure you had seemed impressed 
    with would certainly be an accomplishment worthy of any bold explorer. I had 
    to start by journeying to Lin. The first few days were hardest... but I will 
    not bother to go into all the details of my Journey.<br>
    <br>
    Did you even know I had left?<br>
    <br>
    When I arrived in Lin, Tian Li was kind enough to put me up and tell me 
    where I could research this structure. I was able to discover that the 
    Empyrean who did this sketch was named Saolor Lentain. I found evidence of 
    an archive southwest of the Dungeon of Tatters. The archive was attributed 
    to having been built by Saolor Lentain. I go there now. I will leave this 
    journal with Tian Li. He could give give it to you, Astara, should you come 
    searching for me.<br>
