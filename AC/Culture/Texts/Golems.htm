			<font color="#FFFFFF">In the volcanic half-light within Mount Lethe, 
			the stones began to move. A few, glowing like clumps of embers, 
			trembled and clattered across the floor. Then larger pieces began to 
			stir, twisting and swirling upwards like leaves in an autumn zephyr. 
			The blackened pieces of basalt slowly assumed a hulking shape -- a 
			purpose. 
			<p>“Golem!” a female voice called, from down the corridor. </p>
			Vaguely humanoid in form, the shifting stones pounded down the magma 
			tube, throwing their deep red ember-light on the walls, and on two 
			small figures bathed in sweat and soot. “Hendac!” the woman called, 
			hurling a smoky gray nabut to her companion. As it sailed through 
			the scorching heat, its trail of frost melted to a rain that sizzled 
			and steamed on the charred rocks. The man, Hendac the Watcher, 
			caught the weapon handily, spinning it into a classic Aluvian 
			quarterstaff guard position. &nbsp; 
			<p>The Golem drew back and launched a fist of churning black gravel 
			at the woman. She sidestepped and flinched away from its broiling 
			mass. The near miss bathed her in bloody light. Her companion swept 
			in behind the Golem, striking again and again, to little effect. </p>
			<p>Frantically, the man snapped his fingers, then hand-signed to his 
			companion, Jenavere. She nodded, and they both sprinted back up the 
			magma tube. The Golem thundered down the corridor behind them, gouts 
			of flame erupting between its component stones. </p>
			They led it to one of the swinging rope bridges erected by Lord 
			Cambarth when he had attempted to mine the mountain. There, Hendac 
			spun and faced down the beast, striking it ineffectually as Jena 
			circled around behind it. The golem, angered, moved to the edge of 
			the bridge to smash him. 
			<p>Hendac ducked, and swing at the rocks that passed for legs. Jena 
			charged and shoved it from behind, yelping in pain as her hands 
			struck its semi-molten form. In a long stream of stones and gravel, 
			it tumbled over the low hemp railing, hitting the bubbling magma 
			below with a series of thick plops. </p>
			“Dumb as a pile of rocks,” Jenavere panted, wincing as Hendac 
			wrapped her blistered hands in a clean strip of cloth. “Thanks be to 
			the Poet.” The Golem stared up at them, flame belching from its eyes 
			and mouth, and roared. 
			<p>He motioned for her to follow him, and walked into the cavern at 
			the far end of the bridge, away from the suffocating heat wafting up 
			from the magma pools below. She followed, taking a last, thoughtful 
			look at the Golem splashing in the lava. </p>
			Hendac sat in the center of the cavern, and shrugged out of his 
			backpack. She sat across from him and placed her throbbing hands, 
			palms up, on her knees. He pulled a small wand and a few reagents 
			out of the pack. “What are you doing?” she asked. He glanced up, and 
			gestured with the wand at her hands. “Ah.” He had taken up the study 
			of life magic lately, and seemed to be intending a healing spell.<p>
			As he puttered, she looked back at the bridge, which swayed gently 
			in the hot air rising from the magma. “Hendac?” she asked. “What do 
			you know about Golems?” </p>
			He looked up with a smile. She returned it, having come to recognize 
			the subtle gleam in his eye; this was evidently one of the many 
			topics he had been collecting stories about. He set aside the wand, 
			dug into his pack again, and pulled out a battered journal. He 
			flipped through it a moment, then laid it open across her lap. The 
			pages were filled with notes, in elegantly scripted Roulean. 

			<p>“You know,&quot; she said, &quot;in our lands, there are men and women who 
			devote their entire lives to making their words a thing of beauty to 
			the eye as well as the ear. Some work for decades to produce a 
			single manuscript of the <i>Alamakhaida</i>.” Hendac shrugged 
			noncommittally. </p>
			“I only say,” she continued, “because you have the skill of one of 
			them.” At that, his soot-smudged cheeks showed a blush. His finger 
			traced in the dirt, “Do a lot of writing.”
			<p>She laughed fondly at his discomfort, and began to read as he 
			went about preparing his healing spell. </p>
			_____________ 
			<p>Golems are magically animated “clumps” of material. They are 
			found in greater variety than any other creature in Dereth. Examples 
			have been reported of mud, water, wood, limestone, sandstone, 
			copper, granite, iron, obsidian, and, of course, magma. </p>
			Celcynd of Rithwic claims to have seen one of another type. He told 
			me once that he had managed to swim through the strong sea-currents 
			to reach the island off the coast of Eastham. He found a large 
			castle there, of the same High Empyrean design as Neydisa near Mount 
			Esper, which is commonly held to date from the Age of Lore. The 
			gates to this island castle were guarded by Golems made of clear 
			gemstone. The light caught within their bodies refracted into 
			rainbows -- quite lovely, he said. They promptly sent him back to 
			the Lifestone. 
			<p>However, inebriated as usual, he also claimed a family of 
			Tremendous Monougas lived under the Obsidian Span, demanding a toll 
			from all who would cross. The account of the Golem may be merely 
			another drunken exaggeration. No one else has managed to swim to 
			this island, and the so-called “Diamond Golem” has never been 
			reported by any reliable source. </p>
			The sages have had many heated discussions about the Empyrean use of 
			Golems. While it is unlikely that anything short of an explanation 
			from Asheron himself will settle the issue, one theory seems to have 
			gained grudging acceptance by all schools of thought. That is the 
			“agent” thesis. This holds that the Empyrean used Golems as simple, 
			expendable laborers. 
			<p>A good deal of documentary evidence supports this. Recently 
			recovered texts, dating from the last war with the Shadows, detail 
			the use of Magma Golems as guardians and workers in Empyrean pyreal 
			forges. These forges seem to have been built solely within the heart 
			of active volcanoes. Mount Esper, in the north of Osteth, was at one 
			time such a foundry. (There is some scant evidence that Neydisa 
			Castle was used as a treasury for new pyreal.) It seems clear that 
			the Magma Golem was needed to work the metal -- sometimes within its 
			own semi-molten form, sometimes in liquid lava. </p>
			Other recovered texts, more obscure in source, mention that the 
			creation of Mud Golems was a frequent activity of Empyrean juveniles 
			-- their equivalent of making mud pies. Mud Golems would be used for 
			large-scale games of “toy soldiers,” or for help with chores (though 
			probably not cleaning). Perhaps these simple anecdotes alone serve 
			to emphasize the enormous gap between the knowledge of the ancient 
			Empyrean and our own cultures. The average child of Yalain could 
			create creatures beyond the ability of our most learned mages. 
			<p>Other known uses of Golems are legion. Golems have been found in 
			ancient mines, kitchens, and storehouses, doing menial and difficult 
			labor that the Empyrean apparently considered beneath them. Judging 
			by the singular scratches on the stonework, it seems that Golem 
			labor was used to help construct the great lighthouse near Tou-Tou. 
			Golems do not appear to have been used as soldiers, possibly because 
			of their susceptibility to a mass disenchantment spell that the 
			Empyrean are known to have possessed. Most often, Golems appear as 
			simple guardians, keeping visitors clear of areas considered 
			dangerous. It is curious that Golems often resort to aggressive 
			behavior -- perhaps a symptom of decay in their vital enchantments, 
			a kind of senility, if you will. </p>
			<p>The wide variety of Golem materials simply reflects the diversity 
			of environments in which they were created. Empyrean enchanters 
			apparently made use of the tools at hand. Thus Granite Golems tend 
			to appear in the Linvak and Lost Wish mountains, Sandstone Golems in 
			the A'mun desert, Wood Golems in the Tiofor Woods, and so forth. 
			Further, there is some indication that when a Golem's enchantment 
			begins to ebb low, it will return to the place in which it “feels 
			most at home.” For example, Mud Golems seek out swampy areas, and 
			Limestone Golems will return to caverns. </p>
			<p>Destruction of vast numbers of Golems has revealed very little 
			about their method of creation. Over ninety percent of their mass is 
			undifferentiated, inert material. Only two Golem “organs,” if such a 
			term may be used, seem to exist. The first of these is the Golem 
			Heart. This appears to be a core enchanted object, around which the 
			rest of the creature is assembled. The second organ is the mote of 
			magically forged pyreal alloy. While intact pyreal motes have only 
			recently been recovered, I have little doubt that they have existed 
			all along. Gondibyr Langarl, the archmage of Rithwic, believes that 
			these motes may have been what passed for a mind in the creature. 
			Instructions the Golem was expected to carry out were magically 
			imprinted upon the pyreal mote. </p>
			It seems likely that, in addition to taking commands directly from 
			an enchanter, Golems were designed to absorb instructions from 
			enchanted items and places. The basis for this theory (championed by 
			Shikiru Nohon of Hebian-to) lies in the numerous Golem “shrines” 
			scattered across Dereth, often in remote locations. These “shrines” 
			can appear as anything from simple standing stones to statuary. 
			Golems cluster around these artifacts expectantly, as if awaiting 
			orders. 
			<p>Perhaps these “shrines” once contained instructions, in the form 
			of pattern enchantments? Surely the small mote that serves as a 
			Golem's mind can only hold a finite set of instructions. Is it not 
			logical, argues Shikiru, that these shrines could be enchanted with 
			more elaborate series of commands? When a Golem completed one task, 
			it returned to the shrine for another. When the enchantments on the 
			shrines expired, the Golems were bereft of direction. Yet, after all 
			these centuries, they still patiently stand, awaiting orders. </p>
			<p>As a final rumination, it is interesting to note that most Golems 
			appear to have eyes and a mouth. These are often quite obvious. 
			Possibly the most striking Golem visage is that of the Wood Golem. 
			This entity resembles the classic daemon-tree Aluvian mothers use in 
			stories to keep children from wandering too far into the trackless 
			woods. However, one need only look at the shimmering, featureless 
			form of the Water Golem to prove that these are merely decorative. 
			The eyeless Water Golem can track its victims well enough. It seems 
			clear that these features are merely there for the comfort (or 
			perhaps discomfort) of the humanoid creatures that once interacted 
			with them. </p>
			Unfortunately, the secrets of Empyrean Demiurgy, or Golem 
			enchantment, continue to evade discovery. Perhaps one day, the 
			people of Ispar will learn this art for themselves. I do wonder, 
			however, what the result would be. With servants that can be made to 
			do the vilest, most dangerous work, would we grow decadent? Or would 
			these creatures serve to free us for the higher, finer pursuits of 
			art and learning, as they did the Empyrean? 
			<p>__________ </p>
			Golems are said to be remnants of Empyrean magic, left behind as 
			guardians for their strongholds, both above and below ground. Now 
			that the Empyrean have vanished, however, they have become mindless 
			automatons, attacking anything that comes near. They stand seven to 
			eight feet tall, and are made of many materials, including earth, 
			wood, water, ice, stone and metal. They bash with their club-like 
			limbs, and some also attack with magic.
