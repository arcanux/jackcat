    <td valign="top" width="441"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>by Allan Maki,
      Turbine Entertainment Software<br>
      (found on the <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/ASHEsclavus.asp" target="_blank">Zone</a>)</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My travels have allowed me to see nearly
      all Isparian-occupied territories on Dereth. I have observed sights both
      beautiful and horrible. I have always considered myself a rational and
      insightful man, but the events of this day have altered that belief in a
      way that I never thought possible.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had taken a portal north to the town of
      Zaikhal. Reports had reached me that a Virindi installation had been
      discovered beneath a plateau nearby. It was my intention to enter the
      installation, observe them, and leave undetected. I reasoned that my
      expedition would take the greater part of a day, leaving enough time to
      pay a visit to my friend and colleague, Diyas al-Yat.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The wilderness was teeming with life,
      harmless and otherwise, so I was swift of foot to avoid needless
      confrontation. A soft rain fell from the sky, turning the red silt of the
      plateau into thick and runny clay. More than once I feared I would leave
      behind one of my sollerets, but the quest for knowledge spurred me onward.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As I crested a small hill, slick from the
      rain, I spied a green swirl. Exhilarated at the sight, I donned the
      jewelry I carried for combating the Virindi and their minions. Drawing my
      sword, I felt its magic flood me, augmenting my strength. I strapped my
      shield onto my arm and made my way into the portal prepared for whatever
      lay within.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Opaque windows, like those gracing Sho
      buildings, greeted me. The floor was soft and slick. The ceiling appeared
      to be an inverted shingled roof. Everything was surreal, covered in a
      viscous red ooze.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each time I shifted my weight the floor
      made a wet sound. But my trek through the mud-hewn landscape outside was,
      unfortunately, not the cause of the sound. As I knelt to touch the floor's
      surface a thin pink mist rose to meet me. My hand pressed the ground and I
      felt the fleshy material give; I nearly retched.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An uneasy feeling filled me; I searched
      frantically for the portal from this accursed place. The rising mist
      concealed the portal from my vision but the humming sound was
      unmistakable. The portal to the outside rested near the west wall.
      Opposite the portal, a tunnel beckoned.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Flanked by two braziers emitting blue
      flame, the tunnel looked like a gaping maw ready to swallow any that
      ventured too close. The hair on my neck stood on end as I stared into the
      darkness beyond. Overwhelming fear washed over me, and I shuddered, but
      the answers I searched for lay somewhere down that foreboding corridor.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The walls shifted as I broached the
      threshold. Walking through the halls was akin to walking through a living
      mockery of Isparian architecture. My cautious steps slowed my progress,
      but keeping my presence veiled was the largest of my concerns. Never had I
      been so terrified.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The lack of defenses within the structure
      puzzled me. To this point I had been unhampered by even the lowliest of
      the Virindi's servitors.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In retrospect, it is very possible that my
      presence was already known.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After an hour of calculated steps, and
      cartography, I heard voices echo through the corridors. The voices were
      joined by the mews of a drudge and a sound like a thousand flies swarming
      within a jar. An obscured corner ahead drew me closer. Cautiously, I
      peered around to see what lay beyond.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On an altar some twenty feet away lay a
      drudge ravener, its head turned toward me at an impossible angle. Its
      cold, lifeless eyes bored a hole through me. I swallowed hard and watched
      as a Virindi puppet floated into view, produced two sickles, pierced the
      thick stone of the altar and pushed it away.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A second puppet maneuvered another altar
      into its place, this one occupied by a lifeless human corpse. Brown hair
      framed a thin face. Brown eyes, set deeply within his brow, rested above
      high cheekbones. Mortis had etched a sick smile on the dead man's face.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The puppet withdrew its sickles and floated
      down a ramp that lay just out of sight. Seizing the moment I vaulted
      across the hall into the heavy, looming shadow cast by the corner. Coming
      to rest against the opposite wall, I watched two more Virindi approach.
      One who wore robes darker than those of an Executor, moved to the center
      of the altar, facing me. The other, a Master, moved to the head of the
      dead man and gestured with a seemingly empty fold of cloth towards the
      shadowed wall. A brief flash of cerulean light bit nibbled at the
      darkness, and the room. . . shimmered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A vague, vaporous curtain of azure-tinted
      energy rippled slowly down from the ceiling, like thunderclouds rolling
      in. It surrounded the altar in a perfect circle. The stink of
      lightning-burnt air pinched my nose. A massive blast of air then slammed
      into my chest, almost stealing the breath from my lungs. I shook my head
      to clear it as the odd, sudden wind burst whistled away through distant
      corridors.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Master produced its sickles and lifted
      the corpses head with care. I blinked-- from the space inside the strange
      energy field, no further sounds came. The eyes of the corpse remained
      locked on me, as if pleading for assistance. The second Virindi produced a
      thin bladed knife from beneath the folds of its cloak and carved the head
      off the corpse with precision. The Master lifted the head and placed it on
      the corpse's midsection, so that it stared at me. Unnerved, I shifted,
      dried clay scraping beneath my solleret. Fortune smiled on me as my
      movement was minimal enough that it went unnoticed even in that strange
      blue silence.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The “surgeon” floated to the feet of
      the corpse as the Master returned to its head, slipping within the
      confines of the evanescent blue energies. I have seen the Virindi remove
      their masks countless times, but never had I seen what I did today.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From beneath the Master's tattered robes a
      vibrant, violet tentacle--translucent, almost crystalline, yet moving with
      the fluidity and suppleness of water--slipped between the corpse's
      shoulders. The soft light was swallowed by the void within the corpse.
      There was nothing inside; the corpse was hollow, nothing more than a
      shell. A loud buzz filled the corridor. Pink light cascaded from the room
      beyond, bathing the shadow in which I hid in searing rays. The exposed
      skin of my face burned, cracked, and peeled as I slammed my eyes shut and
      yelped in pain.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the hall fell back into darkness, small
      explosions of violet hampered my vision. Through them I watched the last
      vestige of another tentacle slip from the Virindi's robe and into the
      shell.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The robes fell to the floor. The mask
      clattered off the side of the altar and cracked when it struck the floor.
      A swirling vortex of light poured from the spot where the head once fit
      onto the hollow corpse. Suddenly the hands grasped the head and it sat
      upright.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As it moved, the violet energy within
      cascaded over its shoulders. It affixed its head on its shoulders, and
      stared into the shadow where I hid.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">No. . .</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It stared. . . at me, through me.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Have you enjoyed what you have
      witnessed?” The voice thundered inside my head speaking in the Roulean
      tongue. The blue glow vanished and a sharp crack of thunder lanced my
      ears, impelling me to clap my hands over them in pain. A low hum began to
      fill the hall. I turned and ran.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You cannot escape, meatli--friend. Why
      can we not converse?” Retracing my steps I slipped on the slick floor
      and slid hard into the wall. Within my head there came a pain that I shall
      never forget. Deep within my mind I felt an itch, and then something began
      to scratch the itch inside my brain. It pulsated and swelled until the
      pain threatened to shatter my skull.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Struggling to my feet, I chanced a glance
      back toward the tunnel where the surgeon and master had been. Soaked in
      sweat, hearing only a hum and the pounding of my heart, I fled on toward
      the portal. The itching swelled, driving me, stumbling and skidding, to my
      knees once more. I bellowed in agony. Then all was silent, and the pain
      ceased.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the calm that ensued I gasped for air,
      then retched onto the floor. My body trembled and I felt heavy with the
      weight of entropic ruin. My vision swam, unconsciousness encroached.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the hum returned, closer, accompanied
      by the sound of boots trudging along the spongy floor. Survival drove me
      to my feet. I wheeled to face the “surgeon” and the mock human. My
      knees threatened to buckle and I slammed against the wall behind me for
      support. Groaning, I adjusted the grip on my sword and began a defensive
      retreat.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Where do you intend to go, fellow
      Isparian, Antius Blackmoor?” The voice asked inside my head.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“How--? How can you know my name?” I
      sputtered.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We know all you know, fellow Isparian.”
      The placid, molded smile on the simulacra's face seemed twisted and
      sinister. Its eyes no longer begged me for aid. They were probing me,
      sizing me up. “We thank you for your contribution to the New
      Singularity. Levistras will be pleased.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'll. . . kill. . . you. . . &quot; I
      hissed through clenched teeth. I swung my blade toward the “surgeon,”
      overwhelmed by hatred and rage.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cleaving the cloak, it struck home and bit
      solid matter. It felt like hitting gelatin. The simulacra drew forth a
      quiddity sword and tried to land a blow upon me.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I slid along the wall to my right to avoid
      it. I parried a swipe from my floating assailant and sent his scalpel
      spinning onto the floor. My counterattack bit through its cloak once
      again. The cloak sizzled as if filled with hundreds of glowing flies, then
      fluttered to the ground, lifeless.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The simulacra scored a blow to my right
      thigh. Thick blood welled from a grievous wound. I returned the assault
      with a strike that severed the head from the being. A swarm of buzzing
      violet lights poured from the wound I opened. It crumpled to the floor in
      a high-pitched fit of noise. A thin rivulet of light lapped the ground,
      before it crumbled into a fine white dust.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Searching through the crumpled surgeon's
      cloak I found a shard of obsidian, etched with Virindi symbols, and the
      scalpel it once brandished. My head ached but the pain was minor compared
      to the pain I had felt only moments before.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mews and Virindi rumblings filled the
      dungeon behind me. Slipping the scalpel into my belt pouch, I staggered to
      the portal from that forsaken hall.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Rain washed over me, cooling my head and
      the burned flesh of my face. Collapsing to the ground, I stared into the
      sky. After a long moment I applied healing herbs and a poultice to my
      wounded leg. With the injury abated, I stood and tossed the obsidian shard
      into the air. Time to visit Diyas, to decipher this thing.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A few moments later I saw my friend walking
      out of a shop atop a hill in Zaikhal.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Diyas!” I called to him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius, good to see you my friend. What
      can I do for you?” He clapped my shoulder and smiled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Well for one, you can tell me what this
      says.” I handed him the shard. He looked it over and a frown fell across
      his face.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A brisk wind picked up. I placed my hands
      into my pouch to ward off the chill as I waited for his response.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hmm, where did you come by this, Antius?”
      he asked.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“A Virindi stronghold, not that far from
      here.” He nodded.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Can you tell me what it says?” I
      asked.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I could, Antius.” He looked deep
      within my eyes. “But then--&quot; His hands moved to his head and
      pressed hard against the sides, lifting. &quot;--I think you already know
      what it says.” His head came off, and violet energy poured from within.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Aghast, I leapt. My hands instinctively
      clutched the blade of the scalpel in my pouch. The pain and blood that
      resulted confirmed that this nightmare vision was real. I ran, screaming,
      and did not stop until I reached my home in Cragstone.</font></td>
