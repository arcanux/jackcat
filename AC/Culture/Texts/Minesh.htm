    Fror<span lang="en-us">e</span></a><span lang="en-us">.</span></font></em><p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="arial">Purchased from: <br>
    Barkeeper Fo Ya-Un in Hebian-To - 39.1S, 83.4E<br>
    Fenza Tan the Scribe in Hebian-To - 39.3S, 82.9E</font></span></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Woe did come to the children of mighty Dericost. The Lords of
    This World, in their arrogance, were thrown down - Sarvien and his circle slain by the
    whelps of Yalain and Haebrous. The Kingdom crumbled, the Ice Throne was toppled by
    victorious barbarians. So did we, whose doom was wrought by the arrival of the Falatacot
    priestesses six thousand years hence, come to have our presence suffered in our own land. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Feared by the simple creatures who presumed to rule in our
    stead, we were forbidden to practice the crafts that had made our Lords mighty. We were
    turned out from our own ancient fortresses on the fastness of Gelid, and resettled in the
    rank grasslands of Yalain, among herdsmen as dull as their flocks. We were watched and
    mistrusted - blamed for everything that did not occur as those ignorant peasants thought
    should. As if we, the living, had had anything to do with the vile acts of the Lords! As
    if we had traffic with the Thing Ilservian roused! </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">They would hear none of this of course; our blood was that of
    the royal houses of Dericost, and that was guilt enough in their eyes. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Doomed by the cold that had driven the Falatacot south,
    shunned by our conquerors, we sought the blessing of another time of cold. Such things
    come in cycles. The southern barbarians may have forgotten, but the memory of Dericost was
    ancient of days. Does not the sun itself turn wan and pale every several millennia?<font color="#6B6B6B">UCKS</font></small> </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">We only needed to wait until the next Great Frost, and then
    our oppressors would burn from wind-whipped ice. If we prepared properly, we should
    outlast them, and return in glory to high Gelid, which stands mighty over the plains. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">It was foretold by the priestesses that the Fourth Sending
    would begin in a city of Dericost called Frore, which means &quot;Black Frost.&quot; No
    such city existed during the 6000 years of the Kingdom. So it was decided that we should
    make for ourselves a city by that name; being blood of the noble houses, our city would be
    of Dericost. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Debate raged among the brethren - when should Frore be built,
    and where? Was it not presumptuous - dangerous - to attempt to fulfill such a prophesy?
    The prognostications of the Falatacot witches always had hidden barbs. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As we debated, our oppressors blamed us again for a thing
    which was not our doing. One of the Old Lords was found in hiding, in the farthest reaches
    of Haebrous. The Burning Time began, and the sons and daughters of Old Dericost were put
    to fire and sword for the errors of their grandsires. It was decided that we could endure
    no more. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Even as our people were subjected to cruel tortures at the
    hands of the Yalain, two brave souls exacted our revenge against the Grand Inquisitor, who
    oversaw the persecutions against us. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Thus the Burning Time ended, but the barbarians looked at us
    with renewed fear. Peasants again made the Gesture of Shunning as we walked among them,
    wrapped with the cool shadows of our robes, and praying only for isolation and deliverance
    from the ignorant savages. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">It was then decided that we should escape our enforced exile,
    and begin again in a new place. The Work must begin. But, where should we go? The Council
    of Three held fierce debate, but in the end Blessed Fenngar's suggestion won favor;
    Killiakta, Isle of Woe. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">So did we enjoin our meager wealth, and covertly book passage
    on ships headed to the isle. All at once, we left the squalid cities of the south, and met
    with sea-captains in hidden coves along the shore. Our convoy, six ships strong, met off
    the Rock of Sennaj, where the slate-grey sea endlessly beats itself into a useless froth. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">We sailed northwest for uncounted leagues. One cold blue
    twilight, the Great Light of the Yalain mariners was seen over the horizon. We knew then
    that we had reached the southeast of Killiakta. As the moons crept up the dew-dappled
    spider-strands of stars, we ordered the captains to steer north. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Our convoy rounded the shoulder of Ifistra, taking care to
    avoid the patrols from the Yalain port at Aerlinthe. Unmolested, we landed on the northern
    shore, where the peaks of Ifisveraqu meet the sea. It was here that Blessed Ferundi turned
    to the ship captains, thanked them for a safe journey, and signaled that we should begin. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">As the moons stood a placid watch, the shrieks of sailors
    drowned out the crush and roar of the surf. Though we had not used them for many years,
    the arts of the Lords were well known to us in lore. So did we use the crews' blood and
    ash and bone, entrails and meat, for our conversion. A ghastly business it was, but the
    Work needed to be done. As the sun's first rays shone through the frigid north shore fog,
    we fired the charnel-house ships, and watched until they had burned to the waterline. No
    vessel or man passed as we waited, becoming used to our new forms. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Once certain no trace would be left of us, we began the trek
    south, into the mountains. How can we tell of that endless march into wind and snow? It
    was like coming home. Each gust, curling clouds of fine powder off the ground, cheered us.
    Truly, this was the next best thing to old, blessed Gelid! </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">At the direction of the Council, we began to seek our home.
    Some, under Blessed Ferundi, explored the peaks to the east, but this proved too close to
    the Aerlinthe. This party was lucky to escape detection when a party of Yalain's so-called
    mages suddenly emerged from a shelter at the base of one of the greater peaks. Others,
    under Blessed Fenngar, trekked west, but the height of the peaks there were found lacking,
    and the area too easily approached. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">A third group, under Blessed Frisander, searched the mighty
    peaks of old Velacixque, &quot;Blood-Heart&quot; to the Falatacot. Alas, the covetous
    Yalain were present in large numbers, forging coins of magical alloy in the depths of the
    mountain. Turning back north, they were halted by a call. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">There before them stood Lord Rytheran of Menilesh, who had
    commanded our forefathers before the fall of the Ice Throne. He now amused himself as an
    academy master for the barbarians, teaching the barest shreds of magic to the dullard
    children of Yalain. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Ho,&quot; said he. &quot;Declare yourselves! Be ye
    Winds from Darkness or Lords of the World?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Neither,&quot; spake Blessed Frisander. &quot;We are
    our own, come from exile in the southlands. We seek only to be left in peace, until we may
    return to the Plateau of Gelid.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You are of our kind,&quot; spake Rytheran. &quot;You
    must declare for one or another, lest ye wish to be seen by both as a threat. I ask again:
    Winds from Darkness or Lords of the World?&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;We forsake ye!&quot; cried a formidable young mage,
    Frisirth by name. &quot;Your games are your own, and we want none of it. For millennia you
    have played here, ignoring the suffering of your kin as you scheme. Get away now, or ye
    shall be blistered by all the power of our arts!&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Rytheran's face darkened, and he turned to his retainers.
    Before he could speak a word, however, Frisirth loosed a powerful blow against him, nearly
    destroying the Old Lord where he stood. At this, Rytheran's retainers charged the group,
    while he himself cast one of Facill's plane-slant spells, and retreated back into his
    lair. The retainers were weak, and Blessed Frisander's group quickly drained the life from
    them. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The Council met again in the northern reaches of the
    Ifisveraqu shortly after, and agreed that we would need to build in that area to be safe
    from enemies old and new. So, on a small, windy peak overlooking green valleys, we moved
    underground. Natural caves were expanded and restructured, and, at long last, construction
    of Great Frore began. </font></small></td>
