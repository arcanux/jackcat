    <p><font face="arial" size="2">In the past I have been fortunate enough to 
	translate relatively well-preserved tomes. Unfortunately, this tome is so 
	old and damaged that translation is difficult. This scribing is as close to 
	a summary as I can manage given the original condition of the book.<br>
	<br>
	---<br>
	<br>
	It seems that, much like the Sclavus, the Moarsmen were originally from 
	another world. The text describes the two shapes the Moarsmen took, both 
	before and after their interaction with the Falatacot Priestess of ages 
	past. This piece of literature looks to be an account of the eating habits 
	of both the beings known as the Moar as well as what we know as Moarsmen.<br>
	<br>
	The first type of creature, the Moar, is described as a small yet voracious 
	beast. The best I can relate the description to is the Carenzi found 
	commonly on Marae Lassel. The text claims that these small creatures had no 
	specific in their choice of food. The author mentions that their diet was 
	varied, ranging from hunting small frog-like creatures to forming packs to 
	hunt much larger amphibians, as well as scavenging offal and rarely 
	consuming plant material.<br>
	<br>
	The larger version, the one I assume we commonly know as the Moarsmen, was 
	an aggressive hunter. The notes state that the Falatacot would take the 
	Moarsmen with them on outings, similar to the use of hunting hounds in the 
	Aluvian Highlands. However, unlike the wild, smaller Moar, the Moarsman was 
	easily tamable through its stomach. This led to it not being terribly 
	particular about its meals. The note mentions that the Moarsman was more 
	interested in the killing of competition as opposed to eating it.<br>
	<br>
	This face could attribute to the lack of any significant predators on the 
	Vesayen Island.<br>
