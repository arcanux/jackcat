    <i>The door swelled inwards, bubbling, dust running out of the wood’s old 
    veins in slow rivers. Arms locked around from behind. The wall of mist 
    swirled about. The door drifted away…. </i><br>
    <br>
    Salt mist. Alabaster towers rose to touch the fading sky. Bleached bones 
    turned to dust under the dead fish belly of the sky. Fields of bones. Seas 
    of dead and stinking muck. Hands that had been lifted to ward away…. <br>
    <br>
    A thousand voices. The Panic. It lapped over the thin silver line, a single, 
    shrieking titan. Saltwater wavered out to meet the sinking disk of the sun. 
    The foam of the breakers was stained crimson. Waterlogged black shapes 
    drifted, legs beating faintly at the blue. Too many legs. <br>
    <br>
    Great gold-gilt sails ruffled, scattering light across the waves. The chosen 
    clambered up the nets that hung from the hulls. Some simply flashed their 
    eyes and rose from the shore, carried serenely over the froth and foam. <br>
    <br>
    The ships were leaving the Imperial City. The last, sailing far, far away, 
    to safety. But the silver line held back the mass. Not enough ships. Never 
    enough, in all the years of slow retreat. <br>
    <br>
    Inchoate roar. A woman in silver and forest green ducked under the clumsy 
    swing of a man scrambling through the crackling magical barrier. His flesh 
    smoked, his clothes were afire. But he was through. The woman swung her 
    sword and cleaved his head away. It tumbled across the stones of One 
    League’s Dock, long hair smoldering and hissing. Another soldier cursed, and 
    kicked the head into the sea. <br>
    <br>
    Here they come! The skies, the skies! <br>
    <br>
    Stub-shapes swerved around the great towers of the city. Here and there. 
    Flocks. Swarms. A cloud. A line of thunderheads, a wave rising over the 
    roofs and spires. <br>
    <br>
    The crest fell upon the rocks. The towers became coated with them. <br>
    <br>
    The forests around the city began to leach a living purple carpet into the 
    fields. <br>
    <br>
    The bells of Tentael released a final, shrieking crescendo of hysteric 
    bronze, and fell silent. The clatter of alien wings rose to fill the void….
    <br>
    <br>
    The door loomed over the stones of the pier, blotting the bleeding sun. It 
    swelled, a breathing animal. Metal bolts - smoking, spitting - unwound 
    themselves from the hinge plates. No. The arms pulled insistently. The door 
    drifted away…. <br>
    <br>
    Small fighting vessels lifted their skirts clear of the water, which sucked 
    and slapped at the retreating keels. Their port and starboard masts dropped 
    to the horizontal, gold cloth unfurled and swelled with seabreeze. They 
    rose, trailing sparks of magic, like blossoms drifting on the wind. <br>
    <br>
    No no no don’t make yourself a target if you stand up they cut you down if 
    you prick one they will all turn and bite I know them please listen to me!
    <br>
    <br>
    Magic fried the air. Bolts of white and blue threw themselves from the 
    rising ships, thudding into the shifting clouds of purple-grey that hung 
    over the city. Flames and sparks scattered back from the front of the cloud. 
    A hideous rain began to fall. Thunder. The susurration of one million wings, 
    gentle as spring rain. <br>
    <br>
    The lead ship tacked into the wind, turning its broadside to the onrushing 
    cloud. Gales of magic sprang from the decks to chip away at the edge of the 
    mass. <br>
    <br>
    Fly away! Why do you never listen? <br>
    <br>
    Clattering insects alighted on the ship, wings beating themselves to 
    transparency as their legs scuttled for purchase on the side of the hull. 
    Cries of alarm went up. Perhaps they went up. The ship was too high to hear, 
    its sea-blue pennants jerking in stiff winds that never reached the ground.
    <br>
    <br>
    Figures on her decks vomited white-hot mana into the eyes and mandibles of 
    the insects. One fell from the hull, tumbling end over end, ragged wings 
    trailing fire and green ichor as they uselessly fanned their own flames. It 
    landed in the crowds somewhere, and was lost. <br>
    <br>
    More black stubs swarmed the ship. Ten converged. Twenty. Too many to count. 
    From all over the sky they came, rising from the alabaster bell towers. The 
    hull became black with them. <br>
    <br>
    The starboard mast ripped away, taking a section of the hull and another 
    insect with it. The monster clung to the debris, faithfully ripping chunks 
    from the wood all the way to the ground. It bounced among the milling Panic, 
    crushing someone too distant to see. <br>
    <br>
    The ship sagged under the weight, the insects piled three deep on the decks. 
    The afterdecks slipped, and it began to slide backwards toward the ground, 
    sails and rigging in tatters, insects trapped and buzzing angrily among the 
    ropes. <br>
    <br>
    Another figure toppled from the deck. Its shape was different - small, four 
    limbs flailing. It severed at the waist. One half continued to shriek as it 
    fell. <br>
    <br>
    One soldier stood distinct, carved before the blurred backdrop of the Panic, 
    clad in the silver and green armor of the Iälarchess. No… he watched the 
    figure topple from the ship to wet the stones of Imperial Square, his mouth 
    agape. <br>
    <br>
    Tiersa, hold the line! Behind you! <br>
    <br>
    We will go now. A voice of great calm, cold as stone in winter. The face 
    swam at him from the deck of the sailing frigate. Cold grey eyes looked out 
    upon the Panic. <br>
    <br>
    We command you to come. You will be useful to Us. Arms locked around from 
    behind, wrenching, hurling. Gruff northern words. The world spun, the 
    heaving surface of the waters shattered like a glass box, rippling like the 
    air around a portal. It will let us travel far in the space of a breath. The 
    silver tunnel formed, the Panic drifted away…. <br>
    <br>
    The door reared up from the sea. It shivered into straw, holes exploding 
    through the thick wood. Limpid coils of ebon fog flowed through the gaps, 
    blackening and shriveling wood and stone. Urgent hands grasped and yanked.
    <br>
    <br>
    I will not see you! <br>
    <br>
    Turn, agonizingly slow. Pulling against the tree sap tide. Swimming, gasping 
    like a fish. The door drifted away, reluctantly, hovering…. <br>
    <br>
    A hallway, a world circumscribed by stiff ranks of unsmiling silver and 
    green armor. There was a door- <br>
    <br>
    …door bleeding acid tar…. <br>
    <br>
    - before them. Within that cell, a mother raged. <br>
    <br>
    Intriguing…. <br>
    <br>
    Violet light split apart. The world tilted sideways, and all the breath was 
    knocked out of him. He rose. The air broiled, thick in the lungs, tainted 
    with streams of yellow and grey vapor. Spore clouds waltzed slowly downwards 
    through shafts of dim orange light. <br>
    <br>
    Look up. That was always the first thing. The quality of the light was 
    different every place they went. There had been a world of gentle oceans and 
    simple people that had a warm, bronze quality, a nostalgic luster. Here, the 
    sun was tired, old, sick. It hovered, bloated like a tick, above a sea of 
    mushroom caps. Tendrils of fire writhed away from its limb. <br>
    <br>
    The tendrils reached down, seared the blighted earth, reached for the blood 
    of his companions. The world breathed quietly, inimitably hostile. Brooding, 
    waiting to suck the marrow from their dead, bleached bones. <br>
    <br>
    The fields of bones. Fossilized hands reaching up to ward off…. <br>
    <br>
    This place is dangerous, my lord. THEY are dangerous. We should…. <br>
    <br>
    Silence. I wish to observe what your pupils have brought me. Cold grey eyes 
    stared in at the grieving mother. One pale finger stroked his chin. The face 
    was made of ice. <br>
    <br>
    The mushroom twilight. The air was alive with the buzz and ratchet of life 
    innumerable. The adepts spread out, moving the undernourished ferns aside 
    with small pops of light from their eyes, diligently seeking samples for 
    study. One of them bent to get a better look at a hissing, four-foot 
    centipede that scuttled over the rocks. He coughed discretely into his hand, 
    then wiped it on his robe. A grey patch clung to the fabric. <br>
    <br>
    The cells. The mother hissed at the cool grey eyes. She threw herself at 
    them, shrieking for the loss of her children, and was repulsed by blue-white 
    fire. <br>
    <br>
    A golden-eyed boy lay cold and still in the next cell, a bloom of fish-pale 
    mushrooms rising from his mouth, from the warm, moist cave of his lungs. <br>
    <br>
    A squeal carried across the clearing. The adepts sprang up as one. On a 
    small rise, a large cricket-like creature squatted on its hind legs. 
    Antennae, twice as long as its body, waved in the humid yellow wind. Its 
    squeal reverberated through the forest of pulpy grey stalks. <br>
    <br>
    One of the adepts moved towards it. It sprang well away, sat up once more, 
    and resumed its cry. <br>
    <br>
    You will allow it to breed. They should be of use to Our empire. Many 
    glories await the Cerulean Throne of Yalain. <br>
    <br>
    But they are feral. <br>
    <br>
    The ground trembled. The cricket fell silent, and hopped away into the murk.
    <br>
    <br>
    The adepts gathered close. <br>
    <br>
    The ground exploded. Massive arms, barbed, purple, gleaming dully, boiled 
    up. An enormous shape reared back. Glowering red eyes, faceted like a jewel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Stay away from it! <br>
    <br>
    It looked at them, and cocked its head. A familiar motion. A comforting 
    motion. The adepts gasped, smiling. Delacim stepped forward, reaching up to 
    touch the glittering shell of the thing. Magnificent! Can it be intelligent, 
    Master? <br>
    <br>
    The memory of hands rubbed a ghostly chin, thoughtfully. I do not- <br>
    <br>
    The massive arms came down. The bubbling screech rooted them to the earth.
    <br>
    <br>
    The cold grey eyes of the crown glowed covetously at the young mother. <br>
    <br>
    We will control them with our art. <br>
    <br>
    They cannot be controlled. They shrug aside our art like water. Cousin, 
    plea- <br>
    <br>
    The royal person yanked itself away from supplicating hands. <br>
    <br>
    Cast the portal cast the portal ai sweet Light preserve us Delacim the 
    festering stink of blood and raw meat clouds of black flies descend from the 
    mushroom caps the huge creature scything through the adepts cold efficient 
    brutal swimming through the mage fire… <br>
    <br>
    The cold eyes flashed like steel. <br>
    <br>
    Mind your tongue, mongrel. Your life is long, still. <br>
    <br>
    The eyes narrowed, darted up and down, measuring. Hating. The old fear 
    reaches in, grasps the heart within its icy, corpse-like claws. <br>
    <br>
    It would not do if your life became known to Our court, blood of my wife. 
    You are dismissed. Do as We bid you, or Valind shall hear your name. <br>
    <br>
    Tapered, impatient fingers snapped. The clank and crunch of armor echoed in 
    the passage. Don’t move. More can be done here. Quietly. Remember what 
    happened to the Sisters. Remember the marble green eyes. Patience. Whispers.
    <br>
    <br>
    But there wasn’t enough time for whispers to carry. <br>
    <br>
    The dead boy stood before him, the mushrooms in his mouth growing thicker, 
    attaching themselves to the walls like creeper vines. His face became 
    Delacim’s, his eyes burned with bitter accusation. You let me die. His face 
    became a thousand others, became Thorsten Cragstone’s, warped and fell as if 
    made of wax. <br>
    <br>
    Plated arms locked around from behind, yanking, pulling. The world spun. The 
    cell drifted away…. <br>
    <br>
    The door. <br>
    <br>
    Again. <br>
    <br>
    Ropes of back mist pulsated through the holes in the wood. The door turned 
    grey, veined, flowed like hot wax, squealed like a gutted animal…. <br>
    <br>
    Please don’t make me watch. <br>
    <br>
    Red eyes in the hallway. The torches sputter. They fade with a gasp. Mighty 
    wings. He stumbled back. <br>
    <br>
    The arms yanked him. The black wings whirled away. <br>
    <br>
    Violet light. Energies that cracked and shattered the air. <br>
    <br>
    She wavered as she stood, tossing her cane away, too strong to need it 
    further. The light rippled off copper-silver hair. Her hands gripped either 
    side of his head. <br>
    <br>
    Her eyes were golden, warm honey, filled with love, filled with tears. <br>
    <br>
    Wh…what? We have- <br>
    <br>
    Iä hlatun aune atep. I give this life for love. <br>
    <br>
    No! <br>
    <br>
    The hands on his arms held fast. Steel. Her rings drove the flesh in. 
    Feathers tickled his ear. Be quick, sister. <br>
    <br>
    Hot breath exploded into the room. It howled, inarticulately, in triumph. 
    Dust ran from the stones as it pounded inwards. <br>
    <br>
    Iä hlatun aune atep. I give this life for love. <br>
    <br>
    Her eyes began to glow with power. <br>
    <br>
    No! Not again! Please I don’t want to watch this again oh Lights of the 
    world please… <br>
    <br>
    A voice spoke calmly in his ear. <br>
    <br>
    Listen to her words. She only need say them in the Old Tongue, yet she says 
    them for you, child. <br>
    <br>
    The old men took a last free breath and cast their eyes in stone. The last 
    woman, platinum hair swaying, closed her eyes, shook her head, and turned to 
    the light. Fate was accepted. Gold and silver luminescence erupted from 
    their eyes. The violet cloud spun faster. The room began to roar. Dust and 
    pebbles spiraled inward. <br>
    <br>
    Iä hlatun aune atep. I give this life for love. <br>
    <br>
    Not for me! <br>
    <br>
    She does this for her love of you. I do this for my love of the world. You 
    have a destiny. <br>
    <br>
    Seawater ran down his cheeks. The humid metal stench of rent life. The arms 
    of the woman flooded red. The hands clamped on his ears became moist. He 
    jerked, tried to shake his head NO. His hands clawed at hers. <br>
    <br>
    Remember this. It will pain you, but it will keep your soul shriven. 
    Remember what one can do for another out of love. <br>
    <br>
    Two pieces of crystal met, clacking like marble. <br>
    <br>
    I’ll bet you can’t get a marble sphere like this! I stole it from the 
    belltower at Imperial Square. You did not! Did too! <br>
    <br>
    A white-bearded man turned to a comrade in iridescent silver plate. They 
    nodded to each other with respect. Soon it would be over. The bearded man 
    gripped his staff and spun about, his blue robe swirling. <br>
    <br>
    Iä hlatun aune atep. I give this life for love. <br>
    <br>
    Cyan light washed over his shoulder. Indescribable power rolled past, like a 
    gromnatross wheeling overhead. He ducked, instinctively. At the center of 
    the room, the old men learned into the wind that whipped towards the 
    gossamer swirl behind them. A third crystal slid into the breach. <br>
    <br>
    Remember this. You will stumble and fail. You will carry the hatred of many 
    worlds, and you will come to hate yourself. Never despair! With every rising 
    of the sun, the world begins anew. One morning they shall awake and 
    understand. <br>
    <br>
    The platinum haired woman’s eyes burned. The fourth crystal crawled inwards, 
    its facets becoming lost in the glare. She let her proud chin fall, and 
    shook her head again, sadly. There was still work to be done, but now…. <br>
    <br>
    Iä hlatun aune atep. I give this life for love. <br>
    <br>
    The hands holding his head weakened. She shuddered. Please don’t! But she 
    smiled, lower lip trembling, fresh tears swelling in her radiant eyes. Her 
    thumb gently traced across his cheek, and she touched her forehead to his.
    <br>
    <br>
    Remember this. Not all our souls were paired in the beginning. Those few who 
    walk alone are the agents of Light. They have the strength to move the 
    world, for good or ill. I see three such men when I touch the threads about 
    you. You must be there to tilt the balance against the men who would move us 
    into madness. Remember this! <br>
    <br>
    Who are these men, Adja? <br>
    <br>
    Do you not see, sister-son? Here is one of them now! <br>
    <br>
    The beast, its ebony back bowing the rafters high above, snorted what might 
    have been a chuckle. Its claws stretched towards the white-bearded man. He 
    gripped his staff tighter. His eyes poured silver light into the abeyance.
    <br>
    <br>
    “I love you, my child,” Maila whispered, diamonds spilling from her eyes in 
    impossible numbers. Turning to the middle of the room, her eyes flashed a 
    final time. <br>
    <br>
    The talons sank into the soft flesh of the bearded man’s skull. The fifth 
    crystal, the one that hovered above the rest, sank downwards. <br>
    <br>
    No! NO! <br>
    <br>
    Her hands slid away. He pawed numbly at them, trying to keep them from 
    going, as he’d tried to pull them away heartbeats before. <br>
    <br>
    Red and grey dripped from the beast’s claw. Its free hand reached toward the 
    rippling heat-haze of violet. <br>
    <br>
    You must do your part, now, Asheron. <br>
    <br>
    He looked up. When had he knelt before her corpse, placed her head in his 
    lap? <br>
    <br>
    The knots in Adja’s sable hair were coming undone. Marble-green eyes watched 
    him calmly. The same turquoise as the waters of home. Like sinking in the 
    waters of home. Warm even in winter. Ringing the rocky shores of the island 
    in argent froth. The sea mists left the crags dripping. The rich green of 
    the fields. Come to dinner, son. Eat of the bounty I have placed before you. 
    My precious, precious child. <br>
    <br>
    We believe in you. <br>
    <br>
    He swam in the Lady of Ithaenc’s eyes, as his own flared with golden light.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moved by his will, the last piece snapped into place with a fateful click.
    <br>
    <br>
    She smiled. He had never seen her smile before. <br>
    <br>
    Violet light. <br>
    <br>
    The lightning that twitched from the crystals snapped, acquired fluidity. 
    The black wings were wrapped in them, doused in light unquenchable. <br>
    <br>
    The gates of heaven after all… <br>
    <br>
    White. <br>
    <br>
    Bleach. <br>
    <br>
    Blister. <br>
    <br>
    Ash. <br>
    <br>
    Nothing but ash. <br>
    <br>
    “Mother! Mother!” <br>
    <br>
    The door closed. <br>
    <br>
    His eyes snapped open. <br>
    <br>
    He jerked up, the breath caught and tangled in his throat, clawing to be 
    free. <br>
    <br>
    Ships. Cells. Ash. His heart hammered frantically at the gates of his chest. 
    Only then did the dream fall apart, and release him. <br>
    <br>
    “You all right?” <br>
    <br>
    He looked to the door. The sky was the purple of a bruise, a few stars 
    sputtering valiantly before the onset of dawn. Elysa stood in silhouette, 
    arms crossed, one hip leaning against the frame. <br>
    <br>
    “Ai.” He passed his hands over his face, using magic to remove to sweat of 
    the dream from his cheeks, the roots of his own snowy beard. His eyes glowed 
    with it, faintly illuminating the blankets, the shelves, and the stairs 
    leading up to the study. <br>
    <br>
    “The dream again?” she asked, moving into the room. Her hair was woven into 
    a long, honey-colored braid, and she wore a simple sleep-shift. <br>
    <br>
    “Yes. Did I wake you? I’m sorry.” He looked to the candle beside the bed, 
    and at his silent command a ball of roiling, watery blue flame swirled out 
    of nothingness and settled on the wick. <br>
    <br>
    She shrugged, settling herself at the foot of the bed. “I was already awake. 
    I heard you, though.” <br>
    <br>
    “Did I wake Borelean?” <br>
    <br>
    A smile quirked one corner of her mouth. “No, he’s still asleep. Dreaming of 
    Celdiseth’s apprentice, no doubt.” <br>
    <br>
    “He’s only eleven,” he said vaguely. <br>
    <br>
    “Old enough to dream. You should have seen his eyes when he first saw her 
    that night.” Her smile became wistful, and old. <br>
    <br>
    He looked around. Everything seemed to be in order. There had been a time, 
    just after the Sundering, when the dream had caused him to cast in his 
    sleep. Getting up had been a tedious process of straightening the books and 
    furniture that had been thrown about. Once he had nearly burned the keep 
    down. <br>
    <br>
    “I don’t think,” he said, “that I’ll be able to sleep again soon.” <br>
    <br>
    “Me neither.” By the waterlight of the candle, he noticed her eyes were 
    red-rimmed and haunted. She must have been dreaming of the final days of her 
    war. It seemed that the longer they spent together, the more they dreamed in 
    resonance. It was not uncommon among Yalaini couples. Of course, she was not 
    Yalaini, and they were not a couple. Just a pair of wounded souls the world 
    seemed to have passed by. Except for the times it demanded their presence.
    <br>
    <br>
    “Shall we go to the gallery, then?” She nodded briskly and rose, perhaps 
    grateful for the early company. <br>
    <br>
    The first year she had been here, she would barely speak to him. More than 
    once, she had screamed and flailed at him in helpless fury, as she had the 
    first time that they had met. Why haven’t you rescued my people? How could 
    you let this happen? All he could do was to stammer that he hadn’t known. 
    How could he have? He hadn’t stepped beyond this island in a century. <br>
    <br>
    As time passed, they spent more mornings after troubled sleep together in 
    the gallery. <br>
    <br>
    He tossed back the covers and levered himself out of the bed, his head 
    passing close by the stylized portal etched on the wall. The magically 
    wrought violet clouds shifted and compressed, in constant motion - like 
    portalspace itself. Long ago, it had been a popular wall decoration among 
    the planar mages of the Empire. <br>
    <br>
    He followed her out on to the battlement, into a storm of morning birdsong. 
    The moons had already set. To the east, the sky was grey and formless. 
    Perhaps it would rain today. He looked to the trees in the courtyard, and 
    smiled to see a slender, mist-grey Dericostian neuzali perched next to the 
    earth-toned bulk of an Isparian sorrel warbler. Both birds fluffed into 
    aggrieved balls to exchange full-throated insults over possession of the 
    branch. The smile froze on his face when he considered the tableau as a 
    metaphor, and he hurried on. <br>
    <br>
    The wind picked up, setting the trees to murmuring and rousing the heavy 
    scent of the lavender Elysa had planted. The predawn twilight was a bit 
    chilly - without thinking, he cast a small warming spell around them. She 
    blinked and smiled. “Thank you.” He nodded, and looked to the door ahead of 
    her. His eyes flashed a Beckon, and it glided open. <br>
    <br>
    “Lazy,” she said affectionately. “No wonder people think the Empyrean were 
    decadent. You can’t even open a door without using magic.” <br>
    <br>
    “You wouldn’t have let me open it for you otherwise.” She smiled again, and 
    reached up to tap her index finger on the tip of his nose. <br>
    <br>
    Before the wide window of the tower were three chairs. He settled in the 
    tallest, its stonework painted in the traditional floral pattern. It was an 
    uncomfortable seat, but he deserved no more. Elysa scraped her own chair up 
    next to him. It was rough-hewn wood in the Aluvian style. She unfolded the 
    homespun quilt hung over its back and wrapped it around her shoulders. The 
    stool - Borelean’s, and made by his own hand - remained against the wall.
    <br>
    <br>
    They sat there for some time, silently, as the bruise of the sky softened to 
    the color of a rose about to bloom. <br>
    <br>
    “I had a dream about Thorsten,” Elysa said, as if it were the weather. He 
    knew her well enough to tell when her nonchalance was feigned, and looked to 
    her. Tears swelled in her eyes, spilled, gently washed her cheeks. She made 
    no sound. She did not look at him, did not look away, did not let her gaze 
    falter from the window. “I still dream about him. I didn’t even know him for 
    a year. Why do the Mothers still let him walk among my dreams every night?”
    <br>
    <br>
    He paused, not sure whether she wanted an answer. He had found that humans 
    often asked questions they did not truly want answered, or did not want 
    answered truly. But she blinked, upsetting the balance of the waters, and 
    glanced at him. The harrowed blue of her eyes told him all he needed. <br>
    <br>
    “My people,” he told her, “believe that when the body dies, the…the Wind of 
    Greater Thoughts…ah…soul? The fire we see in the depths of an eye. It does 
    not burn out, and it doesn’t travel to cold fields or cloisters of Light to 
    wait out eternity. Instead it hovers close, watching over the one that 
    mattered most to it in this life, until that one is also released. Then both 
    are born again, in the places and times required that they should meet once 
    more. Although they do not recall the other times they walked together under 
    the stars, paired souls never let each other go. <br>
    <br>
    “They say that this is the way Light bade us be made. None of us whole 
    without another, that we should never lose our sympathy for others.” He 
    shifted in his chair, the marble-green eyes in his mind smiling quietly. <br>
    <br>
    “What are you saying, Ash?” she whispered, thin white fingers plucking the 
    quilt closer around herself. <br>
    <br>
    He swallowed. It could unbind her tears once more. <br>
    <br>
    “I say…that you and Thorsten have known each other for a long time. You may 
    only recall a year, but your souls have touched hands since before the stars 
    were carved out of fire, and before the stones were set upon their courses. 
    And you will meet him again. You will know each other until the stars 
    themselves pass on into darkness.” <br>
    <br>
    She closed her eyes, her mouth puckering, and cried hard and silent for a 
    long time. <br>
    <br>
    Their hands reached for each other, and they held on tightly, Empyrean and 
    Isparian, both their worlds lost. <br>
    <br>
    For now. <br>
    <br>
    The sun came up; the world began.
