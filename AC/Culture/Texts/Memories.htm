    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    I've escaped from the undead woman that rules the Sclavus here, at least for 
    now. After I awoke, the pain receded enough for me to search the room. I 
    found a dead man in the corner and dressed him in my clothes, leaving him on 
    the stone table where I had awakened. Perhaps she would think me dead, if 
    not I could hopefully escape before she found me. I followed the passage 
    out, but it came to a dead end. That's when I remembered a word she had 
    spoken when leaving, &quot;ahkree&quot;. The wall blocking the passage vanished when I 
    spoke the word. <br>
    <br>
    Every move I made hurt and I was sure that her Sclavus would cut me down 
    before Imade it to the surface. Strangely, the Sclavus seemed unconcerned 
    with my passing, they merely watched me searching the crypt rooms and 
    passages. They would not let me leave the lower levels. They blocked my 
    attempts to get by them, and I was too weak to overpower them. I continued 
    my search through the crypts rooms and found this hidden room. I found a 
    discarded Sclavus skin that serves now to hold these words. I can only hope 
    the undead woman doesn't know of this room. The pain is returning an I must 
    sleep now. <br>
    <br>
    I cannot escape. There are too many Sclavus guarding the exits to these 
    crypts, if a crypt is what this place is. I have seen the Sclavus praying 
    and performing complicated rituals in the room with the bloody altar. The 
    pain in my chest grows worse by the hour; my skin itches and burns. I feel 
    safe in my hidden room here and I have found food of a sort, but I must find 
    a way to get by the guards and escape or I fear I will die. It's difficult 
    to think clearly through the pain. I must concentrate, perhaps I noticed 
    something when I arrived. <br>
    <br>
    I should start at the beginning. My friend Dalius warned me not to go. In 
    talks of his adventures he had mentioned an old temple he had found in the 
    south dires infested with Sclavus. I found the idea of discovering a lost 
    temple and killing some Sclavus in the process irresistible. Dalius told me 
    not to go, that it was too dangerous, I laughed at his caution and told him 
    that I would kill the Sclavus even if he could not. If only I had listened 
    to him. <br>
    <br>
    I found the sandstorm he had talked of and sought its eye. I easily 
    dispatched the Sclavus I encountered before reaching the temple. It was then 
    that the Sclavus ambushed me. They had been lying in wait, as if they knew 
    of my arrival before hand. <br>
    <br>
    They overwhelmed me, capturing me easily. They beat me until I stopped 
    struggling and I remember being dragged through a portal as I lost 
    consciousness. When I came to I was stretched out on a cold stone table and 
    could hear someone chanting in a strange language. It felt as if a giant 
    hand pressed down on me, my breath became shallow. Something slid onto my 
    stomach and curled there, then the pain came. Every muscle in my body 
    spasmed in time with the chanting. <br>
    <br>
    As I wrote before, I awoke later and devised a way of escaping the room I 
    had been locked in. I wish I had learned portal magicfrom my wife. She was 
    always trying to teach me, but I've never been very good at magic. I will 
    rest again and make another attempt to get by the guards tomorrow. <br>
    <br>
    My torch burned out and I awoke in the dark curled up in pain. Even without 
    the torch I can see everything in a blinding red light, even though my eyes 
    are clenched shut. My skin burns as if it is on fire and being flayed. I 
    write my last words here in the hope that my wife may learn what happened to 
    me. <br>
    <br>
    I love you Talira, I will always love you and I am sorry that I failed you. 
    I would not risk our life together if I had it to do over. It is better that 
    I die than continue in such agony. Know that my last thoughts were of you my 
    love. <br>
    <br>
    I did not expect to ever wake again, my fever is gone and the pain has 
    almost left me. We are so tired. I caught a rat from the cages to eat. I was 
    so hungry that I forgot to cook it. On the way back, I saw my reflection in 
    one of the pools and we see now that it would have been better if I had 
    died. I have become something like the Sclavus and a pale reflection of the 
    human we once were. Somehow I cannot bring myself to loathe my new form, 
    perhaps it is her will that we are happy. I can hear her voice in the back 
    of my mind. I now know that I have been hearing it for many days. She tells 
    us to guard the temple and perform the rites. <br>
    <br>
    We are accepting of our new life. We, Gareth, still wishes that we remember 
    him and his love, so we will write our memories down before they slip away. 
    You were once a man named Gareth Dain. You were a brash warrior who loved 
    his wife and his life with her. Her name was Talira Dain and she loved us 
    deeply. Do not forget her, but never let her see us again for we are hideous 
    in her eyes. <br>
    <br>
    I remember a day in the sun with Talira, we loved and life was good. I 
    remember being warm and happy. I am so cold now. <br>
    <br>
    Do not let Talira know my fate. I am dead. <br>
