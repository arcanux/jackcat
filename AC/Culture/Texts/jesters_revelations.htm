    <p><br>
    <font size="2" face="arial">While the blessed peace remains, I will record what I can remember of the 
	terrible things I have seen and been part of. What a sad irony it is, that 
	even when I am lucid, I find myself almost driven mad when I think of the 
	tragedy and disaster that resulted from my foolish actions, which were 
	undertaken with only good intentions. I believed I was acting boldly and 
	pursuing an imaginative solution to what seemed like an intractable problem. 
	There is a saying that no good deed goes unpunished; perhaps evil deeds 
	undertaken for a good purpose are doubly punished.<br>
	<br>
	First I must beg forgiveness of my good master, Lord Cynreft of House Mhoire, 
	and his noble family, who treated me with kindness and who deserved only my 
	full and humble devotion. I must also beg the forgiveness of the Lord 
	Rytheran, and by extension, His Eternal Splendor, as my actions may have 
	compounded the mistakes they were already making. If I had not sought to 
	interfere in the struggle of the nobles, if I had been content to be the 
	Fool in service to a House that was virtuous, but doomed to die, perhaps we 
	would all be better off. Better a true death and a cold grave than the cruel 
	fate that claimed us all and holds us to this day.<br>
	<br>
	I knew about the curse of unlife that had come upon the Eternal Court of 
	Dericost. I knew what foul rot had infected the heart of our realm, and 
	caused my noble lord of Mhoire to take his household into hiding and flee 
	from the corruption that sought them out. I know my lord used every talent 
	and trick in his considerable magical repertoire to hide his House and 
	castle. I knew that His Eternal Splendor and his right hand, Lord Rytheran 
	of Menilesh, were angered with my lord's defiance, and sought to punish 
	him... if only they could penetrate the screens and shadows that concealed 
	us from their searching eyes.<br>
	<br>
	I snuck out of the Mhoire sanctum one night and approached Lord Rytheran 
	with a bold plan. My master had always believed Lord Rytheran to be 
	slow-witted and easily manipulated, so I trusted in my own wit and 
	cleverness. I told him I would lead him to my master's location, betray his 
	secrets, if he would grant me the power afforded by that unholy book, whose 
	name I will not even write down. Make me a godling, I told him, and he could 
	have the Mhoires. It was my intent to use my new powers to foil their plans 
	and save the Mhoires from imperial revenge. Lord Rytheran agreed, more 
	easily than I anticipated. I planned to betray him, just as he, as I found 
	out, planned to betray me. And in the end, we were all betrayed by forces 
	beyond our comprehension, and ultimately by our own arrogance.<br>
	<br>
	Lord Rytheran promised more than he could give, or perhaps more than he 
	intended to give. I had thought that he had mastered the book and its 
	powers. I know now that he used me to test the power of the book. He read a 
	page to me, and I could, indeed, feel incredible power flowing into me, like 
	a river running high and wild in the rainy season. It was too much for any 
	mortal to contain. With the promised power and eternal life came a curse of 
	growing madness, an inability to control the chaotic power within me. It was 
	all I could do just to keep from destroying myself and everything around me, 
	and my control was slipping. I could feel the malevolent will of the book 
	like a living thing, coiled around me, hungering and waiting for my will to 
	give out.<br>
	<br>
	I believe Lord Rytheran knew exactly what he had done. He cast me out and 
	allowed me to return to the Mhoires. I had lost myself to such a degree that 
	I forgot to protect the Mhoires' secrets. I went straight to their hidden 
	refuge and stumbled through their doors, gibbering nonsense, and my lord of 
	Mhoire knew what had happened to me. He told me he could sense the presence 
	of Rytheran and the book itself through me. That I had become Rytheran's 
	unwitting weapon and delivered myself exactly where he wanted me, into the 
	heart of the Mhoire sanctum, with the book's vile powers bleeding chaos 
	across his polished marble floors, a beacon to those who had made use of the 
	book. I was the vessel for the destruction that befell the Mhoires that day.<br>
	<br>
	Before Lord Rytheran and the imperial court arrived to rain destruction upon 
	House Mhoire, Lord Cynreft took the time to order me chained and sealed 
	behind a wall, to enjoy my eternal madness alone and with no hope of rescue. 
	Doom came to us all that day, though not all of us realized it. The House of 
	Mhoire was cursed to the very undeath that they sought to avoid, and their 
	estate destroyed and trapped in a hellish grave-realm of Rytheran's making. 
	I gained a share of their torment, with them yet separated from them, truly 
	the worst of both bargains. And Lord Rytheran, in using the book on me and 
	upon the Mhoires, fell prey to the whispered blandishments of the book. 
	Rytheran was already a damned and evil creature, tainted by the stolen blood 
	magic of savage Falatacot priesteses. But the book, given an opening, became 
	part of him, as it is now part of me...<br>
	<br>
	Now I find myself released from Lord Cynreft's prison. Lord Cynreft and his 
	lady wife are both here, wandering this strange and cursed land, as is my 
	poor lost love Laylana. I have heard that Rytheran broods alone in his own 
	destroyed tower, regretting his own use of the book and separated from his 
	lady. What elegantly wretched figures we all are, moldy puppets dancing on 
	the strings of demonic masters beyond even our undying comprehension.<br>
	<br>
	Oh yes, I have a master still, after all these years. There was a voice that 
	kept me company during my ten thousand years of torment. It is a voice whose 
	name I dare not commit to writing, or even speak aloud. It is a voice of 
	destruction, corruption, and madness. It seeks a way out into the world, to 
	suck the life from our land as I once delighted in squeezing the juice from 
	a ripe fruit. I know that this island of Killiakta is an island both cursed 
	and blessed, and it is a crossroads of immensely powerful forces. The voice 
	has plans for this land, and for me. Lord Rytheran's misjudgment, made 
	possible by my own arrogance, has created an opening to be exploited. 
	Forgive me. Forgive us all. I fear we cannot forgive ourselves.</font></p>
