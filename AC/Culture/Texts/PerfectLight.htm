    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Long have the years been for me, and in this time I have come to understand 
    the necessity of armies. My father once stood as the beacon against the 
    darkness and so marched his army against the swelling tide lead by he who 
    shall not be named. Through his sacrifice the truths were learned, and the 
    Council of Five was convened to discover a means to eliminate the darkness.
    <br>
    <br>
    My father was slain in that assault as was all, save one, of his army. She 
    returned altered, a withered husk of what she had been with tales of horrors 
    the likes of which none should have ever need to bear witness. <br>
    <br>
    I am left now with a choice. As the Nali spreads the word of the Northern 
    Church throughout the Empire more beckon to her call and as such her 
    followers grow. If she succeeds in moving the seat of the church to Tentael 
    then she will have command over the armies of the newly crowned Emperor as 
    well. <br>
    <br>
    Newly crowned... How hard those words are to read and to write. This is not 
    some ascendance to the Cerulean Throne. Nay, I feel as though a crime that 
    has roots extending deep into the framework of our society has the strings 
    behind this appointment. <br>
    <br>
    Empress Cellaurai's disappearance nearly two years ago was shrouded in 
    mystery. The Nali's position was not questioned when the Empress went 
    missing rather she was called to assist in the investigation into her 
    disappearance. My position and discoveries have kept me silent through these 
    times and perhaps that is why these events transpired under the guise of 
    such coincidence. <br>
    <br>
    I fear that the level of corruption that has been wrought upon my people is 
    another sign of future events, and through divination I am certain that 
    there is another crest building to rise against the Empyreans. My search for 
    an heir to the burden that I carry is complete and his education has begun 
    in earnest yet there are still obstacles that I must face. <br>
    <br>
    Knorr has a standing force of defenders, for though the Dericost have been 
    usurped and driven under there is still a likelihood that one day there will 
    be another insurgence. We have thus maintained the craft that was the 
    discovery of my father and the forges deep within the heart of Knorr have 
    been stoked for all the years that I have sat as its Lord. <br>
    <br>
    There we carve weapons wrought of the mystical pyreal and hammer them into 
    the weapons that shall be used to strike against the Darkness and back 
    reflections should they come to storm again. <br>
    <br>
    At each of Knorr's Libraries we, myself and my eldest Councillors, have set 
    one fourth of the knowledge to create the stones that shall be used in the 
    fight of Light against Dark. There they shall remain until they are needed 
    again. <br>
    <br>
    My life is one that is already nearing an age beyond what most would call 
    usual. To that end I fear that if Nali Valind were to ever discover the 
    truth of my age that I should be purged, as such I must ensure that the 
    Light will retain champions against the darkness. To that end I shall borrow 
    a lesson from the Ishilai Lyceum. I will establish a secret order that will 
    stand as a force that will usher the Light where Darkness falls. <br>
    <br>
    At the Barracks of Knorr they shall be recognized as the true warriors that 
    they shall be known as. Within the halls of Knorr they shall be known as the 
    defenders of the Lyceum and they shall serve as my army should we fall to a 
    time of war. <br>
    <br>
    They will wear badges of honor and merit as they progress through the trials 
    of purity and rise to positions of prominence. <br>
    <br>
    They shall come from the ranks of the Heiromancer's, and of the Medi they 
    shall be masters of all paths and they shall be marshalled for the purpose 
    of maintaining order where corruption would try to stand. <br>
    <br>
    To join the Order of Perfect Light one shall need to become an adept of each 
    of the fourteen spheres of magic, for without an understanding of all that 
    encompasses this world we cannot strive to see it thrive. Then they shall be 
    ushered to the level of Defender of the Light and attain the rank of 
    Initiate. They shall be chosen by myself or by the others who hold tenure 
    over courses offered here at Knorr and they shall be held to an oath of 
    trust. <br>
    <br>
    Rites shall indoctrinate any who advance beyond the rank of Initiate, and so 
    they will be able to alter the armor of the Hieromancer with an orb that 
    radiates pure light. With this they shall be tested as to their prowess, 
    those with lesser skill shall be known by the purity of their armor. Those 
    with greater skill will shine through the divine energy within, they shall 
    be known by the vibrancy of their auroric plate. <br>
    <br>
    They shall be trained in the truths passed from Adja, and my mother and 
    trusted with the knowledge of the corruption that bleeds into all aspects of 
    our society. <br>
    <br>
    If I am to leave a legacy upon this world, it will be one that recalls the 
    pure intentions of our once great race, before the time when avarice found 
    its way into our hearts from the depths of this world. It will be a 
    temper<span lang="en-us">a</span>nt and understanding society that maintains the order of the universe 
    by seeking out corruption and quas<span lang="en-us">h</span>ing it where it rises. <br>
    <br>
    The Light will have a champion.</font><p><span lang="en-us">
