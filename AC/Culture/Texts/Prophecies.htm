    Delacim, <br>
    <br>
    Should this have fallen into your hands then the curse that is my life is 
    over, and now the burden falls to you. I can only express my certainty that 
    you have earned the position that you will fulfill. You have proven to be 
    innovative and pure, the very same thing qualities that are necessary to 
    stand against the next sendings of Darkness. <br>
    <br>
    Once we were a noble race who did not war amongst ourselves, we lived in 
    tranquility and peace for millennia, but time has a way of dulling or 
    tarnishing the facts with the much of generations and stirring hate where 
    none once lay. I have lived lifetimes as you have learned. Those years 
    transpire and grow heavier upon my frame. Never had I thought a mother's 
    kiss could weigh so heavily on the heart of her child. <br>
    <br>
    I was chosen, as are you, to stand against the tide of Darkness. It has not 
    returned. It has been an Age since he who shall not be named was banished 
    from this world. If all goes well then this shall be the case forever more.
    <br>
    <br>
    I give you now the knowledge as it was handed to me, by those who remembered 
    the days before when we were still beings of purity and grace. <br>
    <br>
    This tale, a prophecy so named by my mother, was the last thing she spoke me 
    and the first thing I remember her ever telling me. I have spent many long 
    years in introspection upon her death thinking of another way that it could 
    have been, but it was to be this way and nothing could avert the fate of 
    that moment. <br>
    <br>
    As darkness draws about light <br>
    And all falls to ruin so shall come; the star. <br>
    The darkness will impart its wisdom, <br>
    And the Light shall lose its way. <br>
    And blackness shall fall across the land, <br>
    And the Light will be hidden above. <br>
    Then shall the light gain its wisdom <br>
    And Champion. <br>
    For Alaidain's blood shall be <br>
    The savior of the people <br>
    And then Darkness shall send again, <br>
    and be beaten <br>
    And so it will send again, <br>
    and be beaten. <br>
    <br>
    You see Delacim, it is a prophecy that stands in opposition to the curse of 
    Eibhiill, the curse placed upon the line of Alaidain. These words are 
    heresy, and must never reach Nali Valind or a fate similar to Ithaenc would 
    come to Knorr. Guard it well, commit it to memory and destroy every last 
    vestige of its writing. <br>
    <br>
    Adja, Light protect her, imparted this to me as well. It is a tale that she 
    said has been passed from the earliest generations of Empyrean, though it is 
    a tale that is not told by the church and is also heretical. <br>
    <br>
    There was but Light and Darkness; <br>
    And then Auberean. <br>
    Darkness sought to seed Auberean <br>
    And climbed within the world <br>
    As Light created guardians, <br>
    And sent them to defend. <br>
    Guardians made war <br>
    Against the darkness, <br>
    And the darkness drew forth defenders <br>
    From the land <br>
    To stand against the light, <br>
    And the Light called lesser children <br>
    To bear itself against Darkness. <br>
    And then the war was won. <br>
    <br>
    So the Darkness lay <br>
    Still and silent <br>
    But ne'er beaten by the bringers of Light <br>
    And so it called its children. <br>
    Not to make new war, <br>
    But to seed the soil with new treachery. <br>
    <br>
    And the Darkness reached out <br>
    And brought forth other worlds, <br>
    So too the Light. <br>
    E'er Auberean at the heart <br>
    Where ever shall rest the war. <br>
    <br>
    I have oft wondered at the truth of these words. As it would seem that there 
    is credence to be garnered by such a tale. Yet the evidence is thin at best. 
    But as I have lived I have seen the poison of the Darkness creep across this 
    world under the guise of avarice, greed, lust and power. I have witnessed 
    the Light used to persecute and destroy innocents, I have watched this all 
    for nearly 2000 years. <br>
    <br>

    been mystically etched.)</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">
