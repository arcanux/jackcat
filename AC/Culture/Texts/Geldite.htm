    <td valign="top" width="442"><em><font face="Arial"><small>Found on the corpse of a
    Gelidite Lord of Frore. Translated by Kuyiza bint Fuda of the Zaikhal Arcanum.</small></font></em><p><font face="Arial"><small>It has been a month since the first of the barbarians assaulted the
    gates -- a month of constant assaults and combat, with but a few hours of respite before
    the next wave threw itself at us. Most are berserkers, attacking with none of the finesse
    shown even by the Yalain, our old oppressors. They have little knowledge of magic beyond
    brute force. Yet many have shown the cunning and persistence of the rats that live in the
    tunnels below the city. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>After a thousand years of work -- ten thousand years of exile
    -- we are finished. The Council of Three, Blessed Fenngar, Ferundi, and Frisander, have
    been slain. Their bodies lie at the upper gates, battered and blistered to a final death
    by the barbarians. The outlanders swept through the tunnels, and Frore below, killing all
    the Initiates and Acolytes who dared oppose them, reducing our golem servants to rubble.
    The squares and passages are littered with corpses. We now have but a pitiful remnant of
    our forces. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>So many years we spent, weaving our spells around our Great
    Work, bending it to our needs. At last the heat of the deep earth was being drawn into it,
    contained. The world had cooled. Snow covered the deserts. Soon it would have been a
    frozen wasteland, suited only to ourselves. With all our enemies dead, we could finally
    return to Gelid. The Old Lords which revile us, the barbarians, the Olthoi . . . that
    idiot boy of Yalain sitting smug and aloof in his lofty fortress -- all would have passed
    into ice and memory. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>When the Work was assaulted, to our own surprise it defended
    itself like a living creature, casting flame spells of incredible strength. It slew many,
    drove the others back again and again, regenerating with astonishing speed. In the end,
    however, it was overwhelmed. The Great Work of Frore lies shattered, bleeding its warmth
    back into the undeserving earth. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>There is a darkness now where the Work fell. No matter how
    much light we place in the room, that spot remains dim and strange. I cannot explain it.
    Perhaps Frisirth, with his intuitive understanding of the Work, could have. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>How did we come to this? The ancient prophecies of the
    Falatacot said the Fourth Sending would begin in a city of Dericost named Frore. We were
    the nobility of High Gelid, Dericost's royal province. We established Frore to fulfill the
    prophecy, and extended our lives at terrible cost to buy the needed time. Yet we are
    broken, and the world recovers from our near-success. For this we fled the lands of the
    Yalain? For this we accepted the ritual of undeath, the burden of rotting flesh?<font color="#6B6B6B">S</font></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We have been our own gods. Perhaps the old gods have brought
    us low to teach us humility again. I mean the gods of the swamp and the deep earth, the
    true gods of terrible aspect who live in ageless splendor. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>These walls of stone and marble have long seemed to me an
    enclosing womb, protecting us from the unearned enemies we have suffered for millennia. We
    came here to build a holy city, from which we might return home in triumph after our long
    exile. Now, I look at the walls, and can only think of them cracking and crumbling,
    collapsing inward, burying us in the vault of eternity into which so many of the Old Lords
    were thrown. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I rest uneasy, when rest can be had. I feel cold. </small></font></td>
