    Entry 1<br>
    <br>
    This library proves to be an amazing source of knowledge. Though the 
    shifting staircases proved to be a conundrum when I first arrived, I have 
    now mastered the ascent and know each landing by rote. As I made my way to 
    the top, I discovered there were three sections to this library, and each 
    section seemed to be devoted to recording the rise of an Empyrean 
    civilization. The shelves within these sections are most disturbing, as it 
    seems each one contains a trapped soul. Were such an atrocity not of their 
    own doing, I would perhaps feel pity for them. However seeing as it likely 
    they were fully aware of the consequences, there is nothing within me that 
    would lend itself toward compassion.<br>
    <br>
    I have made a place for myself near the apex of the library proper. I found 
    a small room there that was comprised of little more than a set of candles, 
    a table, and a chair. From here I have begun to decipher the books that I 
    have found within this labyrinth of stairs. Amusingly the quill that I had 
    found and intended to use leapt from hand and began writing my thoughts 
    directly onto the page.<br>
    <br>
    It has taken some time to master the intricacies of writing in such a 
    fashion, but I think that my efforts have progressed well.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 2<br>
    <br>
    This citadel is alive with spirits of the fallen. It is a house of terror, a 
    tale told to scare children, yet is reality. However I know that I am too 
    pure, and I will be able to safeguard myself against the wails that cry out 
    in the night, sealing myself from the madness that would drive lesser men 
    insane. <br>
    <br>
    While I have established a study for myself in the library, I have made my 
    living quarters in a room at the top of the citadel. While this room is 
    simple in decoration, a vibrant energy fills it, giving the impression that 
    it must have been intended as a throne room. Also, like most other areas of 
    the citadel, is impossible large. Within I have begun arranging pedestals 
    and some other accoutrements to provide it with a feeling more akin to my 
    home. Eventually I intend to make this place my permanent home. <br>
    <br>
    However I first must continue to catalogue every document I find and begin 
    filling out reports that I will send to Emperor Kellin and provide copies of 
    to the Nali. <br>
    <br>
    Entry 3<br>
    <br>
    Blasphemers. One of the tainted shelves handed three books to me as I passed 
    close to it. Each contained rituals pertaining to blood sacrifice, and the 
    harvesting of organs for some foul and incomprehensible rites. While I read 
    them only to translate them, I still feel befouled in a sense. Such memories 
    and detail do not quickly leave your mind. <br>
    <br>
    Soon I must return to Aerlinthe. My brother will begin to worry if I have 
    not returned. There is still so much to study, but there will be other 
    times.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 4<br>
    <br>
    Finding the opportunity to leave the side of Asheron has proven difficult. 
    He has plans to send expeditions to another world. In the name of the 
    Emperor, why we do not simply take those we want and place them in cages is 
    beyond me. Asheron is too timid.<br>
    <br>
    Each day he makes my brother into something more like him, full of hope and 
    understanding. It sickens me.<br>
    <br>
    Although I am thankful to have this place to retire to, I hope that in time 
    I am able to learn what secrets lay within these walls and transfer them 
    into something more accessible. <br>
    <br>
    Upon my return I was met with a curious discovery. <br>
    <br>
    The three books of Falatacot design I had left on my desk were placed neatly 
    back into the shelves where they had been originally found. My inspection of 
    the area gave no trace of any other person's passage, so I can only assume 
    that the spirits that dwell within this place decided that they must act as 
    caretakers. Quite the oddity, perhaps I shall set a golem to watch the 
    goings-on here.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 5<br>
    <br>
    After the discovery of the other library on the mainland of Ireth Lassel, 
    this place has seemed pale by comparison. The tomes within this place are 
    mostly rote history, with no flare for originality. That was until today.<br>
    <br>
    When I arrived within the walls of the citadel this time, a most curious 
    sight met me. The stairs shifted as I entered the room, and I was forced to 
    relearn the passages toward the apex. The matter took no time, but it was as 
    though someone were watching my progress.<br>
    <br>
    I was also fortunate enough to find another section of shelving that 
    contained a companion set of books to those found within the library in the 
    mountains. These tomes each represented the different cults that had risen 
    and had recently been destroyed. On some pages it appeared as though the ink 
    was not fully dried. However upon investigation of the citadel, I saw no 
    sign of an intruder, owner, or thing that dwelled within these walls. Save 
    of course for the spirits that incessantly cry out for absolution, 
    forgiveness or assistance.<br>
    <br>
    Each book details a sect of the disciples of Blood in a little more detail. 
    They had codex and laws, and it appears as though they also had a governing 
    body. They strove for something pure, though undead. <br>
    <br>
    Often I have wondered why I have been so calm while investigating and 
    planning to put to use, rites and ideas given forth by undead. Each time I 
    introspectively examine the issue I am met with the same answer. I am not 
    them. I am given over unto the service of the Nali, and the Emperor of the 
    Cerulean throne.<br>
    <br>
    While the intentions of the undead are plainly the eradication of the Yalain 
    and Haebrous people, my cause is far tamer. Thus I am free of the taint that 
    they called upon themselves.<br>
    <br>
    With an elemental regime at the beck and call of the Emperor and Nali, there 
    will no longer be a need for these ludicrous explorations to other world. We 
    could simply halt the teaching of the Old Man and finally put an end to his 
    unnatural existence. <br>
    <br>
    If only the Emperor would give me leave to tell the Nali in the matter of 
    this truth, then we could focus more upon this discovery and less upon 
    watching Asheron. He grows tiresome, and knowing that some foul ritual like 
    those I found in the tomes from the Falatacot age fuel his existence makes 
    me feel unclean when in his presence. Things such as he are the reasons that 
    we fall into madness and lose sight of the true goals of our people. I have 
    heard the stories and read the tales of the Hopeslayer and his defeat, but 
    there is so much conjecture in the writing. He is the living breathing 
    anathema of an age that died centuries ago. <br>
    <br>
    Why should he live while others have perished?<br>
    <br>
    I am thankful that I have this place where I am allowed to express what true 
    feelings I have. Without such an outlet I would have earned the Emperor's 
    ire long ago. Instead I am given leave to traffic where I will and learn 
    what I wish.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 6<br>
    <br>
    It has been several months since my last stay within these walls. <br>
    <br>
    In those months my brother fell before the Olthoi, his lifeblood dripping 
    from the cruel pincer that protruded from his chest. Asheron's incompetence 
    called them upon our band and used his own student, my brother Delacim, to 
    avoid a death that should have rightly been his. As my bitterness has grown 
    so has my thirst for revenge. We have since made two more forays to the 
    world where the bug beasts came from, each yielding more captured members of 
    the species.<br>
    <br>
    Asheron survived one attempt on his life, but was met with imprisonment. <br>
    <br>
    The Lyceum at Knorr will still function but he will pay dearly for his 
    crimes. So the Emperor has stated.<br>
    <br>
    All the while, my research here continues. I have finally deciphered the 
    four books that were discovered in an earlier excursion. I have found that 
    each contains a piece of a larger puzzle. Coupled with the knowledge I took 
    from the library in the mountains I believe that I shall be able to 
    ascertain within a few years, if not months, the devices that will be needed 
    to activate the cisterns.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 7<br>
    <br>
    Four years have passed, but so little has been accomplished. Although I have 
    successfully placed the control crystals within each of the cistern cores, I 
    wasted too much time in developing golems that could withstand the extreme 
    climes that exist close to the blood of the world. In the end, I enchanted 
    the crystal itself, shaping it into a rough golem and commanding it to 
    perform the tasks that were necessary. Now the long wait begins. I shall 
    need to continue my efforts here.<br>
    <br>
    There must be anchors set in the citadel to draw upon the mana streams when 
    I have harnessed their energy. Then I will be able to set about finding the 
    remnants of the Disciples.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 8<br>
    <br>
    I have just returned from Tentael. The fool Asheron has failed more than any 
    could possibly know. I have been sequestered away with my work for so long 
    now that I was unawares at the vast passage of time.<br>
    <br>
    Apparently our last specimen, a hive queen, after healing from her wounds 
    began calling armies to aid her. The armies overran Knorr, pouring through a 
    gate that was left open by Asheron. The Emperor has grown soft without me, 
    for now he looks to Asheron for assistance. I was turned away from the 
    palace, as they were in council. My brooch was missing so there was little I 
    could do. No matter.<br>
    <br>
    My efforts continue here now, and the Emperor will know of me once again 
    when I step forth with an army that will quell the minor threat that the 
    Olthoi pose.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 9<br>
    <br>
    At long last I have completed preparations within the citadel itself. Four 
    new anchors have been placed within the hearth gems that line the outer 
    court. In the bowels of the citadel I have placed the memory stones that 
    hold a fragment of my consciousness so that I may see what transpires there.
    <br>
    <br>
    The shrines once dedicated to the dead that were buried within this place 
    have been converted into shrines dedicated to the elemental lords of Stasis, 
    Strife, Corrosion and Tempest.<br>
    <br>
    At their head I have placed myself, a commander that will use them as the 
    forward guard of the Cerulean Throne's armies.<br>
    <br>
    Very little remains to be completed now. A few more years and we shall end 
    the madness that Asheron has brought upon us.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 10<br>
    <br>
    Returning to this citadel was far easier then returning to my world. <br>
    <br>
    Yes dust has gathered and cobwebs have climbed into areas that were once 
    clear, but unlike so many other things, it is just as I remember it. The 
    wailing of the spirits here brings me a calm now and a remembrance of the 
    work I started long ago.<br>
    <br>
    The violet lights had come with no warning, streaming into the hall, 
    searching for me. Finally they found me and wrenched me from my work. My 
    thoughts in the years to follow were on Asheron and his greatest folly, for 
    he had interrupted the work that would have saved us all.<br>
    <br>
    Within the world between worlds, a constant scream and whine assaulted me. 
    While a lesser man would have been driven to the point of breaking, I had 
    fuel to keep me sane, a vision of a reckoning that must take place. I would 
    see Asheron kneel before me, begging for his life. I would pass my sword 
    through his neck and kick his head away. The noise became my comforter. It 
    meant that I was not dead, for if death was nothing more than that 
    wailing...Best not to think such things, I would rather spend an eternity as 
    an undead then face an eternity of a prison made of my own soul.<br>
    <br>
    How that creature that Isparian was able to tear me free of that place, I do 
    not know. I know only that there was a hum, an awakening and then a thinning 
    of a barrier. Like a small shadow cast from the man and I went toward it, 
    and fell into his world. At first I thought I was somewhere else, perhaps 
    even thrown into another time or reality. But I first felt the surge of the 
    world around me and as I stretched my consciousness toward the places where 
    I held sway, I knew that this was my world. Time had passed, but this was 
    still my home.<br>
    <br>
    I do not doubt for a moment that anything that the man could have done to me 
    I could not counter, but it was best to allay his fears and take certain 
    precautions to ensure that he did not overstep himself. I was after all 
    weary after the time spent in that formless realm. I wonder if my brethren 
    feel the same as I or if I was the only one to experience the scream of the 
    realm between worlds. <br>
    <br>
    Searching his mind uncovered hints of what had transpired. Asheron lived, 
    and this creature was an Isparian who went by the name of Martine.<br>
    <br>
    This Martine had lost some people dear to him and for this, he blamed 
    Asheron. He was a tool of the Virin'di, beings that lived within the world 
    between worlds, the realm that I had been freed from. I found their memories 
    mixed with the man's. I found their hatred and distrust for Asheron was 
    great indeed. They had never been defeated and so death was an uncommon 
    experience for them. When they arrived on my world, they were forced to take 
    forms they had never taken before, and Asheron had killed a great many of 
    them. They wished to take my world and take the nexus of power that I sense 
    deep in the earth below. <br>
    <br>
    This, Martine was built by them to try to understand and control power 
    similar to Asheron's. These Virin'di are an impudent race of creatures that 
    lacked foresight, but their tool would become mine. I set him on a course 
    that would lead him to strike Asheron down.<br>
    <br>
    Slowly I moved through this world, rebuilding my dominion one fragment at a 
    time. These pests were eager to assist me. They are easily distracted by 
    shiny trinkets and baubles that hold no true power.<br>
    <br>
    They are feeble, but among them then I found one that had taken up the 
    mantle of the Falatacot. She was devious and cruel, deserving of a most 
    severe punishment. So I set about finding her. She was easily found and, 
    with the assistance of one of Martine's minions, I have been able to lead 
    her to the library in the mountains. I go to greet her today.<br>
    <br>
    (Translator's Note: This account did not appear until brought near 
    candlelight. As I passed the pages closer to the flame they came into view. 
    I have taken the liberty of tracing them for you. It is unlikely that the 
    author realized it was penned.)<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Hello Nuhmudira.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She looks at me. While I expected fear, but I am met with rage. She 
    unleashes a barrage of some form of heiromancy. It is nothing compared to 
    the power I wield, but formidable for one of her race.<br>
    <br>
    As I raise my hand and wipe her spell away, she begins to utter phrases in 
    the Falatacot tongue. She crackles with energy, and I see that she has found 
    a way to circumvent her body's frailty and command these spells. I interrupt 
    her casting with an invisible barrier conjured from my mind. She flies from 
    her chair and lands in a crumpled heap.<br>
    <br>
    As I study her, I notice her hair is red. This is a surprise, for I had 
    expected to see the white that Kai had described. It is no matter, for as 
    she struggles to her feet, I motion with my hand, driving her against the 
    wall. Her bones snap and begin to liquefy. She stifles a scream for a moment 
    and then wails like the vermin she is. As I approach closer I smile. She 
    weeps.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Tut, tut Nuhmudira, you had to know that there would be a price for your 
    meddling. Fear not however. Your own people shall choose your fate. More or 
    less.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    She whimpers as I let her ruined body slump down off of the wall. I gesture 
    and the room is engulfed in flame.<br>
    <br>
    These books long ago became purposeless to me and their destruction will be 
    no great loss. Kai cries at the doorway until I command him to return to the 
    outer foyer, to welcome more…;guests.<br>
    <br>
    My golem scoops Nuhmudira from the ground. I set guardians in the library, 
    difficult but nothing that even the vermin that infest my world cannot 
    defeat. I want them to find her.<br>
    <br>
    I walk directly to the oubliette and have the golem enter.<br>
    <br>
    The moment it places her form on the top of the column, it crumples to the 
    ground. The draining has begun. It will take longer should people choose to 
    save her, but that divine torture is my reward for removing such a threat 
    from the world.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 11<br>
    <br>
    Years of planning have arrived at a vital crossroads. Martine is well 
    prepared and the High Queen of the land is sufficiently endeared to helping 
    her people. Asheron, so far as I know, is still very much unaware of my 
    existence here. Ireth Lassel begs for freedom. <br>
    <br>
    In the cisterns the pests have opened the stopgaps for me and the essence 
    flows. The bodies of Stasis, Strife, Corrosion and Tempest are forming.<br>
    <br>
    The power can no longer be contained within that tiny essence. Now they will 
    rise and serve their master, and then when the time is right, their forms 
    will weakened by the vermin. I will take them into the Elemental Hall and 
    draw them into the one that existed at the dawn of time.<br>
    <br>
    It shall use the body of Nuhmudira as a vessel, and then it shall walk the 
    world in my service. It is amusing that all my preparations have gone 
    unnoticed by the people Asheron thinks so highly of. A pathetic state of 
    affairs. <br>
    <br>
    To think that the Emperor believed that Asheron would be the salvation of 
    our race is laughable. His greatest spell locked us away in the world 
    between worlds. He is nothing more than a charlatan with a weakness to be 
    exploited by wretched creatures that would make better pets than masters of 
    this world.<br>
    <br>
    Entry 12<br>
    <br>
    She was not there. Everything was done as it was needed to be. The vessel 
    was prepared to perfection. The construct should have driven her memories 
    from her. <br>
    <br>
    It is unimaginable that her people could have decided to let the woman live. 
    Such pity is the thing of folly.<br>
    <br>
    Yet as I stood there in the swirling mist of raw essence, she was not to be 
    found. My summoning failed and the city above was cast into ruin. They are 
    coming for me now. I know they do, for my cisterns grow weaker. They are 
    shattering the cores. The cisterns have grown cold as the Harbinger slouches 
    up from its slumber. It slowly steals the essence from the world, striving 
    to build a form for itself.<br>
    <br>
    How could they have done this? Now we are all doomed. It will grow, and it 
    will manifest into a being that is like a god spoken of as founding this 
    world. There will be no force that will stand before it that will not fall. 
    Without a master, it will unravel this world.<br>
    <br>
    But I cannot leave here. I feel my powers dwindling, and the time is at hand 
    when I must enact the final rite. I will weaken in power but my body will 
    become a thing of legendary proportion. None will harm me.</font></small></td>
