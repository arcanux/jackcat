      *****<br>
      <br>
      He approached me as I was returning home to Eastham from Rithwic. Celcynd had been buying drinks for the whole house. It was a late
      night.<br>
      <br>
      From the forest shadows he called my name. I, a master of silence and
      stealth, knew when I was outclassed. I waited to see what he had to
      say.
      <br>
      He stepped from under the dark copse of trees. Taller than me,
      covered in a blue robe with a hood over his face. He approached me
      quickly and quietly, and I readied two of my blades underneath my
      jerkin. I would not go down easily.<br>
      <br>
      He stopped a few feet away. An odor of sea and death wafted across my
      nose. I had been to the sea once, after my first blade job some
      thirty years back, to avoid further complications. With the heaving
      and the smell, I had almost wished I had been caught and hanged. My
      grip on the daggers tightened.<br>
      <br>
      "Foolishness, piglet. I have lived for thousands of years. Your steel
      is soft next to me." His voice was smooth, and yet it managed to
      further stiffen my spine with every syllable. I belatedly realized I
      was terrified.<br>
      <br>
      "I have a proposition for you, Vinchlane. How I came to hear about
      you is unimportant. But for my purpose, it appears all paths lead to
      you. Amongst the outlanders that soil this land, I understand that
      you have no small skills in the art of locks and keys. True?"<br>
      <br>
      I nodded, cursing myself for my inability to speak. Many a strong and
      brave man had fell beneath my blade, yet here I was petrified by what
      I knew not. I had to content myself with my weak assent.<br>
      <br>
      "Ahh, good, Vinchlane. I am sure we can come to an understanding,
      then." He threw back his hood. I soiled myself, another thing I had
      not experienced since that first killing 30 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      *****<br>
      <br>
      He would not divulge his name, and I did not press. I did not need to
      put a name on the unspeakable. During our time over the next month he
      often would remind me of my mortality. But better far to die quick
      and clean than to live on in a manner such as that. Every step he
      took brought with that same stench of the wet blight. I would rather
      die a thousand times than have to carry around that with me for my
      immortal existence.
      <br>
      I would not have dealt with him at all, if it weren't for the money.<br>
      <br>
      An extremely large sum of money, more than I had ever earned for all
      my jobs on Ispar and Dereth combined. An almost unbelievable sum of
      money. It was the amount, actually, that led me to write this. I have
      been in the business of men buying my unsavory talents for a long
      time. When I am offered too much money for a job, it means one of two
      things, either the man plans on killing me after the job is done, or
      the man is a fool. This walking horror was no fool. And I did not
      think I could handle him trying to kill me the same way I handled it
      back on Ispar. I had not lived this long by courting suicide.<br>
      <br>
      What he wanted was not trivial, even for my talents. While I was
      primarily hired on Ispar for killing, I only took true pride in the
      manual arts of defeating the lock. No man on either of the worlds I
      have lived on were my equal in lockpicking. But never had I worked
      with what the Horror had created. "Mnemosynes" he called them. He was
      always arrogant and condescending, but never more so than when he
      talked about his precious Mnemosynes and how they would save the
      Dericost. I had no knowledge of who the Dericost were before I ran
      into the Horror, but my time with him was a rapid education.<br>
      <br>
      The Dericost were amassing for war. The Shadows were preparing to
      free Bael'Zharon, an occurence the Horror felt must be prevented at
      all costs. But there were worries amongst the undead that this
      upcoming war might come at a grievous price for the Dericost. Their
      society had endured for thousands of years, and much of their culture
      could be lost forever if they suffered too many losses. As the Horror
      told me one day, "Were your fledgling lives to vanish, not even worms
      would note your passing. But the Dericost were promised eternity. And
      eternity we shall have."<br>
      <br>
      I should have felt insulted, but I was too busy puzzling over the
      Mnemosynes. They truly were ingenious devices. And, unlike most of my
      jobs involving a lockpick, this time my task wasn't to crack open the
      Mnemosynes, but rather to figure out how to make sure no one else
      did. The Mnemosynes allowed the Dericost to record their thoughts and
      memories.<br>
      <br>
      While I was with him, the Horror occasionally had meetings with other
      horrors, talking about how they would distribute the Mnemosynes and
      the instructions on their use to the various Dericostians once the
      devices had been finished. Apparently the plan was that even should
      the Dericost suffer devastation during the looming war, whatever
      remnant survived would have access to the Dericostian heritage and
      lore. Access, that is, guarded by the Horror and his cronies. They
      seemed to think that was very important.<br>
      <br>
      Personally, I wouldn't have minded if the whole race disappeared into
      the hell from which they came. But as I said, it was a great deal of
      money.<br>
      <br>
      *****<br>
      <br>
      The Horror had known the broad outlines of how he wanted to construct
      the Mnemosynes' locking process for quite some time. He had created
      three different types of the Mnemosynes, as the Dericost varied
      widely in terms of their age and knowledge, and while some Dericost
      were worth the largest Mnemosynes that he had made, others "would
      contribute little more than your outlander race could," in his words.
      Because the larger Mnemosynes would be the most valuable, he knew he
      needed a way of making them especially difficult to unlock.<br>
      <br>
      The magical nature of the Mnemosynes and variations he desired in
      their locking mechanisms led him to look into the inert remnants of
      golems. He had been theorizing about "attuning" the various
      Mnemosynes to different types of golem hearts. These golem hearts
      would then function as keys. Of course, what good keys that
      any "fledgling" newly arrived in this world could obtain? This was
      the reason why he had contacted me. My task was to transform the
      golem hearts through a process that only he and I would know,
      changing the raw material into specific keys which could then be used
      on the Mnemosynes.<br>
      <br>
      He had already chosen the three types of hearts he wanted me to
      sculpt. Wood and metal and rock. My first step was to create a tool
      that would allow me to work with all three. Once I had finished
      crafting my instrument, then the real work began.<br>
      <br>
      *****<br>
      <br>
      Regardless of the fact that you are reading this, and I am therefore
      dead, do not think I was a stupid man. Had we met on Ispar, I very
      likely would have been the last thing that you didn't quite see. I
      have infiltrated palaces and slept with princesses, I have stolen
      diamonds and rubies, I have wiped more blood off of my blade than is
      contained in your body. I was a master, and you should respect that.
      The Horror never respected me, and although I may not be around to
      enjoy it, I wonder if he enjoyed the fruits of his betrayal?
      <br>
      I had insisted that I be allowed to work in private. He was convinced
      that I was sufficiently cowed by the implicit threat of his power not
      to try and disappear before I had completed the work. And well he
      should have been convinced, as I was utterly certain that should I
      try to back out of the deal, he or one of his minions would destroy
      me beyond the power of any lifestone to bring me back.<br>
      <br>
      But now that work is done. Three keys sit before me. Wood, copper,
      obsidian. Crafted to the not-quite best of my ability. My carving
      tool sits here too, possibly the finest work I have ever done. And
      the last piece, this book, written in front of the flickering
      firelight. Perhaps the last light and heat I shall know.<br>
      <br>
      I realize it is possible I am making too much of this. It is possible
      that I will deliver the keys and the tool, along with the knowledge
      necessary to carve other keys, and he will hand me the agreed upon
      sum. It is possible, but not likely. No.<br>
      <br>
      From here, I go to drop off the carving tool, this book, and a letter
      with an old friend of mine. I will give him instructions to release
      the tool and the book to the various destination towns throughout
      Dereth, should I not return on a daily basis to say hello. I will
      tell him to send the letter as well, and I will warn him not to tarry
      during the delivery, lest he see whom he delivers to.<br>
      <br>
      And from there, I will go to meet the Horror. I suspect he will let
      me live long enough to deliver the keys and the information on how to
      craft them. And so during that time I will explain the new
      complication in our relationship, and how only my continued survival
      insures that he, and he alone, will have the ability to safeguard the
      combined knowledge of untold years of Dericostian culture. Otherwise
      the length and breadth of us "piglets" will soon know the secrets of
      how to pillage the lost memories of a twice-dead people.
      <br>
      And I have purposefully made the keys in such a way that one only
      needs to be a talented lockpick artist to fashion the keys. Talented,
      but not a master.<br>
      <br>
      I have done all that I can to insure my survival.
      <br>
      And should I be wrong, should all my hedges and guesses and instincts
      come to naught, as one day they must, then will my letter go out. It
      goes to a man who is not quite a man anymore.<br>
      <br>
      Hamud is not the only Isparian who has given over to the Shadows, he
      is merely the most famous.<br>
      <br>
      And I am sure that this contact of mine will be quite happy to pass
      along to the Shadows the news that I have to give. The Horror and his
      assistants have talked much of what their battle plans will be during
      this upcoming war over the Shadow Lord. They have talked much and in
      detail. Details which I am sure will be interesting to the Shadow
      leaders.
      <br>
      I have no doubt of the puissance of the Horror and his fellow Undead,
      but I admit to a morbid curiosity at how he deals with an ambush of
      Shadows.<br>
      <br>
      And who knows? Maybe I will come back to read this note years hence
      and laugh at my foolish paranoia. Perhaps. It would be nice to think
      so.<br>
