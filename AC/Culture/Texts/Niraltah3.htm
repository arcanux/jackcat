    We have reacquired the book, though we are unsure why Torgluuk kept it on 
	his person for the past few days we are certain that he is unaware of our 
	tampering. Further translation is included in this missive.<br>

	The Sleeping One was still alone and though it had succeeded in bringing 
	life it had failed to create what it had wanted. There were no beings that 
	thought like it, could call to it or ask it for guidance. So it pulled two 
	seeds from the nether and planted each into the soil of the Bur. It watched 
	as the seeds grew into life and began to swim through the muck of the Bur 
	and then leap from the muck to the muloo or walk amongst the iallootu. 
	Brothers born of its flesh, the Fiazhat and the Burun.<br>
	<br>
	The Sleeping One was content and realized that it had drawn much of itself 
	to create this world. It felt the weight of its efforts and closed its eye. 
	Across the sky its brothers and sisters shown upon Bur and the scattered 
	remnants of its first attempts spun about as a reminder of its failure to 
	the growing brothers of Bur.<br>
	<br>
	In the dark Burun huddled together and supped on the fruits of the shuuktuuk, 
	they grew wiry and strong swimming through the muck and feeding on the moar, 
	bomutur and the bomuturs smaller offspring. The Fiazhat spread along the 
	solid ground, hunting moar and feeding from the iallootu.<br>
	<br>
	Burun grew more confident and curious. Spreading across the swamps and mire 
	into the lands where the iallootu grew tall and the land grew hard. But the 
	land was drier and their skin cracked and peeled away. The made their way 
	back to the comfort of the shuuktuuk and mucor where they ate and learned 
	the secrets of the past.<br>
	<br>
	Fiazhat slithered along the land where iallootu grow and made their way into 
	the mire and swamp to hunt the moar. They found the Burun and made 
	discourse. They refused the teachings of the mucor and reviled the scent of 
	the fungus. The fled the swamp and returned to their dry land. The Sleeping 
	One blinked furiously for eons. Time ever marched forward and the Burun and 
	Fiazhat came into contact no more. And then the time of harrowing began<br>
	<br>
	Fire rained from the sky and the second world of bur crumpled in the sky and 
	fell to the world of Bur. Fire leapt across the iallootu lands and scoured 
	the swamps. Burun and Fiazhat alike were drawn into the flames and devoured. 
	Death came at the hands of an unseen force. The Sleeping One had closed its 
	eyes and the world had caught ablaze. Fire scorched the world and all was 
	changed. The Sleeping One opened its eyes again to see usurpers.<br>
	<br>
	They arrived in the places where the Fiazhat supped on the land and grew 
	strong. Beings of twisted darkness, tall, lithe beings adorned in the flesh 
	of other beings, wrapped in cloth, adorned with emblems of life. Smelling of 
	blood and wearing paints crafted from the berries and mire of another place. 
	They came with promises and dreams that they used to bewitch the Fiazhat and 
	fill their heads with thoughts of their worlds.<br>
	<br>
	They blotted The Sleeping One from the sky with fell arts. Halo's of blue 
	light radiated about their forms and voices shrill and cruel sang loud 
	across the wasted, burning lands.<br>
	<br>
	Come. Come. The false gods begged of the Fiazhat. But Fiazhar brothers could 
	not see the lithe forms whose delicate faces were filled with wrath. Only 
	the mucor saw the truth and saw these forms, heard their songs and felt 
	their passage. So it was that the Burun knew of these beings, these false 
	ones.<br>
	<br>
	But the Fiazhat had heard the calls and during the cycles when The Sleeping 
	One's eye was hidden from the world. The Fiazhat built structures of 
	hardened sand, carved images in the stone and hissed and sang the songs of 
	the false beings. All this crept forward and grew for five thousand cycles.<br>
	<br>
	During that time the burning lands scoured the world and drew the swamp 
	homes of the Burun to near nothingness. When The Sleeping One saw the world 
	again, it wept and some of the mire returned. But five thousand years of 
	reverence had been stolen from The Sleeping One and its power was 
	diminished. Only the Burun recalled the truth, only they consumed the mucor.<br>
