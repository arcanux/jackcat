    <font size="2" face="Arial">Hibdin Velos was a stout man. Since his arrival 
    on Dereth his fondness for sweets had garnered him jowls and a round belly. 
    His hair was black and unwashed for many months. His eyes, a deep brown, 
    were set behind a low brow and weighted by countless sleepless nights. Those 
    who knew him in his early days on Dereth would no longer recognize him.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All his friends had long moved away from 
    Lytelthorpe, leaving him to speak with anyone kind enough to share a pint or 
    offer up a confection. It was not often that anyone visited him as his 
    stench drove most away. This day, however, brought a unique visitor, with an 
    even more unique proposal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A handful of pyreals scattered onto the 
    table, rousing him from an ale-induced dream. His vision swam under the 
    influence of the brew; images blurred and distorted before him. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Whadaya want. . .?” he slurred and wiped a 
    line of drool away with an unsteady hand. His head lolled from side to side 
    as he tried to focus on his visitor. The tavern was silent and empty of any 
    other forms. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You have lost your <i>hope</i>. I am here to 
    offer it anew.” The voice was calming, sure and in a sense, regal. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“. . . hope. . . that's a word without 
    meaning. . . chum. . .” he gurgled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I will give you hope.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bah!” he coughed, spattering the table with 
    phlegm. “There's nothing on this damn world but suffering.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I know too much of that. Take my hand and I 
    will make all well.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Weeping, he reached toward the image and fell 
    into blackness. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    Six months prior he had been a mess, nothing more than a human husk wasting 
    his life away at the bottom of a fermented bottle. Now he had purpose, and 
    drive. His master was a good man, brutal but good. If you performed your 
    duties you were rewarded, fail in them and you suffered so that you never 
    forgot that failure. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hibdin had never failed his master and he was 
    not about to now. He looked at his companion Blaylock, a scrawny man also of 
    Aluvian descent, and shook his head. Blaylock was a quivering mass of badly 
    constructed bones. At the moment his eyes were wide as saucers, like those 
    of a rabbit about to be skinned alive. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He had been found alone in the wilderness, 
    starving and half mad. The master had freed him as well, placing him in 
    Hibdin's charge. They were on a mission this day, important enough to 
    entrust Hibdin to the cause. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The master wanted Mattekar specimens. He 
    wanted <i>variety</i>, not only those that roamed in the northlands of Marae 
    Lassel. He wanted the lowliest and the greatest alike. He had dispatched the 
    two men into the wilderness to garner the specimens. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They were armed as always in light armor with 
    their weapons of choice. Additionally they carried with them restraining 
    fields forged from the energy of portal space, a gift from the master.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They arrived in Mayoi and made their way into 
    the mountains beneath the cover of the twin moons. They took pains to avoid 
    other creatures that made the mountains their home, and scoured the valley 
    and surrounding mountains for signs of Mattekar. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nothing. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blaylock shivered in the brisk mountain wind. 
    Something was dreadfully wrong and the smaller man was acutely aware of it. 
    His teeth chattered, grating on Hibdin's nerves. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Stop it, Blaylock,” Hibdin snapped. The 
    trail of air from his lungs floated upward like a beautiful ribbon, 
    disappearing into a dark crevice above. His foul smell breath smelled like 
    day-old fish stew and molded bread. “If there are any Mattekar here, you're 
    sure to alert them. . . you simpering wad. The mast--” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sharp expulsion of warm air flowed over him 
    like a waterfall, breaking his concentration. Blaylock's eyes grew wider as 
    they reflected the face of the horned beast with heavy white fur. In an 
    instant Hibdin was tumbling away from the Mattekar, avoiding its gnashing 
    jaws. Blaylock was not so lucky. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Its teeth sunk into his shoulder and clamped 
    tightly, crumpling a lung and splintering a bone within his arm. His scream, 
    cut short, was replaced by a heavy wheeze-gurgle, as blood filled his 
    punctured lung. Red blood stained the white snow. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blaylock pulled his mace free and dropped the 
    flame-coated head against the creature's skull. With a growling yelp it 
    turned to face him, and Blaylock collapsed to the snow-covered ledge. Hibdin 
    twisted aside the great beast's gore and freed his shield. Blaylock freed an 
    orb and sputtered a healing phrase, mending twisted bone and ruined flesh. 
    He breathed deeply as a torrent of Hibdin's blows rained into the beast. It 
    reeled and stumbled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Throw the field!” he bellowed as he slammed 
    his shield into the Mattekar's front flank and leveled another blow against 
    its head. Blaylock fumbled with the device and nearly triggered it on 
    himself. “Hurry, you sod!” Another gore from the Mattekar slid along his 
    shield. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Got it!” Blaylock shrieked as the little box 
    began to pulse with violet light. Hearing this, Hibdin fell flat to the 
    ground. Blaylock launched the cube at the beast and hit his mark. A warble 
    in space, accompanied by a hum and heartbeat, pulled the Great Mattekar 
    within. Blaylock and Hibdin breathed heavy. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“One down.” Hibdin chuckled and patted his 
    companion on the shoulder. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blaylock managed a meek smile. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    On the desert plains the two watched as a White and Snowy Mattekar collapsed 
    due to exhaustion in the sweltering sun. Far removed from their native 
    mountain perches, these were captured without much difficulty. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, too, were the Dire and Dread Mattekar in 
    the mountains south of Qalaba'r. Hibdin and Blaylock enjoyed the benefit of 
    surprise. They prepared well and enchanted the beasts with spells of 
    vulnerability to weaken them. Again the devices hummed to life and swallowed 
    the creatures, trapping them inside. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They traveled north through the city of Newic 
    and glowered briefly at the man standing near the crater. He burst into 
    tears and the men felt compelled to issue orders to him. He whimpered and 
    acquiesced with a simple, “I will obey.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They turned east and avoided contact with 
    other Isparians that were about, careful not to draw attention. The master 
    had ordered them to be silent and so they were. A small house poured warm 
    smoke into the winter air by the portal northward. Here the men prepared for 
    the last task set before them. Once it was complete, they would return to 
    the master and give him what he desired. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Through the mountainous shortcut and over the 
    top peaks of the northern range they traveled and found the solitary, shaggy 
    beast. It stood as tall as the both of them together and was the length of 
    two cows. The Canescent on Marae Lassel was a large caste but this one, the 
    Hoary, was enormous. The caste had been thought extinct, hunted for their 
    thick hides some two years before. But the master was wise and knew where 
    this one remained. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blaylock whimpered at the sight of the 
    behemoth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Quiet, you fool! You'll make us known.” 
    Hibdin hissed through clenched teeth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I can't, Hibdin, I can't.” Blaylock moaned 
    and fell to his knees. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You must and you will, I'll not be forced to 
    face the master's wrath because of your incompetence. I am Hibdin Velos and 
    the master trusts me above all others.” He lifted the smaller man up by his 
    shoulders. “He wishes to test these creatures and we will not fail him. They 
    are just beasts. . . nothing more.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“They are something more, or will be should 
    we give them over to the master. . .” Blaylock sputtered, his tears frozen 
    on his cheeks. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Simpering, nothing!” He struck Blaylock hard 
    with the back of his hand. “How dare you question the master? He who brought 
    you from the darkness.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hibdin, look at it. . . it's so big, so 
    strong.” A welt swelled beneath his eye, tear welled. “What will he make 
    them?” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“We are here under orders, and will not fail 
    the master. I will not question what he orders, nor will you or I will send 
    you back to him. Now quiet your tears and prepare a creature for capture.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blaylock crumbled, his will broken by 
    Hibdin's forceful words and ominous presence. He summoned forth magic to 
    weaken the beast as Hibdin slipped free his flaming mace and shield that 
    pulsed with soft magic. He engaged to deter the beast's movement. Blaylock 
    activated the cube and prepared his throw. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hibdin slipped on the snow and screamed as 
    his knee twisted sideways. The Hoary shredded his armor and tore a chunk of 
    flesh from his back. Blaylock gasped and dropped the device onto his foot. 
    The air churned with the hum of portal space and the sound of a singular 
    heartbeat. Blaylock was gone. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The beast reared and slammed its horns into 
    the reeling Hibdin. Horns puncture flesh and drove through him. Hibdin 
    screamed in agony and called for aid. His bellow was met by silence. He 
    struggled away, pulling at the snow to drag him away from the beast. The hum 
    returned, growing more violent as the seconds passed. The beast turned 
    toward the noise, distracted by the growing hum. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A violet glow formed where Blaylock once 
    stood, a rift torn in fabric of portal space. Sharp sounds like the snapping 
    of bones or pockets of water boiling out in a fire came from within the 
    swirl. The beast remained distracted long enough for Hibdin to quaff elixirs 
    to mend his wounds. He activated his own device and tossed it at the beast.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The device struck the beast and swallowed it 
    whole, but the heartbeat pop was overpowered by the growing sound of the 
    portal. Essence from another world thrusting through the gaping maw of the 
    swirl flooded over Hibdin and washed him in an arctic chill. His eyes 
    slammed shut and he lowered his head to keep his footing. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As quickly as it had poured through the space 
    between worlds it was gone; Hibdin was left alone again in silence. All 
    about him, Mattekars the size of small houses stood bewildered. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He collected the soft pulsing device and 
    tossed it into his pack. He scampered over the edge of the mountain and 
    watched from a distance as the newly arrived Hoary Mattekars shook off the 
    effects of their sudden transport. In the snow in the center of the small 
    herd a singular pulsing orb remained. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Sorry, Blaylock,” he muttered. Hibdin had 
    never failed his master. He sheathed his weapon and secured his packs, and 
    returned home.<br>
