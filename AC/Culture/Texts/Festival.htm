    <td valign="top" width="441"><font face="Arial"><small>I, Alatar Locke, have traveled far
    over these lands called Dereth. Here I provide a simple guide to the ruins called the
    Festival Stones, the twenty tall pillars scattered across the face of Dereth, adorned with
    roiling blue magic. I judge them to be relics of the late High Empyrean culture; perhaps
    they are markers of seasonal celebrations. In any case, the search for all twenty is a
    taxing endeavor, which only the strongest can endure, and for such have I written.<br>
    <br>
    The less-educated minds of Dereth have taken to referring to these relics by the Old
    Roulean months and hours, so I shall use those crude, commonly known names within this
    guide:<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Morningthaw lies to the southeast of the Aluvian river-town of Rithwic, near
    53.3E, 33.3N.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Solclaim lies in the parched wastelands to the east of Al-Arqas, near 16.5E,
    31.5S. This, of course, supports my theory that the desert was once lush and fertile.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Seedsow can be found in the woods to the west of the fortress of Lytelthorpe.
    Look near 46.1E, 0.5N.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Leafdawning is hidden in a small grove of trees near 54.1E, 10.1N. This
    Stone, to the west of Rithwic, is ringed by Empyrean statues.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Verdantine stands tall over the road leading southwest out of Samsur, near
    15.7E, 3.5S.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Thistledown overlooks Cragstone Falls from the western bank, near 42.9E,
    27.7N. Obviously, the Empyrean appreciated the magnificence of the view. I am reassured of
    their aesthetic sense.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Harvestgain is near the Gharn'n town of Uziz, near 29.3E, 27.5S.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Leafcull, lies west of Yanshi, near 42.9E, 13.1S. This Stone appears in the
    bare grasslands, and even the most inept should be able to find it.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Frostfell stands in the Stonehold Valley, far beyod the northwest reaches of
    the Tiofor of Wood; 15.1W, 69.3N. There is a minor peasant community nearby.<font color="#6B6B6B">SUCKS</font><br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Snowreap is tucked away in the caldera of the great volcano we call Mount
    Espar, at 13.3E, 65.3N. Judging by the ruins found at this location, it was once a sizable
    Empyrean town. I theorize that the Empyrean refined Pyreal in the fiery core of Mount
    Espar, but of this I have as yet no evidence.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Coldeve awaits the bold at 48.5E, 83.5S, near a town of little importance.
    This Stone rests upon a cliff, overlooking a magnificent channel which leads in from the
    sea.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Wintersebb is on a rise east of Qalaba'r, near 21.3E, 74.7S.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Dawnsong overlooks the southern oceans near 44.3W, 89.9S. This stone is at
    the tip of a long, narrow peninsula, between two islands. Alas, even I could not find a
    place to scale the sheer cliffs of the island.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Morntide overlooks the surrounding plains from a hill west of Nanto's Blue
    Ghost Falls, near 78.1E, 53.1S.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Midsong can be found, most appropriately, at the center of Dereth, near 0.0W
    by 0.0S.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Warmtide is part of the ruined Inner Sea port across the Yaraq Cove, near
    5.1W, 21.1S. These ruins have a reputation that only grows more evil with the passing of
    time.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Evensong guards the shore of the river we call Prosper, near Holtburg at
    36.5E, 42.1N. This stone seems to lie near the end of the ruins of a temple complex built
    over the river. The presence of a monolithic head statue suggests that this was not a
    temple in the favor of the High Empyrean -- but that is a lesson for another day.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Gloaming lies at approximately 70.7W, 4.3S. This stone lies within the heart
    of the Direlands, and we can only speculate what those lands may have been like long ago.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Darktide can be found upon a small islet near 90.7W, 60.3S. I would suggest
    that this was once near a port of some sort, since fallen to ruin. Perhaps this stone was
    erected for festivals to appease the forces of the sea and sky.<br>
    <br>
    The Stone of Foredawn lies east of Shoushi, near 75.5E, 33.9S. This Stone appears to be
    the only one whose attendant temple facilities have survived the depredations of time.<br>
