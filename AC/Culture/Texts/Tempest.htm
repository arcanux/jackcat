    There is much to be said for energy and the correlation to treachery. There 
    is also much to be said for intelligence and the application of that 
    intelligence into something that leads to greatness. <br>
    <br>
    Our nearest failure in eradicating the Disciples came at the hands of those 
    sworn to Tempest. This tome holds their accomplishments, and ultimate 
    failure, as well as the names of the heretical Ministers. <br>
    <br>
    They are no more, and these personal tomes serve as the only living memory 
    of their existence. <br>
    <br>
    Within the walls of my home shall these books remain, until such a time that 
    they are no longer necessary as a - (Translator note: Whether this area is 
    an omission or another in the strange oddities that I have found throughout 
    these tomes I do not know. Regardless it can be seen as how one would not 
    see the warnings that are presented herein.) <br>
    <br>
    Discoveries of the Blessed Tempest <br>
    <br>
    I, Millakt, Minister Supreme of the Disciples of the Blood place pen to 
    parchment to record the discoveries of our people. I endeavor to educate 
    those that will follow in our place and join us as we move toward the 
    eradication of unbelievers in our midst, and in our way. We have, with the 
    assistance of each branch of the Disciples, sequestered the way of 
    Heiromancy into base forms that stem from a greater whole to achieve a new 
    and advanced form of magic. <br>
    <br>
    Let the Yalaini steward who lives by way of tragic irony have his 
    understanding of the well between worlds. We shall be content to dominate 
    this one and alleviate the burden of living beings upon it. We understand 
    control now, and can endure the sundering of souls and minds. The treachery 
    of the Master is a thing of the past, and we shall use our new found 
    understanding to instead enslave him and his. <br>
    <br>
    Soul Channeling <br>
    <br>
    Through practice of advanced techniques involving higher thought we have 
    sequestered the memories into a palpable form that allows transfer from a 
    subject into a receptacle. Thus far the only receptacles that are suitable 
    come in the form of prisms that grow from the earth near places where the 
    Blood flows greatest. <br>
    <br>
    By the sacrifice of some of our number we have been able to solidify the 
    thoughts of those sacrificed. <br>
    <br>
    Their spirits live on in the form of thin tendril of energy that are 
    connected to the prisms and to a central column constructed of pyreal. When 
    an entity is place upon the apex of the column over time the fleeting 
    memories that the soul requires to remain anchored to the flesh body are 
    removed and stored within the bounds of the prism. <br>
    <br>
    A deeper understanding of the dynamics of crystals may well be necessary. 
    But the rudiments are simple. Crystals live, though their life force is 
    different than any other thing. Their lives are measured in the amount of 
    energy that they contain. <br>
    <br>
    When one undergoes the process to anchor the soul to a body that will not 
    decay they remove the life force from the self but leave the energy, and 
    essence of themselves behind, within the vessel. <br>
    <br>
    The Falatacot never underwent the transformation, or if they did they never 
    explained the rigors of this process. Though, I believe that they never 
    partook in the atrocity of undeath. They were a dark folk but it is unlikely 
    that they, who seemed so conscious of both body and soul, would have given 
    up their very souls to see that their bodies would live on. <br>
    <br>
    Being threatened with extinction changes your view slightly and so when we 
    heeded the Master's call we cared very little about consequence and focused 
    more upon the immediate benefit. Eternity is forever. This is not a 
    misnomer. It is a misdirection. <br>
    <br>
    Those whose will was strong in life are able to cling with more tenacity to 
    their whole essence while those that struggled through their existence in 
    life are torn asunder and scattered. They leave behind the trappings of 
    mortal life, understanding, knowledge, intelligence, and replace it with the 
    physical form that is truly undying. <br>
    <br>
    But that remnant of the self is lost to echo for eternity upon the wind, in 
    the soil, in the halls where they walked. <br>
    <br>
    I have watched the sad transformation of many of our people and each death 
    from undeath has made me fear more that I would one day succumb to the rigor 
    of death. And there caught inside the savagery of eternal torment I have 
    thought that I would lose my last vestige of self and be torn away from the 
    one thing that made me unique. No longer. <br>
    <br>
    The where by and what for remains a mystery but we know that the process 
    works, and can be reversed. As long as the subject is a learned scholar of 
    the magic of the mind they are able to transfer their consciousness into 
    such a receptacle and have access to the memories when need be. <br>
    <br>
    This, our first finding is the most glorious and the one that shall be most 
    coveted by our enemies. <br>
    <br>
    Heiromantic Solidification <br>
    <br>
    As children we were taught of the 6 elements of the world, and how they came 
    to be corrupted or changed. How water and wind were replaced by the frozen 
    tundra and the poison. We know how light and dark battle endlessly as 
    elements opposed with neither being the greater power. We know that there is 
    nothing in this world that is not a shade of both combined, just leaning a 
    little more toward the other. <br>
    <br>
    We are taught to command them if we wish to command the Heiromantic arts, 
    and given the tools early on to partake in the most brutal and grueling of 
    the magical arts. But we are not told of where the power that flows through 
    you to perform the art comes from. <br>
    <br>
    We know inherently that these strengths are bound to the world, irrevocably, 
    and completely. There are ancient maps that we can study that show the 
    places where the power ebbs more strongly. <br>
    <br>
    How the moons pull the tides of this power and how the trees grow away from 
    them, but we are never given the complete view of the truth. Only the 
    fragments that have been passed through generations of our peoples pass 
    through wives tales and are taught from elder to elder, and so forth. Thus 
    many of the truths are lost to time and superstition and omission, perhaps 
    malice has a play. <br>
    <br>
    But there are six. They were once one. They have been altered several times 
    over if our study is correct. <br>
    <br>
    Our brother-sister-kin the Falatacot heard the voice of the all and built 
    their empire upon its Blood and the blood of those that would give 
    themselves to the power that is. But they were not tempered and so fell 
    closer to the shadow. Thus they were abandoned by the light until they 
    happened upon us. We are tempered by the light and revolt against the 
    shadow, but there is something more to those of use that have studied the 
    symbols of the past. We know that the 6 were once 4 and that the 4 were once 
    one. Thus we have begun our exploration. <br>
    <br>
    There are lines of power that run across this world, and all draw taught 
    across a tiny shelf of land here at the North, near the lost lands. Here is 
    where a critical balance has been struck and the cords that bind the world 
    of magic have been fastened to the world. It stands to reason then that this 
    is the place where have been drawn. <br>
    <br>
    In an era predating the Falatacot, something, or someone built tiny shrines 
    to these places of power. They exist today as relics from the past etched 
    permanently on the landscape. <br>
    <br>
    We have begun to map them and at the same moment entrenched ourselves in the 
    study of solidification to better grasp what it is we are attempting to do.
    <br>
    <br>
    A minor discovery by me, showed that we could remove a portion of the 
    essence from the whole and keep it &quot;alive&quot; long enough to &quot;feed&quot; it a 
    portion of memories. It would then gain a modicum of sentience and react to 
    the person that summoned it forth. <br>
    <br>
    At first there was no practical application for such but soon we realized 
    that if we were sworn to an aspect of the existing elements we would be able 
    to draw enough of the Blood into a form that would be the epitome of that 
    element and thus draw one step closer to achieving the goal of giving rise 
    the oldest being that this world has known. <br>
    <br>
    Our efforts have proven somewhat successful though the altered aspects of 
    the elements have proven unstable and difficult to work with. But we are 
    perfecting our ability more with each day. <br>
    <br>
    Soon we shall have mastered the summoning of these beings and use them as we 
    use golems, and the effect will be less costly. For while you have attuned 
    your spirit to such a being you may use it to sense what lies around it, 
    thus they are a nearly imperceptible scout force. <br>
    <br>
    The Master shall not know of these, and the Yalain will be powerless to stop 
    us. <br>
    <br>
    Millakt, Minister Supreme of the Disciples of the Blood <br>
    <br>
    (Translator Note: The voice shifts here.) <br>
    <br>
    Remarkable, they thought they could keep their findings hidden from me. More 
    remarkable still was that they were able to evade discovery for so long. But 
    in the end, they proved to be little more than flies easily swatted away.
    <br>
    <br>
    Millakt, to his credit, did not divulge the secrets that he had written. 
    Instead they were torn from him, by the same mechanisms he meant to keep 
    hidden from me. We have refined the process now, and several have begun to 
    store their memories <br>
    <br>
    within mnemosynes. Tiny boxes created for the specific purpose of 
    harvesting. Of course they are collected, and put in a place of safe 
    keeping. <br>
    <br>
    The threat is ended. There will be no more revolts. I will lead my people, 
    and they will bend to my will.
