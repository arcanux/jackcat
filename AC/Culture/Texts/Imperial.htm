    Rhethis Eipoth 371 </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>To Maila, Mistress of the Lyceum of Knorr </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We fear that unpleasant news provokes Us to send thee this
    missive, Lady. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>As thee well know, We were compelled to send forth thy
    husband, the honored Lord Atlan of Knorr, to Our mainland realms of Nesortania and
    Glystaene, there to deal with certain disturbing events which vex Our citizens in the
    north. We have been receiving regular reports from the field, as We are aware that thee
    have been receiving reports of a more personal nature. These dispatches ceased without
    explanation four weeks ago. </small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>This very morning We did entertain at Our court a young man
    in shocking condition, who bore Us troubling news. This man was known to Us as Ihdare
    Kelderam, squire to thy Lord Atlan. He was bloodied and soiled, and nearly mad with a dark
    fear which seemed to possess him entirely. He did come before Our august throne atremble,
    there to tell a tale which We would think unbelievable, were it not for the reports which
    brought thy husband to the north.<font color="#6B6B6B">KS</font></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>He did say that on the fifty-second day of the march, Lord
    Atlan's army entered the Valley of Tresimaen, in the former lands of Dericost. Upon
    ascending the heights, a most notable phenomenon was witnessed by the assembled host. The
    entire valley floor, from the town of Cannthalo in the northeast to the peak of Zemal in
    the southwest, was enfolded in a darkness most unnatural. Though the sun shone but
    slightly past its apex, Tresimaen seemed to cup shadow as if it were water. Only a few
    tall trees could be seen rising clear of the pitch, from which angry whispers seemed to
    issue forth. At this spectacle, the host became unnerved. Atlan bade the army march back
    out of the valley, to make camp on the plain below. There he set a strong watch and lit
    bonfires. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Squire Kelderam's tale became disjointed at this point, We
    regret to say. As the night progressed, she claims the moons and stars faded and went out.
    By the time Alb'arel was to have risen, the watchfires on the northern perimeter began to
    struggle and die, as if damped by an unseen hand. He claims that insubstantial patches of
    darkness, like black fog, flowed through the camp. The boy described it to Us as &#147;a
    mist which ate light.&#148; Bleak laughter and whispering could be heard from all
    quarters. Atlan roused the chevairds and soldiers of the army at once, with cries that
    they were besieged. Yet, no enemy could be seen. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Kelderam then tells Us that the black mist did coalesce
    before Lord Atlan. The torso of a man, trailing off into insubstantiality at the waist,
    formed. A cluster of smaller forms, solid and giggling like mad children, stepped out of
    the roiling darkness behind it. These appeared as full-bodied boys and girls. The large
    being did point to Atlan, and say something in a language Kelderam did not recognize.
    Thereupon the small forms rushed to attack thy husband with fists and feet, and the Lord
    was obliged to defend himself with the sword Rez'arel. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The squire saith that Atlan smote all sent against him, as
    the army was cut down around him. Screams were heard, and men and women disappeared in
    scores, nought to be seen again. Only Atlan held fast, the fiery light of Rez'arel holding
    the shadows at bay. Kelderam stayed by thy Lord's side for some time, I gather, until a
    hoarse roar was heard in the unnatural dark. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>At this the girl broke down entirely at Our feet, and could
    only scream of a black winged form, whose horrible eyes drove her to flee in terror. Lady
    Maila, We are saddened to admit that Lord Atlan's fate seems bleak. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>There is a darkness in this girl's mind, Lady. It is not
    within the power of a sovereign to order it out. Therefore, We have commended her to the
    care of the Elders of the great cathedral on far Ithaenc. We have sent lone riders north
    to investigate further, in the hope that one or two may evade notice where a legion did
    not. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We know of but one survivor of almost twenty thousands. This
    is an unnatural magic, of a sort not seen since Our ancestors resisted the vile intentions
    of old Dericost. Our entire northern army has disappeared into the night. This distresses
    Us mightily. Rest assured We will do all in Our power to avenge the loss of Atlan, who was
    Our friend, cousin, and most trusted captain. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>As ever, We remain at your disposal. If We may be of any
    comfort to thy Ladyship, do not hesitate to seek Us. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Yours in sympathy, </small></font></p>
