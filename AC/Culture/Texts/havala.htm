	<font size="2" face="Arial">All my life, both in my homeland of Gharu'n and 
	here on Dereth, I have been a hunter. It is a calling that was passed to me 
	by my father. Even with other plentiful sources of food and livelihood, I 
	choose to hunt to support myself because it makes me feel connected to the 
	rhythms of the world. And while I respect the power and precision of bows 
	and crossbows, I feel most satisfied when I use the elegant and deadly 
	atlatl as my hunting weapon. To that end, not long after I came to Dereth, I 
	decided I would try to duplicate the successes Master Yuan Hanzu achieved 
	with his creation of composite bows from animal components available on 
	Dereth.<br>
	<br>
	I spent several years stalking the length and breadth of the island, 
	experimenting with different materials and techniques. Now I believe I have 
	achieved a useful solution that any properly-trained adventurer can 
	replicate. I have also developed high effective experimental handles to 
	greatly improve the power of these composite atlatls. The techniques of 
	crafting these handles are too complex for the average adventurer, but I 
	will discuss that below, after detailing the creation process of the basic 
	atlatl.<br>
	<br>
	First, I have determined that of all the horn-based ingredients Master Yuan 
	Hanzu prescribes, only the horns of the Great Mattekar will suffice for our 
	purposes. The carving of a horn is very tricky and should not be left to 
	amateurs. Simply bring me any Great Mattekar horns you find and I will carve 
	it as necessary for you. Two carved horns are required to construct a proper 
	Composite Atlatl. Each horn must be covered with a single piece of Cured 
	Lugian Sinew, which is another ingredient common to Master Hanzu's bows.<br>
	<br>
	Once the sinews have been stretched over the horns to create a pair of 
	Composite Atlatl arms, you must lock the arms together to create a Composite 
	Atlatl Stave. This gives the atlatl its basic shape. But a stave alone is 
	not sufficient! It must be treated with a generous coating of oil. For our 
	purposes, only oil squeezed from a Grievver Spike will do. I recommend using 
	a metal press to get the oil you need. It takes three Grievver Spikes to 
	create the necessary amount of oil.<br>
	<br>
	Once the Grievver Spike Oil has been thoroughly applied to the Stave, your 
	task is almost done. All that remains is to craft a handle for the atlatl. 
	Without a handle, this design will be useless as a weapon of war. A basic 
	handle can be whittled from the thighbone of a Dark Revenant, much like the 
	technique employed by Master Hanzu's disciples. The only difference is that 
	a Carving Knife is much more suited to this task than the Whittling Knife 
	that Master Hanzu suggested. A skilled fletcher with a Carving Knife should 
	be able to accomplish the task without significant trouble.<br>
	<br>
	Once the handle has been carved from bone, a person skilled in the art of 
	thrown weapons should be able to attach the handle to without much trouble. 
	Adding the handle to the assembly results in a simple and elegant weapon. As 
	in all things, there is always room for improvement. As I mentioned above, I 
	have developed some experimental techniques, using more exotic bones, to 
	create different designs of handles. These techniques are too intricate for 
	me to share with the public at large.<br>
	<br>
	Of course, with the simple expedient of a Whittling Knife, anyone can remove 
	the handle they've already placed on their atlatl. But to fashion new and 
	improved handles, as I said, will require expertise that I alone possess. 
	Suffice it to say that if anyone who has assembled his or her own atlatl 
	according to these instructions wishes to upgrade their weapon with a better 
	handle, simply seek me out in Ayan Baqur and I shall help. It may require 
	you to do some hunting in dangerous locations, but anything that is 
	worthwhile comes with risk...</font></p>
