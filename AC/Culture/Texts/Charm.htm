    <p><font face="arial" size="2">He means to seal me within this place for 
    eternity. How could I have been so blind. <br>
    <br>
    The Heat...the sting...the charge...the cold. All these things he has 
    surrounded me with, but I have this one, chance.<br>
    <br>
    There is a portal, here. I remember that, and a dias<span lang="en-us"> 
    [sic]</span>. A base, lectern something that infuses the key to passing the 
    portal, and coming here.<br>
    <br>
    So I shall begin the work upon a spell to weave the passage through for any 
    that find these pages.<br>
    <br>
    A lesson is learned as the pain begins to spread through me. Never 
    trust...anyone other than yourself. He thinks that I will shrivel so quickly 
    within this cell. <br>
    <br>
    I have found enough wood within this place to fashion a golem that will do 
    my bidding, but I cannot find a way from this room, and with the passage of 
    each hour it appears as though more of my power, and energy are taken from 
    me. I will hold out for a while, of that I am sure. Yet these writings must 
    taper into the spell that must be wrought.<br>
    <br>
    She collects the red hair, turning white, from her head. Twisting, 
    tightening, tying frayed end to frayed end in tedious precision, strand by 
    strand. The pain must be felt in order for the magic to take hold. <br>
    <br>
    Fortune smiled on her, in this her darkest hour. A dagger fit with the 
    sluice to draw the blood from her vein to etch the sigils and infuse the 
    page with magics beyond the scope of most understanding. Breathe controlled 
    by temperance, as each strand is manipulated closer and tighter into the 
    form of a makeshift brush.<br>
    <br>
    Her hand cups to pool the blood. Her fingers twist the braided strands of 
    hair fashioning a point to make the writing and etching precise.<br>
    The first touch of the stylus to the blood, is met with the exhale of 
    breath. A single word spoken, in a language, that only a few understand. The 
    brush grows saturated with the red, and is placed to the first parchment.
    <br>
    A single line, etched, horizontal. A first diagonal, another word. Care must 
    be taken to not use too much of the precious ink, the sigil must be crafted 
    in one fluid motion, without leaving the page.<br>
    <br>
    The vertical line begins, breath drawn in deep. Another diagonal, no sound 
    can break her concentration it must remain on the construction of the lock. 
    The horizontal along the bottom. Sweat rises on her brow, a numbness begins 
    from the place where she has carved her flesh. Breath forced out as the last 
    lines are drawn and the etching filled with the reagent, her blood.<br>
    <br>
    To another page, to craft the protection that will allow transport. The 
    stylus falls into the pool, still growing. Care must be taken to not spill 
    the precious reagent lest the spell end. Breath is drawn as the stylus 
    drinks.<br>
    <br>
    The star must have the number of cardinal points, and the subsidiary points 
    corresponding to the paths of true magic. Twelve points drawn from her 
    blood, in concert with the timbre of her breathing.<br>
    <br>
    A circle, surrounding the star to show the unity. Devotion to her people in 
    the form of the man and the woman in the lower corner of this page.<br>
    <br>
    Turn the page and with care wet the stylus. The numbness has turned to a 
    throbbing pain, infusing the rite with dedication. The next sigil begins. A 
    shadowgate, the old way. The passage between places.<br>
    <br>
    Death closes in upon her, as she feels the life ebbing from the wound, 
    magics hold the flowing blood in place within her hand. Weak, so weak. Three 
    more etchings, must be completed. She steels her mind and continues the 
    rythym <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>of the rite. Breathing her life into 
    the strokes of each sigil.<br>
    <br>
    The bird, is next, deliverer. The page is turned, infused with the name of 
    the herald of the morning. The sigil of the sun is drawn, and then the twin 
    moons.<br>
    <br>
    Then she draws herself, helpless and trapped. Darkness surrounds her, but 
    the heavenly bodies shine upon her. <br>
    <br>
    One final word spoken, and the final breath released. The spell woven into 
    the pages. The blood and pain are thrown onto the pile of lifeless wood, and 
    her chants call to the life she has spread upon the fallen wood. <br>
    <br>
    The Book, handed as the commands are uttered silently from her mind to the 
    malleable understanding of the being she commands. Her final act, to send it 
    back to whence she was brought. To deliver her location to others, and then 
    she passes into a quiet sleep.<br>
