    <p><br>
    <font size="2" face="arial">Entry 1: Having taught myself the spoken 
	language of the humans by temporarily immersing myself in their society, I 
	decided it would behoove me to practice using their written language as 
	well. I purchased one of these blank books from a paper goods merchant and I 
	have begun to use it as what humans call a 'journal'. Upon these pages, I 
	shall attempt to transcribe my thoughts in this flawed human medium. The 
	desire to record my thoughts is a new one, perhaps the most compelling of 
	the new desires and impulses that have overcome me since the Master remade 
	me.<br>
	<br>
	Entry 2: The more I think about it, the more significant it seems to me that 
	the Master's interference has imbued me with a desire to record my thoughts. 
	It is a sense of introspection and a desire for some kind of legacy to live 
	beyond my mortal allotment. It is a strange and foreign sensation. My 
	people, or what were my people, are not given to such thoughts. I cannot 
	help but feel like it is the Master's own desires that affect me so. In 
	fact, I think, it is Master's desire for some kind of eternal legacy which 
	has committed him to this ambitious 'prodigal' project. I will think more on 
	this later.<br>
	<br>
	Entry 3: To occupy myself while I develop my mind, I have taken to 
	re-purposing some abandoned Empyrean constructs. These small 'golems' can be 
	imbued with a crude semblance of life with surprisingly little effort. It is 
	a technique very similar to the methods employed by the Virindi in their 
	creation of what the humans call 'Simulacra'. It gives me an undeniable 
	sense of pleasure to watch the small iron constructs walking and talking, 
	even though they do not have true sentience. I find it amusing, and 
	strangely comforting in my loneliness, to speak to these toy golems even 
	though they cannot comprehend me. Even a mind as superior as mine, it seems, 
	can be fooled by the illusion of companionship, when the burden of solitude 
	is too great.<br>
	<br>
	Entry 4: I have meditated on my own thoughts, and I think I have begun to be 
	able to distinguish between my own thoughts and... some other voice. I am 
	convinced I can hear the Master's voice. I have retained dim memories of the 
	nightmarish process by which the Master remade me. The voice remains the 
	same, echoing faintly in my mind. Had I not been raised a shaman, were I 
	less attuned to the voices of the spirit world, I may well mistake this 
	voice for my own. But I recognize it, and I recognize what it means. I think 
	the Master put a portion of its spirit inside of me when it remade me.<br>
	<br>
	Entry 5: I have spent time in meditation. I have managed to bridge the gap 
	between the shaman training of my youth and the new powers over void and 
	space that the fragment of the Master's essence grants me. I have traveled 
	through the realms of spirit much as I once traveled through the towns and 
	settlements of the humans. I now know that I can peer into the Master's 
	mind, even as the Master peers into mine. I have not sufficiently mastered 
	my skills to be able to speak to it, as it does to me... And perhaps I never 
	will be able to match that kind of power. I may, however, be able to cut 
	myself off from the Master's influence altogether. Somehow, I believe the 
	Master is aware of my intentions, and may even be pleased with my 
	independence.<br>
	<br>
	Entry 6: I have made so much progress it is terrifying. The Master has a 
	link to a realm of pure thought and power known as the Quiddity, one very 
	similar to the Quiddity of the Virindi that the Master has separated himself 
	from. This Quiddity is an amalgamation of the memories and powers of all the 
	beings that are linked to it. It is a shared consciousness, the perfect 
	apotheosis of all the spirit-walking, mind-sharing rituals that my former 
	people tapped into so primitively and incompletely. It took all my courage 
	to even touch upon such a powerful, perfect construct. And this Quiddity is 
	made entirely of beings created and more or less controlled by the Master's 
	own will. After gazing into the Quiddity, the Master's disparate actions 
	over the preceding years start to make a kind of awful, awe-inspiring sense.
	<br>
	<br>
	Entry 6 continued: The Master has invested itself in a dozen different 
	creatures, from Drudge to human, in an effort to preserve its own 
	consciousness for all time, to achieve a sort of immortality. The Master has 
	manipulated memories and remade minds before, most notably in the case of 
	the human Martine, when the Master was still a part of the Virindi Quiddity. 
	The Master learned from Martine what power there was in the human mind, what 
	potential can be harvested from such a chaotic and vigorous race. The Master 
	seeks some way to be able to break all that power to its own will. I now 
	believe that, through the use of its personal Quiddity, the Master intends 
	to manipulate or destroy altogether certain events in the collective minds 
	of the humans of Dereth. Such a blow to the human psyche could well pave the 
	way for the Master to truly succeed in uplifting a human with which to 
	dominate the others...<span lang="en-us">8</span></font></p>
