      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">
		<img border="0" src="mosswart1_small.jpg" width="91" height="200" align="left">Somewhere in the lowlands
      near the River Prosper sat an old man of certain age and even more certain
      dignity, hunched over next to the light of a campfire, updating and
      annotating his journal. A younger man staggered into the ring of
      firelight, carrying a pile of firewood under his left arm and a bloodied
      axe in his right hand. As quietly as he could manage, so as not to disturb
      his aged companion, he began to stoke the fire with fresh wood.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The old man finally took
      notice and looked up. “Excellent, Ardry. The augmented illumination is
      most welcome. But you left to find firewood over an hour ago! What kept
      you for such a long time?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Mosswarts, Uncle
      Aliester. A party of Mosswarts ambushed me near the river. This stretch of
      the river is thick with them.” The fire blazed with fresh fuel, lighting
      up Ardry's features. Aliester the Loquacious, great and learned sage of
      the Aluvian nation, looked up and finally noticed his nephew's torn
      clothes, singed hair, and the bloodstains on his hands and weapon.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Mosswarts you say? Would
      that I were more knowledgeable of the fauna of this island . . . I think
      our cousin Ulgrim shared some of his observations with me, however. The
      Mosswarts are the ones that ride Aurochs, correct? With purple eyes and
      pointed ears?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Uncle, you should stop
      listening to cousin Ulgrim's stories. You know how he gets after he's had
      a pint or two.” Ardry shook his head and began to wipe his hands off
      with a damp cloth. “By Pwyll, their blood is sticky . . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aliester set down his
      journal and reached for a much larger, more elaborately crafted
      leather-bound book, a massive and impressive tome that bore his name on
      the cover in gold leaf lettering. An eager gleam in his eye, he opened the
      book to a fresh, blank page, ran his fingers lightly down the richly
      textured parchment, and picked up a fresh quill.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I know you have
      adventured up and down the course of this river, Ardry. Do you know these
      Mosswarts well?” </font>
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#6B6B6B">S</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ardry sat by the fire, axe
      across his knees, and began to clean the sticky blood off the blade. He
      sighed, familiar with his uncle's probing and exhaustive questions when
      his curiosity was up. “I've had quite a few run-ins with the little
      green monsters, yes. What do you want to know?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Start from the
      beginning. How might I recognize a Mosswart if I were to encounter one?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ardry wrinkled his nose.
      “The first thing you'd notice would probably be the smell. They live in
      swamps and underground holes, for the most part, and it definitely shows.
      They smell like rot. They look like rot too, with bumpy, warty green skin.
      Ugly, bulbous yellow eyes. Crooked teeth, fetid breath that reeks like a
      sewer.” The young man shuddered in revulsion.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Distasteful beasts, I
      see.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“The worst. And their
      coloring makes it easy for them to hide among the plants and sneak up on
      you. Of course, you almost never find one by itself . . . They always
      travel in groups.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“If they travel in
      groups, are they civilized? We must catalogue all the civilized races of
      Dereth you know.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Civilized? No. I think
      they're intelligent, after a fashion. They have a language. It's total
      gibberish to me, of course, but they do seem to communicate with each
      other. Mostly through grunting and gesturing.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Grouping and language .
      . . Does this mean they have organization, some kind of social
      structure?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Well, from what I've
      seen, they do have authority figures, at least. Chieftains.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“And how do you
      distinguish a chieftain?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Well, most Mosswarts are
      about four feet tall. Chieftains are almost man-sized, with skin more of a
      foul yellow than a rotting green. They're about twice as tough and strong
      as the lesser warriors. And they occasionally cast spells.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“They know magic! I find
      that a little disheartening . . . One would like to feel singular and
      learned for having mastered the arcane arts, but if these crude little
      creatures are also able to cast spells . . .” Aliester sighed, noting
      this down in his huge book. “Well. So these chieftains -- they sound
      quite fearsome.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“They're pretty tough,
      but I'd rather fight a half dozen chiefs than one shaman, I'll tell you
      that.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Shamans? That means they
      have a religion! Tell me about their modes of worship! Have you deduced
      anything about their cosmology?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ardry shot his uncle an
      incredulous look. “Uncle, I'm a hunter and a trapper. Modes of worship?
      Cosmology?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Ah, my apologies, Ardry.
      Sometimes I become so intrigued with an idea that I forget myself. Please
      go on, tell me about these shamans . . . Why are they so much stronger
      than the chieftains?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“The chiefs cast magic
      from time to time, but seem to prefer attacking with weapons or their
      fists. The shamans rely on magic and they cast like there's no tomorrow.
      They seem to favor elemental war spells. The party that attacked me near
      the river had a shaman with them. I barely managed to duck out of the way
      when he cast a fire spell at me.” Ardry self-consciously ran his fingers
      through his charred hair, over his seared scalp.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aliester abruptly ceased
      the questioning session. He began to write furiously in his book, brows
      beetled together in concentration. Ardry was used to these sudden
      attention shifts. Without his uncle prompting him for more information,
      the younger man fell into an apprehensive silence, sitting with his back
      to the fire so that its light would not spoil his night vision.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The old man scribbled a few
      more notes in his book, then suddenly slammed it shut decisively.
      Startled, Ardry looked up.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Ardry, I want to see one
      of these shamans. Take me to these Mosswarts by the river. You didn't kill
      them all, did you?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“No, it was all I could
      do to get away. I cut down a couple as they tried to stop me, but I just
      dodged the shaman's spells as best I could, and outran the ones that tried
      to pursue me.” He absentmindedly wiped more blood off his axe blade.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“So take me to see them!
      Zarea has repeatedly admonished me for my extensive theoretical work
      without any investigation into practical matters. Ardry, I want to do . .
      . field research.” He spoke the last two words proudly and
      precipitously, as though relating a revelation. “And on the way, we can
      talk more about the creatures' background!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Uncle, I'd rather not
      have to . . .” Ardry's protest died on his lips. He could see that his
      uncle would not be dissuaded from his quest to see a Mosswart. He watched
      with no small amount of amusement as the great sage Aliester strapped a
      dagger onto his belt and gingerly placed a leather cap over his balding
      pate. The young man groaned, hefting his axe with a resigned smile.
      “Very well . . . I'll take you to their camp. But we must move silently!
      And we're not coming anywhere near them. We're just going to look at them
      for a little while.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aliester opened his mouth
      to speak, but Ardry cut him off with an imperious gesture and a stern
      glare. “We definitely will not be trying to steal any of their
      artifacts, Uncle.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The old man sighed,
      seemingly hurt, but he brushed it off, recognizing that his nephew was
      probably correct to err on the side of caution. Without further word, he
      stuffed his great book into his pack, slung the pack over his shoulder,
      and brandished his magic wand authoritatively.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Satisfied, Ardry nodded and
      started on the way. Aliester followed on his heels. “Actually, Uncle,
      the last time I delivered a letter to Gondo Kanezo for you, we had time to
      talk about some of the species of Dereth. I assume you know the Mosswarts
      are as strange to this world as we are?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I had deduced that, yes
      . . . As far as I know the only significant creatures native to Dereth are
      the Gromnies.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Kanezo says that the
      Mosswarts are related to a few other creatures, though -- Drudges,
      Banderlings, and Tumeroks. He says they come from the same world. I gather
      he's done a fair bit of creature research himself.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“The same world, eh? And
      how did he reach this conclusion?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Obviously not through
      interrogation. What he said was--” Ardry stopped and help up his hand
      for silence. His body subtly shifted to a more alert position, a lower,
      more well-balanced stance. His axe came off his shoulder, held at the
      ready. Aliester, used to trusting his nephew's wilderness instincts,
      obediently stopped short and kept still.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ardry pointed to a distant
      campfire. “We have to be very quiet . . . Their senses are very keen.
      One gets wind of us, and we'll have the whole pack at our throats.”
      Aliester nodded gravely. Satisfied that his uncle took his warning
      seriously, Ardry pressed on. Walking quickly and silently, he led the way
      down the river. Aliester tried gamely to keep up, jouncing the heavy pack
      on his back and occasionally losing a shoe in the sucking mud along the
      river's edge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Without much more
      difficulty, they closed in on the other fire. Aliester saw dark shapes
      moving around in the firelight. So fascinated was he with his first
      sighting of Mosswarts that he pressed on blindly, forgetting to keep track
      of Ardry. He didn't realize how perilously close he'd come to their camp
      until a strong hand grabbed him by the back of his robe, pulling him into
      the bushes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“You almost got
      caught!” Ardry hissed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“My apologies, Ardry.”
      Aliester was properly chastened, but his fascination with the subject of
      his investigation got the better of him. His expression grew glassy as he
      watched the Mosswarts move and grunt at each other.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Ardry? What is that one
      doing?” He pointed at one Mosswart at the edge of the fire that was, as
      far as he could tell, performing a strangely endearing little dance. Its
      lumpy head waggled with a bizarre rhythm as its limbs moved to an unheard
      beat.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I think . . . he's
      dancing. I have no idea what purpose it serves. Maybe some kind of
      communication technique? Or a ritual?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Fascinating. I can't
      take my eyes off of that odd little creature . . .” Aliester noticed
      more movement and pointed at another Mosswart, one more vividly green than
      the dull muddled color of its companions. It was shouting crude
      imprecations at the sky and gesturing wildly. “What is that one doing?
      It's shaking quite vigorously . . .”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Pwyll's bones, it's
      casting! Run!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ardry grabbed his elderly
      uncle by the back of his robe again and hauled him up. The two men
      scrambled for cover as the Shaman's lightning bolt blazed over their
      heads. A second later, they were off and racing into the night as the
      enraged cries of Mosswarts echoed after them.<br>
