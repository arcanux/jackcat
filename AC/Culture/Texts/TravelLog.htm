    We climbed down from the mountains under the cover of night and headed 
    southwest to an isolated lifestone. After lifestoning we kept moving, making 
    good time over the grassy plains. We skirted along the crystal markers that 
    define the human 'safe' towns. The creatures on the inside of the crystal 
    barrier seemed strangely subdued. Foul human magics, that steal the souls of 
    the beasts leaving them mindless, easy prey. We made our way to the River 
    Prosper and crossed at a shallow section, staying low in the water so as not 
    to be spotted by anyone crossing the bridge to the south. Continuing along 
    the barrier westward we crossed a human road, there were no signs of any 
    human travelers. They don't tend to use the roads much anymore. We followed 
    the barrier and came to a human farmhouse. We remained hidden and refreshed 
    ourselves greatly at an ancient spring. We crossed a second road staying on 
    a westward course and passed just south of a group of human houses in the 
    woods. It's now getting light and we've made camp in a small hollow deep in 
    the woods. <br>
    <br>
    Harvestgain 28th, PY14 <br>
    We awoke as dusk was falling and set out again. Continuing west we traveled 
    parallel to a road to the south of us and came to a row of houses 
    overlooking a low ridge. We found an empty house without a magical shield 
    and confiscated food and money. We moved on West again and pushed a little 
    further North to keep out of visual range of the road and another human 
    settlement. The road dipped to the southwest and we kept it within eyesight 
    until we came to a range of hills. We entered the hills and decided to move 
    southwest through a valley north of a human town then head west until we hit 
    the Inner Sea. We climbed down a ridge into the valley and came to a small 
    human encampment around a lifestone. The humans have spread so quickly 
    across this land that they think they own it all. Nearly everywhere we 
    travel there are humans claiming this land for there own. They think they're 
    so much better than us, with their mages and their 'mighty' warriors. Soon 
    there won't be anywhere left in Dereth for the rest of us! We took great joy 
    in destroying the humans' encampment and slaying those we could catch. We 
    killed them over and over again as they returned to the lifestone until they 
    escaped us by recalling to somewhere called marketplace. We lifestoned then 
    slaughtered their cattle and rabbits for meat. We traveled along the 
    valley's north wall and made camp eating our fill of their livestock. <br>
    <br>
    Harvestgain 29th, PY14 <br>
    In the early morning hours we were attacked by a band of humans. They caught 
    us off-guard and made short work of our troop. We are weakened and heading 
    back to camp now from the humans' lifestone. <br>
    <br>
    Harvestgain 29th, PY14 <br>
    We can't lose these humans - they track us relentlessly! I fear we may not 
    be able to deliver our message to General Garsh in time. I write this from 
    our camp just having returned from the lifestone this hour. Our equipment 
    wasn't stolen. I can only assume they are playing some sick game with us. We 
    are tired and we grow weary of this hellish valley. We may try and fool the 
    humans by heading north this time, perhaps we can... <br>
    <br>
    Harvestgain 29th, PY14 <br>
    We arrived back at the lifestone without weapons or armor. We have no 
    choice, but to head back to our camp to collect our things. Without them we 
    will never make it to the forward camp.<br>
