	I do not know what madness it was that possessed us to follow Grael. I could 
	see the madness and the rage burning in his eyes, his terrible red eyes. I 
	feared the bloodlust that came over him in the gladiatorial pits. My 
	brothers all worshipped him for his strength and his ferocity, and for how 
	he never seemed to let his enslavement bow his head. The pit-masters used 
	all their tricks on Grael, the same tricks they had used to break my will 
	and the will of all the other slaves. On Grael, however, it had no effect. 
	We assumed it was because he was too simple and brutal to understand. I know 
	now that is not the case.<br>
	<br>
	This savage outlander somehow managed to conceal his true nature from the 
	pit-masters. Perhaps the pit-masters were not eager to interfere with their 
	new star attraction. The northern barbarian's savage spectacles filled the 
	seats time after time, and the Queen herself became a regular attendee of 
	the combats. Grael's fights became high fashion. And it seemed a common 
	assumption that such a fierce warrior would, of course, be simple to 
	control. They never suspected how much cold cunning lurked behind those 
	burning eyes.<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps I was flattered when Grael came to me in private and asked me, in a 
	halting but understandable accent of our language, to join the rebellion he 
	planned. I know now that Grael had noticed how well my brothers fought 
	together, and how my brothers looked to me for guidance outside of the 
	bloody fighting pit. He knew that my three brothers, under my direction, 
	would serve a valued purpose in an operation that demanded coordination and 
	intelligence.<br>
	<br>
	When we won our freedom from the pit with the takeover of the arena and the 
	monstrous execution of the Queen, another fear struck me. I realized that we 
	were still just a band of slaves loose in the capital of one of the world's 
	great kingdoms; a kingdom that had destroyed my village, enslaved my 
	brothers, and had similarly eradicated Grael's own fearsome tribe of 
	warriors. We had killed our masters, but our masters' masters, I knew, would 
	come upon us with terrible wrath. I knew what the royal wizards were capable 
	of.<br>
	<br>
	So over the protests of my brothers, I decided we should separate from Grael 
	and the rest of the rebel slaves immediately after we left the arena. We 
	took advantage of the first few days of confusion in the city and fled to 
	the coast. As we escaped the city, we did see the pillars of fire streaking 
	down from the heavens to burn away the remainder of the rebels. Little did 
	we know that Grael had escaped, as well. I do not know how he did it. All I 
	know is that the rebels perished in a fiery maelstrom, and Grael lived on.<br>
	<br>
	For our own part, my brothers and I escaped to the coast. Convinced that we 
	were being chased by royal guards, we found a ship in a small fishing 
	village south of the capital and put out to sea. That may have been our 
	first mistake, because not one of us knew anything about ships or sailing. 
	We were quickly carried out to sea, beyond sight of land. I no longer know 
	how long we drifted. I know that I succumbed to heat and thirst before my 
	brothers did, and that they kept me alive through my weakness.<br>
	<br>
	We finally reached solid ground, parched of thirst and delirious from 
	exposure, on an unknown shore. Luckily, we landed near a river mouth. Fresh 
	water and game brought down by Korogaith's axe restored us to our health. We 
	took some time to explore the new land upon which we found ourselves. Shore 
	and the distant mountains seemed to have a dark and terrible energy about 
	it, visible in the sight of the learned. I attributed my misgivings, 
	however, to the lingering effects of our ordeal. I was more worried about 
	the coming winter, which could <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>quite lethal as far north as we were.<br>
	<br>
	We headed inland, to a forest we could see in the distance. We knew that the 
	woods would provide us with fire and shelter to keep us warm, and fruit and 
	game to keep us fed. If we survived the winter, we thought we could keep 
	going long enough to get our bearings and search out our old homeland, far 
	to the south. On our journey inland, Korogaith found the trail of another 
	traveler in the woods. Determined to keep all threats in front of us, I 
	decided we should track this other wayfarer and see what he, she, or it was 
	about.<br>
	<br>
	That was another mistake. Because after our third day of following this 
	trail, our quarry came upon us in the night, though we'd gone to pains to 
	conceal our presence and lit no fires. The shadow that came out of the 
	darkness to us was Grael himself, untouched by the fiery doom that had 
	befallen our erstwhile slave brethren. Grael seemed to be glad to see us, 
	and expressed enthusiastic relief and pleasure at finding us again. He told 
	us he did not think less of us for fleeing, since he did the same just two 
	days later. He congratulated us for being crafty enough to survive the city 
	and to make our way to this new land.<br>
	<br>
	Grael was very enthusiastic about the wild place in which we'd found him. He 
	named it a land of power, crisscrossed with lines of magical essence. He 
	said that a voice in the dark called him north, to a source of true power. 
	The voice promised him revenge. This time my brothers would not be swayed. 
	We joined Grael in his pilgrimage north to find the voice which spoke to 
	Grael in the darkness, even as winter advanced upon the land. I did not wish 
	to follow Grael, but neither did I wish to be left behind. I knew I would 
	not survive a winter in this untamed land on my own.<br>
	<br>
	The first snowfall came in the dark moon, just a few days after we rejoined 
	with Grael. He kept leading us implacably northward, and not even waist-deep 
	snowdrifts would slow his progress. My brothers and I were content to move 
	through the wide wake he cleared. The day after the first snowfall was 
	bitterly cold. Even wrapped in furs provided by the game Grael and my 
	brothers brought down, I was barely able to stand up straight in the 
	bone-deep chill. I fell into a stupor, automatically lifting one foot after 
	the other through frozen snow drifts as my mind retreated from the world.<br>
	<br>
	I came to under the dark moon. Neither Grael nor my brothers were visible, 
	but I could make out an eldritch glow in the woods ahead. Whether it was 
	hallucination or no, I could see terrible shapes forming, vanishing, and 
	re-forming in the weird light. I crawled forward, unable to resist the 
	desire to look upon this evil spectacle. Eventually I came upon a clearing 
	in the woods. I found Grael and my brothers there.<br>
	<br>
	Grael was suspended off the ground, arms stretched to the dark moon above. 
	His eyes were glowing as vividly as they had when he'd eaten the Queen's 
	heart. He was calling out in a guttural tongue, and tendrils of darkness 
	were forming around him, wrapping around him, extending outward from him... 
	Toward my brothers. My brothers were kneeling on the frozen ground around 
	Grael, bathed in the unholy light of the gladiator's transformation. <br>
	<br>
	Baranaith was the first victim of the living tendrils. As the darkness 
	wrapped around him, he screamed. It was a sound unlike any I had ever heard 
	him make. The terror in his wail shook me, and I closed my eyes and fell 
	face-first into the snow, paralyzed. I felt as if some great, malevolent 
	power had snatched up my brother, and was seeking me out. Then Korogaith's 
	voice joined his, and so too the voice of strong Hiranaith. My three 
	brothers were dying or being subjected to the most unholy torment, and I was 
	too frozen with terror to help them.<br>
	<br>
	When the screaming stopped, I fled. I crawled at first, and then terror lent 
	strength to my limbs. I made my way to my feet by hoisting myself up the 
	side of a gnarled and twisted tree. I ran then, as far as my legs would take 
	me. In my fear of Grael, I did not even look back to see what had become of 
	my brothers.</font><p align="right"><span lang="en-us">
