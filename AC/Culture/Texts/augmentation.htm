    <p><font face="arial" size="2">She told me to run, but I simply could not do 
	it. I watched the battle. I watched as Sir Bellas was pierced with half a 
	dozen arrows. I watched as Eleonora fell.<br>
	<br>
	It did not take them long to find me, cowering amongst the ice-covered 
	trees. I would like to say I put up more of a fight. I would like to say 
	that I tried with all my might to rescue Eleonora and Sir Bellas from King's 
	forces, but I am no soldier. This has always been true of me, and it is true 
	to this day.<br>
	<br>
	My survival is due more to dumb luck than anything else. My flight from the 
	torture chambers, my escape through the Olthoi tunnels, my harrowing trek 
	through the forests of this new world... It is all due to luck.<br>
	<br>
	When they captured me, they took me to their torture chambers. I had heard 
	the stories. I knew of what they were capable. I fully expected to end my 
	days flayed alive or pinned within the iron maiden. But no, they had another 
	fate for me.<br>
	<br>
	I did not know at the time, though it is obvious to everyone now, that 
	Varicci was experimenting with some magical method of augmenting his 
	soldiers. I do not know where he came across this ability, and I have no 
	idea how long it took him to perfect it. My capture was... how long ago? 
	Years? Months? I fear I do not quite remember. My mind has not been whole 
	for a long while. I remember fleeing the Olthoi and emerging into the 
	forests of Dereth. But I do not remember how I got there. </font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">And I don't 
	remember much of the time I spent in the towns of the Bloodless. I do 
	remember meeting the woman Jenavere. She took care of me, nursed me back to 
	health, acted as counselor along with her silent companion Hendac. They 
	listened to my stories, suffered my wailing rants. It is due to the two of 
	them that I am able to function at all.<br>
	<br>
	Though obviously not with the clarity of mind of which I was once possessed. 
	This rambling narrative ought to serve as proof of that. When I was captured 
	by Varicci's men... they executed her, didn't they? This only now has become 
	clear to me.<br>
	<br>
	Words cannot describe the grief which fills my heart. Eleonora...<br>
	<br>
	But this is not her story. Perhaps I will write of her in time. But now I 
	must relay the fate of my dear Sir Bellas.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">He was a test subject. There is no better way 
	to put it. Varicci's mages practiced their magics on him. For weeks, months, 
	they bathed him in the foul magics they had mastered on this world.<br>
	<br>
	He screamed, oh how he screamed.<br>
	<br>
	The magics twisted him. They warped his mind as well as his flesh. He was 
	already a large man to begin with, but these magics increased his size 
	fivefold.<br>
	<br>
	He was a hulking, brutish thing by the time they finished with him. Well, 
	&quot;finished&quot; may be the wrong word. They worked on him for months before he 
	exacted his terrible revenge.<br>
	<br>
	I do not know what slip the mages made. I don't know how he was freed from 
	his magical bonds, but I saw it happen. I saw as he realized that he was 
	free. And I saw the mages panic as they realized it, too.<br>
	<br>
	They tried to re-cast the binding spell, but he was too fast. They made him 
	that way.<br>
	<br>
	He killed the first mage with nothing but his hand. He simply closed it 
	around the man's head and squeezed. I had never heard a skull pop before, 
	and I dearly hope I never have to hear it again.<br>
	<br>
	He slung the dead mage's body at the others. He was upon them as they fell 
	to the ground, ripping and tearing. Limbs were pulled from sockets, heads 
	from necks. Gone was the skilled, calculating warrior I had served for so 
	many years.<br>
	<br>
	There was a wild beast, more ferocious than any Eater or Olthoi.<br>
	<br>
	I would like to say that before he fled the chamber he exchanged some small 
	look of recognition with me. But no, that did not happen. His mind was 
	shattered. He was no longer the brave and noble Sir Bellas. He was now a 
	wild thing, full of bloodlust and savagery.<br>
	<br>
	He fled the torture chamber. I heard the screams as he tore through the 
	guards above. I heard as he smashed through their cages and escaped our dank 
	prison.<br>
	<br>
	I do not know what happened to him after that. I have heard rumors that he 
	is trapped within some ancient Empyrean structure. I have also heard rumors 
	that the warriors of this world fight him for sport, pitting themselves 
	against his awesome might. I dearly hope these rumors are false. I shudder 
	to think of the pain he must endure in this state. Perhaps one day I might 
	find him. Perhaps one day I might cure him. Jenavere tells me that her Queen 
	- an Aluvian named Elysa Strathelar - might well aid me in this endeavor. I 
	hope that she will.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">In fact, that is where Jenavere has chosen to 
	take me. On the morrow, we leave this island and head to the Queen's castle. 
	I know now what to expect from her. Will she treat a coward such as me with 
	kindness and respect? Or will she subject me to the savage justice the 
	Aluvians are known for? Aluvians are but barbarians playing at nobility on 
	Ispar. Or at least, that is what we are told. I finally get to see for 
	myself whether or not this is true.<br>
	<br>
	The hour grows late. I have writte<span lang="en-us">n</span> enough. I must 
	rest, for I am still much weakened by my trials in the King's torture 
	chambers. Yes, they did experiment on me as well. But the details of those 
	experiments, they are too much to bear right now. If it were not for Enrico, 
	that dear boy...<br>
	<br>
	No, now is not the time. Perhaps I will write of them later. Or, if I am 
	lucky, they will simply fade from memory.<br>
	<br>
	Yes, that would be nice.<br>
