    <font face="Arial" size="2">Summer had melted into autumn, leaving the days shorter. The 
    boy didn't care, he just wanted to chase the butterflies. Six years old and 
    full of life. Seven years had passed since the Olthoi queen was killed, 
    since Elysa had lost Thorsten, since Borelean had lost his unknown father.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They had come outside after dinner to sit, as they often 
    did, and watch the sun fall over the distant coast of Dereth. Borelean loved 
    the colors, especially the purples. There was no care, no worry, no strife, 
    no question, just he, his mother and his Uncle Ash. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa watched her son framed by the orange haze of the 
    parting day, just out of reach; the first tear fell. Seven years was not 
    that long after all, and this time of year always came too quickly and too 
    quietly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You're thinking of him again,” Asheron paused, placing a 
    neatly folded kerchief on the table beside her. She left it there untouched 
    and choked the tears back, regaining her composure quickly. “You needn't 
    hide it, Elly.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'm not hiding it. . .” she protested, her voice already 
    calm, controlled and devoid of the boiling grief within her. “It's hard to 
    look at him, and see Thorsten's eyes.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A moment passed. Borelean giggled as a butterfly turned 
    the chase back upon him, landing on his shoulder. Gently, he placed his 
    finger beneath the insect and hoisted it to look at it in the light of the 
    sun. Asheron shook beside her as he watched Borelean. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“When I knew. . . that I was carrying him, I should have 
    told Thorsten. He should have known that he would have this child. . . 
    but--” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“He wouldn't have let you go into the hive. . .” Asheron 
    finished. She nodded. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“For all he said, and all he loved, and all that we had 
    been through, he never would have let me in there. . . and then. . .” she 
    trailed off. Asheron took up his glass and sipped the wine she'd made. She 
    watched his mouth pucker. He had never acquired a taste for bitter spirits. 
    She shook her head. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I have done much in my life that I regret, Elly, but none 
    so much as the pain that I have caused you. I have taken your life, your 
    love, and left your son without a father. But my greatest regret is that 
    there will come a time when you need me most, and I will be powerless to aid 
    you. . .” He placed his arm upon her shoulder and turned her to face him. 
    “They are filled with love and nothing more.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Borelean laughed and scampered toward them wearing a smile 
    as wide as his face. Elysa turned from Asheron and stood to meet her child. 
    She smiled, opening her arms wide, hugging him as she lifted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I love you, Mommy.” He pecked her cheek and looked into 
    her eyes. She smiled.</font></td>
