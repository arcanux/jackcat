    Antius made his way along the road leading into Hebian-to. No one in 
    Cragstone knew of Rage Lao’s whereabouts. He hoped beyond hope that his 
    search would be more fruitful in the Sho capital. The sun was high in the 
    sky and the city was active, hope filled him when he saw that the archmage’s 
    shop door was open and two patrons stood within. One ran off before he had 
    the time to speak but the second remained behind.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">
    <img border="0" src="../Dereth/Across/119.jpg" align="left" width="169" height="200"></font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Excuse me, miss?” He spoke softly as to not startle her.</font></p>
    
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes?” She asked as she turned to him.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Do you happen to know a man who goes by the name, Rage 
    Lao?” Antius asked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Yes,” she replied smiling brightly, “used to be in the 
    same monarchy as him.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was more than simply hope now, it was nearly assured 
    that Antius would find the man and garner the information that the council 
    needed to continue its investigations. Ever since the wave of magic first 
    coursed over Dereth there were questions. What caused the surge? What had 
    the surge of magic hit? What happened and what caused this? He felt closer 
    to those answers. The process to find Rage Lao had been exhaustive, but town 
    criers, merchants and others were forthcoming with the information once they 
    understood the severity of the situation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Excellent, might you know where I can find him?” he 
    asked, “It is a matter of some importance to the High Queen.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Only place would be at the mansion not far outside of 
    Arwic.” The woman paused, “If he’s even awake.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Antius frowned. Not as fruitful as he would have liked, 
    still enough information to work with. In his excitement he realized that he 
    had forgotten his manners and quickly tried to recover.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“How foolish of me, I am Seneschal Antius Blackmoor.” He 
    paused, “Outside of Arwic you say…” again he frowned, “Perhaps you know some 
    of the people he entered the temple in the Blackmire Swamp with?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Tiffney, and I am sorry, I have no idea,” the woman 
    replied pleasantly.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Very well, thank you for your time.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No problem, sorry that I wasn’t more of a help to you.” 
    She smiled and left the shop.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <img border="0" src="../Dereth/Across/116.jpg" align="right" width="152" height="200"></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Another patron had overheard the discussion and now bowed 
    before Antius. He was taken aback. <i>Now I know how Elysa feels when I do 
    this, </i>Antius thought.</font><i><font size="2">. </font></i></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I couldn’t help but overhear, sir. I believe that Lao is 
    slumbering, but if you give me a moment I could see about waking him,” the 
    patron said, offering a kind gesture. “I can contact my allegiance mates and 
    see if they can find someone who might know him.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“If you cannot find him, then perhaps anyone that he 
    traveled with into the depths of the temple within the Blackmire Swamp. I <i>
    must</i> speak with those that first entered that temple,” Antius replied. 
    He also noticed the armor that the man wore – it was unusual.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You have nice armor,” the man said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I was thinking the same of the breastplate you wear. Not 
    crafted by the hands of any Isparian, that is clear. The design is also too 
    rigid and coarse to have been crafted during the Yalain epochs. It must be 
    older...” Antius continued to inspect the armor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“The armor I wear now is from the Blackmire Swamp, we call 
    it the Blackmire Armor.” The man responded with a bright smile, obviously 
    proud of his prize. Antius felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. 
    “I am Mage Master, the humble follower of Princess Ashake.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I have heard of Ashake, as has High Queen Elysa... have 
    you had any luck finding any of the first few to enter that Temple?” Antius 
    responded absently, then pressed forward half-thinking aloud moving a hand 
    to scratch at his chin, “Dericostian armor also seems rounder in appearance. 
    This armor is unique. I must apologize for forgetting myself. I am Seneschal 
    Antius Blackmoor,” he finished, finally taking his eyes off of the armor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No sir, I have not. Perhaps you should try Arwic,” the 
    man suggested.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Thank you,” Antius said and turned to head back into the 
    day and find his way to Arwic.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As usual, Arwic was bustling. He made his way into the 
    local tavern and sat waiting, hoping that word would reach Rage Lao and that 
    his search would not be in vain. At last a man cloaked in a Gelidite Robe 
    found in the frozen and forgotten city of Frore made his way into the 
    establishment and came to his table.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hello,” the man said timidly. Antius stood and saluted 
    the man who returned the salute with a look of confusion.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">
    <img border="0" src="../Dereth/Across/117.jpg" width="412" height="300"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Hail.” The two men sat and exchanged smiles. “I've been 
    asked to look into the events that took place in the Blackmire Swamp not 
    long ago. High Queen Elysa Strathelar has asked that I speak with you 
    directly as you are the one person that we could confirm was present when 
    the wave of magic washed across Dereth.”</p>
    <p><font size="2">“Okay,” Rage Lao, still nervous, responded.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“What happened, exactly? We've been receiving reports that 
    there is something within that temple...some creature that we have not seen 
    before.” A pause. “I was hoping you could tell me. The Royal Guard and I 
    surveyed the area but found nothing of interest the night after the Mosswart 
    ran into Sawato.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Rage Lao leaned back in his seat as other patrons made 
    their way into the tavern. “Well, we found a temple, cave or grotto of 
    Empyrean make. Looking around, I discovered a secret wall, behind which was 
    a dead looking vine that I reached for and tried to pick up. But,” he shook 
    his head as if remembering the pain of the moment, “it teleported me, but it 
    was unlike anything I have felt before, like my body was being torn apart…”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Please, continue.” Antius said as he leaned forward, 
    listening.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Inside was a strange temple. On each wall was a button 
    revealing secret doors, challenges and tests that we passed easily. Sclavus 
    were within, working with Falatacot Patriarchs and Matriarchs.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“More Falatacot?” Antius interjected.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“They seemed to be guarding the place with the Sclavus.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Sclavus and the Falatacot make sense, in my travels I 
    have learned that they enact the Rites once performed by the Falatacot blood 
    cults.” Antius said thoughtfully.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Interesting…”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“It does not surprise me that they would be working in 
    unison.” There was a long pause as patrons ordered ale and milled about. 
    “Lao, I apologize if I am being rather informal, but I would like to know 
    whether you can contact any of the others who were with you in that temple. 
    Elysa-- The High Queen, and the council believe that...well...”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“I am listening.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“After speaking with Shoyanen and Celdiseth, we believe 
    that you may have triggered new portals.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“You mean those creatures, I had never seen one of them on 
    this island of Dereth before.“</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes. We don't mean to alarm you, or anyone in the 
    populace...but with Lord Asheron out of contact deep within the halls of his 
    ancestral home...we are at a loss.” Antius paused a moment searching the 
    man’s face. Realization was setting in. “The magic that washed over Dereth...do 
    you recall of what I am speaking?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“I remember, when my party entered, there was some spell 
    that bound us together, but—“</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“I was speaking of the magic that washed across this world 
    and struck some sort of barrier. Do you remember that?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes…yes…it was alarming to say the least. I did not think 
    much of it then, but now, I am becoming worried a bit,” Rage Lao stammered. 
    Antius hated this. It was unfair and was beginning to attract attention. He 
    looked to the other patrons then and asked the question of those gathered.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Anyone recall the magic I am speaking of?” Numerous nods 
    and muted voices filled the tavern. &quot;That magic as unlike anything that we 
    have ever seen before. Our best guess is that it was some type of spell 
    meant to seal something. If Celdiseth is right then it struck some other 
    spell that was meant as a barrier.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“A barrier from who?” a woman in the crowd asked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Fadsahil and Ciandra are currently working with others 
    within the Arcanum to determine that as we speak. As best as we can surmise 
    it may be a protective barrier that had been put in place by Lord Asheron. 
    Something meant to keep the Olthoi out... but that is not clear at this 
    time.” Antius spoke knowing full well that it was the best guess anyone 
    could muster at this time. The fact was they didn’t know if what they had 
    seen and felt was even real. “It may have all been part of the same 
    illusion... if it was an illusion.” More muted discussion began, people 
    wondering if a barrier could really keep the Olthoi out. “But the reason I 
    am here is to find out if there were any objects within that temple that 
    could have been identified as portals.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“You mean the strange devices?” a voice called from the 
    crowd.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes, the devices…” Rage Lao said and Antius felt his 
    heart sink deeper.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Truly?” It was all he could say. He knew that he would 
    find that they were there, but he had been hoping that it might all be an 
    illusion. <i>It’s not, </i>Antius<i> </i>thought</font><i><font size="2">, 
    something has found its way here and the Isparians are to blame for this. 
    Our ignorance has brought something to the world that even the Falatacot 
    feared.</font></i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes, in fact one of my friends brought one back to their 
    mansion,” Rage Lao continued.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Can you take me to it?” Antius asked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The run was not long, the mansion sat at a landing carved 
    into a steep hill. Several people milled about, curious as to his arrival. 
    They spoke quietly amongst themselves leaving Antius and the others that had 
    gathered to continue discussing.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2">
    <img border="0" src="../Dereth/Across/118.jpg" width="420" height="300"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“This is the device?”&nbsp; Antius asked, knowing full well it 
    had to be. Two concentric circles surrounded a solid disk with a red center, 
    like an ever-watchful eye staring across worlds. It was hooked at the corner 
    of the mansion. The circles floated, defying the world to pull them to the 
    ground -- powerful geomantic magic. Shoyanen would be interested in seeing 
    these.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes it is. Could we be vulnerable to attacks now?” Rage 
    Lao asked, his discomfort becoming more apparent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“It is unclear,” Antius stated as he looked the device 
    over, consulted notes that he had been given by Shoyanen and looked at the 
    dimensions and artistic impression of the device. “Were there any others 
    like this?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Few that I have seen.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“I meant in the temple, Lao.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes.” The woman, who had identified herself after 
    speaking in the bar as Askani, spoke up. “Four of them.” Others began 
    confirming her statement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Yes, there were four others, five if you count this one.” 
    Rage Lao paused and lowered his head. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“The others, did they do anything?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“They drained my health when I touched them.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“As if siphoning your life?”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“All four of them did.” Rage stumbled for more words. 
    “Only at first, I couldn't get them to produce the siphoning again.” Antius 
    lowered his head and the crowd could sense the weight of the situation. 
    “When we entered the room, I was the only one brave enough to touch them.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Or crazy,” a voice called from the crowd. Voices began to 
    rise and Antius turned away.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“These creatures...that were in this temple...were they 
    there before or after you used those devices?” Antius asked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Now that you mention it, they were there after…” Rage Lao 
    walked to Antius’ side and spoke quietly. “I used those devices, and they 
    started entering the room.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“A spell to seal them away...” Antius said to no one in 
    particular.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“So they are using them now freely to enter our world?” a 
    voice in the crowd demanded. <i>Our world? This isn’t our world, and the 
    longer we’re here the more we make a mess of it, </i>Antius thought. The 
    crowd began to become belligerent and angry toward Rage Lao.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“I hope I did not bring something terrible into this 
    world,” Rage Lao said quietly, “but it does look that way.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“It is possible that these creatures are coming from 
    somewhere else.” Antius shook his head and placed a hand on Rage Lao’s 
    shoulder. “Don't blame yourself. There is no way that you could have known, 
    Lao. We are still fledglings here.” </font><i><font size="2">How true, this 
    is just another example of this. Asheron’s not here to fix this problem. We 
    need to find an answer on our own.</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Thank you, I feel a bit better, but still a little 
    uneasy,” Rage replied. <i>You and I both, Lao…you and I both, </i>Antius 
    thought</font><i><font size="2">.</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Should a group accompany members of the council to 
    further investigate?” another patron who had made himself known asked from 
    the gathered crowd.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“That may well occur... I am sorry, I did not catch your 
    name.”</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Dirk, sire.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Another addressing him as a noble, it made him 
    uncomfortable. He had come here to learn and was leaving with more questions 
    than answers. He was also making matters worse by involving so many. But 
    there was little that could be done about that now.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Please, I am not nobility. You needn't address me as 
    sire.” He walked to the edge of the mansion, careful not to breach the 
    barrier. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“Antius, we could take you there for a look at the 
    creatures yourself, if you wish,” another crowd member offered.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">“No, no. I must report these findings to the council.” He 
    looked to all assembled and removed the gem that would return him to Elysa’s 
    stronghold from his pouch. “Thank you for your time.” As he crushed the gem, 
    he could help but think that time was going to become short for all of them.
    </font></p>
    <p><i><font size="2">Something has crossed the vast divide to this world, 
    something that an ancient race feared. What have we done?</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="2">Elysa was waiting with Shoyanen, Fadsahil and Ciandra.</font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
