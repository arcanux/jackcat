    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/crystalquest.asp">
    Zone</a></font></span><p><b><font face="arial" size="2">October 4, 2000</font></b><font size="2">
    </font><p><font face="arial" size="2">“Life has strange rhythms, especially in our new 
    world. I recently took up a new hobby to fill my leisure time between 
    experiments in alchemy and metallurgy. I began dabbling in the field of 
    geomancy: the study of the land's magical energies. Little did I know that 
    my amateur interest would become so central to my research so quickly!”&nbsp;
    </font>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">So begins the latest text by Zarea bint Zia, “<i>The 
    Breaking of the Crystal Core</i>.” The time for geomancy has never been more 
    appropriate, as scholars have proven that the menhir rings indeed act as 
    portals to the recently discovered Vestibule dungeons. And it is only 
    natural, these scholars say, that the mystic forces of Dereth have chosen to 
    appear in the form of crystals, long regarded as magical conduits. While the 
    Fenmalain, Caulnalain, and Shendolain Vestibules truly glimmer, with strange 
    growths of crystals and wisps of phosphorescent gas, their seeming beauty 
    belies the utmost danger. Explorers entering the Vestibules unprepared will 
    find themselves swiftly returned to their respective lifestones. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The adventurers of Dereth should be advised that all three 
    recently launched Vestibule quests are still very much active. But beware! 
    In order to fully access the dungeons, players must be fortunate enough to 
    find those keys dropped upon the death of certain creatures. For the 
    Fenmalain Vestibule, limited to levels 10-25, these keys can be recovered 
    from both Shadows and Shadow Children. For the Caulnalain Vestibule, limited 
    to levels 26-35, Shadow Lieutenants hold the keys. And for players level 36 
    and higher, keys to the formidable Shendolain Vestibule can only be found 
    among the Grievvers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">In order to reach the dungeons, players must then find the 
    appropriate menhir ring portals, located in the southern and northern 
    mountain ranges, for the Fenmalain and Caulnalain Vestibules respectively, 
    as well as on the Obsidian Plain, for the Shendolain Vestibule. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Although separated by level, no one quest should be taken 
    lightly. Soloing is not advised and a coordinated effort by a well-balanced 
    group highly recommended. Once in the Vestibule dungeons, adventuring 
    parties should be prepared to face not only the Soul Crystals themselves, 
    but also deadly arrays of Shadow guards and their undead henchmen. To 
    continue beyond the latter half of the dungeons, players will require their 
    keys -- which means that all adventurers who die beyond this point will 
    require yet another key to return and recover their bodies. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">While certain heroes did manage to shatter the original 
    Soul Crystals within each dungeon, duplicates have reformed in their places. 
    The destruction of these weaker, re-grown crystals does not generate news of 
    the same world-spanning import as that of the Soul Crystals . . . yet 
    valuable shards may still be recovered from their wreckage -- rich gems 
    highly sought after by the craftsmen of Uziz. Already, successful 
    adventurers have reported trading the gems for items both rare and wondrous. 
    Shields, uniquely crafted arrows, even spellcasting orbs seem capable of 
    being created, with these powerful crystal shards at hand. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">Of course, even without the Vestibule keys, players may 
    wish to test their mettle and explore the upper reaches of these dungeons. 
    Truly, they are not a sight to be missed. Although, it must also be said: <i>
    To proceed hastily is but to invite quick death!</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">(<b>Update</b>) Following the recent launch of November's 
    event, “<i>Should the Stars Fall</i>,” certain aspects of the Vestibules 
    have been made a little friendlier. The keys to the Fenmalain, Caulnalain, 
    and Shendolain Vestibules can now be given away. Also, the final reward 
    items not only weigh less, but are now less likely to be lost upon death.
