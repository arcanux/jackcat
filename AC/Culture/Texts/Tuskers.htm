    <font face="Arial" size="2">Test Subject: Alpha male tusker. <br>
    <br>
    Goal: Achievements with the &quot;feral tribe&quot; have inspired the study to be 
    undertaken. Intentions are to locate and identify or otherwise modify to 
    include the mana energy receptor in &quot;bestials&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Success: Introduction of unwavering loyal &quot;bestial entity&quot; to the Quiddity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Procedure: Prior studies have alerted the collective to the resonance of all 
    energy related function from grey material beneath the crown of the the 
    &quot;bestial&quot; epidermis. <br>
    <br>
    Stimuli will be introduced to the grey matter through contact of a physical 
    nature, visual stimuli, and audial stimuli. Should these methods fail, 
    introduction of grey matter will continue until goals are achieved or the 
    subject destroys itself. <br>
    <br>
    Prior Modification: Physical enhancement has been introduced to enhance 
    strength, speed and lessen pain to epidermis of the subject. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker. <br>
    <br>
    Test #1: Introduction of stimuli directly to the fleshy grey matter that 
    drives flesh energy sources. <br>
    <br>
    Result: Howling. Rage. No coherent energy processes. Unlike tests with 
    physically enhanced &quot;guards&quot; the tampering with grey matter has turned the 
    beast against its master. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Further study needed, base understanding of fear and pain 
    corresponds to loss of ardor toward masters. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker. <br>
    <br>
    Test #2: Introduction of stimuli. Destruction of mate (Subject #2) in visual 
    range. <br>
    <br>
    Result: No visible change in subject as subject #2 brought before subject. 
    As epidermis of subject #2 is flayed Howls. Rage. Coherent energy processes 
    include desire to destroy master. Failure. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Stimulus fails to elicit expected response. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test #3: Stimuli food source denial. <br>
    <br>
    Result: After five moon risings the subject became docile and responded to 
    visual assertions. Food source is abundant on shrouded Isle located to the 
    south of the home of the &quot;Light Child&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Receptive once emaciated and nearly dead. This device will be 
    used should the subject forget who the master is. <br>
    <br>
    Test subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test #4: Stimuli removal of visual receptors. <br>
    <br>
    Result: Slicing the connection to visual receptors resulted in: Howling, 
    Panic and Rage. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Reattachment of visual receptors required for further study. 
    Subject becomes destructive when removed from visual stimuli for long 
    periods. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Administer: Entity &quot;Martine&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Test #5: Stimuli: Destruction of apparent herd mate; male by way of 
    epidermal implosion. <br>
    <br>
    Result: Directed anger. Focused rage. Fear as attentions were turned to 
    subject. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: As previously discovered subject has sense of mortality. 
    Further, is capable of distinguishing between unalike entities. <br>
    <br>
    Test subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test #6: Stimuli: Removal of audial receptor. <br>
    <br>
    Result: No noticeable change. Reaction only to visual stimuli. Sc!@#$%^&amp;* of 
    metal on stone no longer effective in arousing fear within subject. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Poor test. Failed to accomplish any finding other than to 
    determine that lack of audial receptor increases likelihood of bestial 
    entity to disobey its masters. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test #7: Addition of like harvested grey materials. <br>
    <br>
    Result: Epidermal cavity can no longer contain grey material. Results are 
    inconclusive as material appears to have not yet healed. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Further moon risings needed to tabulate effectiveness. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test Results #7: 8 moon risings have transpired since the addition of grey 
    materials to the subject. No considerable change has been made aside from a 
    heightened recognition in the ocular organs. The subject responds more 
    readily to my presence. However there is little more in way of the 
    manipulation of mana energies. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Add more grey material to the overfull cranial cavity. Allow 
    eight moon risings for healing. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Results #7a: Again there has been no marked increase with the discovery of a 
    mana energy receptor. However the subject mumbled incoherently. Puppet 
    suggested teaching the subject a language. As the language we use is 
    incoherent and the subject seems to have intonations more closely akin to 
    &quot;outlanders&quot; than &quot;ferals&quot; we shall begin to teach the subject the common 
    &quot;outlander&quot; language. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: We draw closer to discovery. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test Results #7b: Additional grey material has responded poorly to exposure 
    to atmosphere. Shell built to contain and protect the material. This has 
    reduced rejection of material. Concepts aside from speech have appeared in 
    subject. Yet the goal of the experiment has yet to be achieved. Subject 
    refers to itself as &quot;Oolutanga&quot;, often. Subject refers to master as &quot;God&quot;. I 
    like this. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: Levistras may bring the Quiddity's wrath upon us too soon. I 
    have <br>
    <br>
    invited the &quot;outlanders&quot; to my laboratory to let them bear witness to my 
    creation. Yet I wonder now if there will be time. <br>
    <br>
    Subject has grown more intelligent and capable but still lacks the ability 
    to formulate the necessary concentration of mana energies. I will chance one 
    more application of grey material before I destroy the subject. <br>
    <br>
    Test Subject: Alpha male tusker <br>
    <br>
    Test Result #7c: Another application has healed. For 4 cycles of this worlds 
    moons I have labored to draw forth a mana energy manipulating &quot;bestial&quot; to 
    no avail. Now at the peak of my research I must abandon the subject for a 
    time while I attend to the ministrations of the Quiddity. <br>
    <br>
    My subject will be sequestered within my laboratory until my return. If I 
    return. Though my encounter with the &quot;energy source&quot; has given me new hope 
    that I may deceive the Singularity I cannot be assured <br>
    <br>
    until I have faced them and returned without cleansing. <br>
    <br>
    Deceipt of lesser forms is more simple for trappings of their kind are all 
    that is necessary for integration and acceptance. But the Quiddity 
    scrutinizes with much more diligence. <br>
    <br>
    Puppet shall remain here as a guardian. <br>
    <br>
    Conclusion: <br>
    <br>
    Upon return from portal flux, found research laboratory in ruin. Puppet's 
    rags littered material floor. Subject left energy signature condu<span lang="en-us">c</span>ive 
    to mana manipulation on Puppets tatters. <br>
    <br>
    Experiment success. <br>
    <br>
    Location of subject &quot;Oolutanga&quot; unknown. Censure from the Singularity's 
    finding will restrict my capacity to search for the subject. Concentration 
    must be maintained</font><br>
