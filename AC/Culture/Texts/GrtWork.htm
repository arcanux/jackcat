    the Scribe in Zaikhal - 13.8N, 0.1E</font></span><p><font face="Arial"><small><em>Much of
    this text was charred by the heat of the crystal device found in the Lost City of Frore.
    Here follows the extent that can be reconstructed - Kuyiza bint Zayi</em> </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...has been three months since excavations began. Acolyte
    Frisirth has been of great aid, using his powers to shape the tunnels without need of
    spade or shovel. This magic was unknown to us, but it seems Frisirth's family had
    preserved some of the most eldritch of the Falatacot magics. He himself believes that it
    is one of the spells used by the gods the witches worshipped in the swamps, from the time
    before men crawled across the land. I do not know what use these land-shaping spells may
    have been to them, but... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...amazing discovery! Frisirth had gone on of his own accord,
    casting tunnels above the main level of Frore. He claims he felt called onwards. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The crystal is enormous, a pale sliver spinning slowly in
    place. It emits a light which seems most peculiar to my eye; as if every object within its
    radiance cast a second shadow, violet and flickering in and out of vision. But my eyes are
    not quite what they were, after all; I could be mistaken. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Or perhaps this is merely an expected effect, due to the
    power contained within it. If only we could safely consult one of the Old Lords. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I cannot guess the antiquity nor purpose of this
    construction, but its method of discovery seems to be an act of destiny. I do wonder if it
    may be an agent of prophesy... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...definitely has some intrinsic magical connection with the
    deep earth. We cannot discern what it may be, but Frisirth assures us that it is harmless.
    I am concerned about the lad - he has spent more and more of his time poring over the more
    obscure of the surviving Falatacot texts - the Uotecatl Ceqt of Nahouhnztl, and the
    fragments of the Book of Eibhil. In the past year, the Council has barely seen him, as he
    continues his experiments on the crystal. When last we spoke he was agitated and
    distracted, but assured us that he was drawing close to finding a use for the crystal
    which would answer the prophesy of the Fourth Sending. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...crystal's magical bond to the depths of the world will
    allow us to draw the heat out of it, as volcanoes do. By this drawing and containing of
    the heat-energy within the earth, we will bring about the Great Frost we have sought for
    so long. Fennagar expressed the opinion that drawing such heat into our city of ice might
    be fatal, but Frisirth seemed quite convinced that the crystal can contain it safely. It
    is hard to check the lad - he seems overjoyed that his work might be used to bring the
    prophesy to fruition, and allow us to return home. <font color="#6B6B6B">EpiK
    SUCKS</font></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Home! The majestic Plateau of Gelid, where the Kings of
    Dericost once reigned in icy splendor! After the years of persecution by the barbarian
    Yalain, and the subsequent period spent hiding from the plague Alaidain's blood loosed
    upon the land... No, I dare not think on it further, lest my anticipation prove
    ill-founded. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Fenngar came to my room later today, after the meeting. He
    said that Frisirth has had an unhealthy glow in his eyes of late. I laughed at the choice
    of words, and he amended to an unwholesome glow. I suggested that the boy has merely been
    absorbed overmuch in his studies of the crystal. Now that they have reached fruition,
    surely he will rejoin... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...first week of casting has gone well, I think. The
    crystal's bond to the depths is definitely stronger than it was before. Whereas prior to
    our work it was of indifferent temperature, it definitely radiates heat. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I feel I should mention, however, a most peculiar experience
    while casting on the Great Work last morn. The Council and the Lords had ringed the
    crystal, and had begun to weave together the strands that would allow us to collectively
    bend the force within it to our needs. While the chanting commenced, I chanced to brush
    the terminus of the crystal's aural presence with my awareness. In that moment, it was as
    if the light of the room had been swept away. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>It was not unlike the experience of passing out, before I
    took my last mortal breath. The steady drone of the chant collapsed into a dull, distant
    buzz. Light and color faded and spun away, while the pale facets of the gem remained fixed
    in the center of my view. At that moment, I would swear I saw, within the depths of the
    crystal, a pair of smoldering red eyes swing to meet mine. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>In a halfbreath, the two eyes shattered into twelve, and then
    I found myself staring as the Great Work as before; the Lords chanting around me, the room
    brightly lit, and the translucent crystal rotating with a reassuring serenity. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I did not mention this peculiar experience to my colleagues;
    doubtless it was some unexpected side effect of our spells upon the artifact. I might have
    achieved some glimpse of the future, such as the Falatacot would receive during their
    unsavory scarification rituals. An intriguing experience overall. Once the Great Work is
    complete, I look forward to investigating it in more detail. It may be of some use in the
    coming era. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...luminosity of the Great Work has increased tenfold. The
    crystal now suffuses the entire chamber with a lambent yellow glow, and the heat coursing
    from it has made the casting sessions uncomfortable for all but Frisith. The lad has
    become a mighty enchanter indeed. He seems to be the only one of us who rests easy during
    meditation; it seems I am far from alone in my experience of dark visions during... </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>...Frisander brought the most ancient of our texts, claiming
    it had been in Frisirth's care for the last several hundred years. I did not ask how he
    had procured them, for the answer was obvious - I must remember to chastise him at some
    later date, privately. It is not proper that a member of the Council should resort to
    thieving from one of the Lords. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I read the sections that were the focus of his concern -
    obscure and irresponsible references to the forbidden Falatacot gods that were worshipped
    by the Old Lords. The writing was incomplete, having decayed with the passing of aeons,
    but seemed to imply titanic battles between the witch-gods and a force which writhed
    within the bowels of the earth. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>After a half-hour of browsing the fragmentary texts, I asked
    Frisander to simply explain his concerns. I have no taste for the cryptic references of
    the Book of Eibhil - the shocking descriptions of the most debased Falatacot blood
    rituals, the inscrutable whispers about the &quot;Mouth of the Abyss&quot;, the &quot;Web
    of the Elder Gods&quot;, the &quot;Pulse of Darkness&quot; which sucks at the lighted
    world above, and other archaic blasphemies. I confess, the book was unnerving me to some
    degree. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>He felt that our use of the Great Work - the magical crystal
    found by Frisirth - might have been premature. We still do not know whence it came, nor
    what its original purpose was. All we know is that the power within it has some mysterious
    tie to the nether regions of the earth, which we exploit to capture the heat from the
    world. What if, he asked, in addition to drawing up heat, we were also drawing up this
    force alluded to in the Falatacot texts? </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Preposterous, and I told him so. That we should rely upon the
    oldest and most debased of the Falatacot myths, instead of our modern understanding of
    magic, is ridiculous. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We are already having an effect upon the world; scouts sent
    beyond the outer caverns report that temperatures have dropped, and snow is becoming more
    prevalent. On the back of the hand, a party of the outlander people managed to find the
    entrance to the outer caves last week. Frisirth moved quickly, rallying the Initiates and
    Acolytes in defense. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>They are far more primitive than even the Yalain, barely
    possessing any magical ability at all. Still, we of the Council had to take action at the
    very Gates of the City before Frisirth could slay and enslave their souls to us. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>We are on the cusp of going home, or being discovered by the
    cattle that call Killiakta their home now. This is a critical time - to call a halt to the
    Great Work would be folly of the gravest sort. </small></font></td>
