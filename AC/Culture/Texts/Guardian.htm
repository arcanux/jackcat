    <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Allan Maki, Turbine Entertainment Software</b>
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sunlight filtered into the clay hovel through 
    fresh cracks. A heady scent of boiling meat filled the room and caused his 
    nose to twitch as he struggled free from another fitful night of rest.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">His nightmares were getting worse. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A guttural cough alerted him that there were 
    others stirring in the new day Sun. Soon they would be mulling about, 
    picking dvorahd bugs from the fur on their feet and whining about the long 
    walk that faced them. Dnaraag pushed out a heavy sigh as he opened his eyes 
    and rubbed away his nightmare visions. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He peered through one of the cracks and spied 
    a guard rousing others from their slumber with a sharp stick. He pulled his 
    knees tight against his chest, peeled the Ursuin pelt from his body and 
    tossed it into a corner. His mate let out an affectionate trill. Gulnaach 
    looked toward him as she stirred the morning gruel over a small fire. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He responded in kind as he felt something 
    sting his heel. A dvorahd burrowed deeper beneath his fur, nestling there, 
    then biting his foot. He scratched it with dirt-blackened claws and moaned. 
    The day had just begun and already he had regretted greeting the Sun. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gulnaach drew a ladle of gruel and poured it 
    into a chipped bowl; sandstone grated on old metal as the ladle scraped the 
    bowl. Dnaraag looked at her gnarled fingers, swollen by the sudden 
    relocation to a colder clime, another reminder of failure. How much longer 
    would his tribe tolerate this incompetence? </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whiskers twitched as he smiled at his mate 
    and crawled toward the table where she placed the gruel. His stomach 
    rumbled. Stale bread, stolen in a raid as they searched for a more permanent 
    home, lay on the table collecting flies. Dnaraag reached for the loaf and 
    tore a piece free. He swatted a fly away and scraped off a corner that had 
    grown green with mold. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Wind whistled through the flaps of Mite skin 
    hanging over the entryway. Outside, the remainder of the tribe grew anxious. 
    Weapons clattered against one another in shows of strength, howling voices 
    rose to welcome the Sun. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bread drank the red broth like a hungry 
    cub. Dnaraag popped it in his mouth and hooked his claws onto a heavy piece 
    of meat. Greyed by the boiling, the Reedshark meat retained its salty 
    flavor. It was harder to eat than Mite flesh, but was sustenance all the 
    same. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They had traveled for a quarter cycle of the 
    moons. In that time they had been forced to build ramshackle shelters from 
    mud and sticks. These makeshift dwellings crumbled within days of being 
    built. This world was far different from theirs. There were no caves for 
    them to inhabit, though sometimes a portal would open to a structure that 
    could be taken from beings of lesser strength. Often they would find 
    creatures that were stronger than they, resistant to their shaman magic and 
    resilient enough to withstand onslaught from their guardians and scouts.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dnaraag grunted and pushed the bowl away, 
    sated. Outside the clamor had turned into the sound of a hundred members of 
    his tribe eating morning gruel. Slurps, chomps and the occasional row filled 
    the chill morning air and allowed him time to think and talk with his mate. 
    They spoke in hushed tones, for they discussed a matter most foul. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Mangluuad is a good Chieftain.” He stared at 
    the mite skin flaps, unable to meet her eyes. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“He is feeble,” she retorted. He let out a 
    simple grunt. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Can he be blamed for this?” he asked, 
    turning his attention to a buzzing fly that landed on a scrap of bread.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“He must,” she said, scraping the bottom of 
    her cooking pot, dented and blackened by time and use. She licked her claws 
    clean and continued. “He has not listened to the scouts who say there is a 
    fortress of Mites here in the mountains. Instead he dreams of taking a 
    settlement from the humans, a settlement that may not exist.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He sighed. “He is the wisest among us.” His 
    resolve fluttered, as it had every day since she had first made these 
    accusations. It was true: Magluuad had given no thought to any course beyond 
    his dream of winning a human settlement. His tribe had lived in the hills in 
    the south before the sundering, when the purple winds swirled and took them 
    away. They had ruins there, and prime fields for hunting Aurochs and Mites. 
    Then the sundering came and they were thrust here. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gulnaach clacked her teeth together sharply. 
    “He is weak, his mind addled.” Her words, marked with venom, were enhanced 
    by the twisted rage on her face. “It is his fault our children are dead.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I do not wish to challenge him. I know the 
    course of the gods. His power has waned but his mind is strong. Our bodies 
    all grow weak with age.” He dismissed her with a wave of his paw, paused and 
    watched her as she turned back to the cooking fire. Outside, heavy footsteps 
    drew near. The Chief would soon speak to the tribe through him. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Our children are gone because he dreams 
    instead of leads,” Gulnaach mewled. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Enough.” He barked. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She recoiled, but did not stop. “You are the 
    force of the gods. They thunder in your arms and veins. You are the strength 
    of this tribe. It is your right to defend him, or remove him. We grow weaker 
    with each day. We have no more food, our shelter is falling around us.” She 
    pounded on the hut to emphasize. Dirt fell in clumps, allowing more daylight 
    to pierce the hovel. “You must!” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I must do what is best for the tribe.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">She grumbled and turned away from him. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He pushed the Mite skins aside and crawled 
    out into the day. The chilling air funneled into the hovel, stoking the 
    cooking fire. Outside, his tribe huddled together beneath tattered hides for 
    warmth. The playful actions of the morning were now gone as the Sun 
    retreated behind storm clouds. The temperature was dropping and on the peak 
    above their camp, snow fell. Dnaraag made his way to Mangluuad's hut as he 
    watched the snow swirl off the mountaintop in thin ribbons. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The flaps were closed. The red fur of the 
    guardians stood in harsh objection to the snow swirling about them. As he 
    approached they stepped apart. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He was the champion of the tribe, a hulking 
    mass of muscle that defended the Chieftain. His strength came from the gods 
    and he could call on their power to smite enemies and strengthen his body. 
    He too would someday become Chief, yet not while his body still held the 
    strength of the gods. In time that strength would become wisdom, and the 
    respect he earned as high guardian of the tribe would earn him the title of 
    Chief. He wondered about that time, and how he would fare if he were in this 
    situation. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mangluuad called out from within the hut. 
    Snow fell now in a heavy blanket onto the gathered tribe. Groans and hushed 
    whispers sounded as they watched their champion go to speak with their 
    Chief. The guardians pulled aside the Mite skin flaps to allow his entry.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The chilling wind caused Mangluuad to pull 
    the hides more tightly about him. “Enter quickly, my bones are brittle, 
    champion.” Dnaraag did, and the flaps fell shut behind him. Mangluuad's mate 
    was dead, for half a year now, age having taken her. His Chief looked 
    ancient. Matted fur clung to his body in mottled, gray clumps. His cheeks 
    looked sunken in the pale light afforded by the cloud-hidden Sun. He had 
    become a shell, his eyes the last to lose the lust of life. They had a pink 
    rim about them, the color of his lips, which had begun to pull away from his 
    teeth. Age was a terrible process for them, especially for those favored by 
    the gods. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“You look at me as though you pity me, 
    Dnaraag.” The Chief spoke in raspy tones. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“There is not pity for you, Chief Mangluuad, 
    only thanks for your service to this tribe.” Dnaraag bowed his head. “A wind 
    howls from above, throwing snow on our people and hiding the Sun from our 
    sight. We have no food left to share, and have not found the human 
    settlement you dream of.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“It is there, many of our kind live there 
    now.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“But we have not seen this place, noble 
    Chief.” Dnaraag said. “We may best be served by taking the Mites home, at 
    least there will be warmth, shelter and food for a time.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“No--” the Chief snapped as a fit of coughing 
    seized him. Mangluuad's body, once as strong as his own, heaved under great 
    pressure. He feared that the tortured mask would last forever. Behind him 
    the flaps fluttered, and he barked a command to have the guards hold it 
    shut. The spasms and coughing passed. The Chief rolled to his side and 
    stared at his cooking fire. “I know it is there.” He paused and rolled onto 
    his back once more. “I will soon be dead, Dnaraag. The gods favored me with 
    a long life. You too, are like I was once.” He paused and looked Dnaraag 
    over with sorrow-filled eyes. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“I thank you for not following the wishes of 
    your mate. You have proven worthy of the gods' touch.” Mangluuad continued. 
    “I will ask one more thing from you now. Face the mountain and turn toward 
    where the Sun rises. Lead the tribe there. You will find the town. I have 
    dreamed that you will find it. But I can no longer travel with you.” 
    Mangluuad smiled. “The gods chose you well, Dnaraag. Tell them I have passed 
    and set fire to this hovel. You will lead them now, champion, and in time 
    your wisdom and the gods' touch will make you Chieftain.” </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was no protest, only agreement. This 
    was the way of their tribes. Dnaraag rose and looked upon his Chief once 
    more. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Your memory will live through me, Mangluuad.” 
    He pushed aside the flap and walked into the driving snow. Huddled in a mass 
    of fur the tribe sat in silence. The guards looked to Dnaraag and waited.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Fire.” He said loud enough for the guards to 
    hear. They left and collected burning wood from a nearby fire. Dnaraag 
    cleared his throat and began. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">“Mangluuad is no more. The High Guardian now 
    leads.” His mate trilled and smiled wickedly. “We burn his body now and send 
    him to the Sun. Pray for his soul.” He snatched a torch from a guardian and 
    touched it to the hut. Flames engulfed the hovel and spread quickly in the 
    whirling wind. Grunts sounded over the wind's howl as the tribe bid their 
    dead Chief to the gods. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dnaraag watched the flames arch into the sky, 
    whipped by the swirl of air and snow. Through the flames he saw his 
    Chieftain. Proud eyes, open, greeted the flames without fear. His voice was 
    held in check by the force of his will alone. He met the flames and his 
    death with honor, a true hero to his people. Dnaraag prayed to the gods. He 
    prayed for the strength to greet his death with as much honor when it was 
    his time, and he prayed for the soul of his mentor. As the flames licked 
    higher into the sky he bayed, and the tribe joined him in calling to the 
    gods to collect the soul of their Chief. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dnaraag rose to his feet and turned to his 
    tribe. His time was now and he would lead them, as was his Chieftain's wish, 
    into the mountains and into the human city. With the fire as his backdrop, 
    he issued his first command to the tribe: “We march!” He turned and led them 
    into the heart of the mountains.<br>
