    <td valign="top" width="442"><em><font face="Arial"><small>This out-of-print book
      became
    available in stores during the Sudden Season event<small>.</small></small></font></em><p><font face="Arial"><small>No one missed the Gelidites when they exiled themselves. They were
    never trusted by the people of Yalain, who had cast the Gelidites' ancestors down from the
    Ice Throne of Dericost in the Millennium War. The Gelidites, in turn, mistrusted those who
    occupied their lands, and sank into a cultish seclusion. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The Gelidites were obsessed with cold, perhaps because of
    their point of origin; the lofty, frozen Plateau of Gelid, upon the lip of which had sat
    Sarvien's bleak palace. They always shielded themselves from the sun with full, deep blue
    robes. Led by a &quot;Council of Three,&quot; they devoted much effort to the study and
    worship of magics most chilling. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Theirs was an apocalyptic religion, which held that one day
    the sun would dim, and world would freeze over. They believed that by studying frost-based
    magics, and developing an affinity for the cold, they could survive this great freezing.
    It is said that they planned to tunnel into a remote mountain peak, where they would erect
    a great city, to be named Frore. Intruders from the surface would be warded away by the
    bitter mountain cold and an inescapable maze of tunnels.<font color="#6B6B6B">
    SUCKS</font></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The Gelidites existed underground for most of the Age of
    Lore. After living undisturbed, if shunned, amidst the population for millennia, the
    discovery of a Lich living hidden in the mountains of Haebrous turned the public eye back
    to the Gelidites. Although there has never been any proof that the Gelidites resumed the
    proscribed arts of Dericost, they were blamed nonetheless. Many of their number were taken
    in for questioning, and others were stoned on the street. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>The oppression did not last long, however, as the Gelidites
    quickly made known the power they had amassed. The bodies of the Grand Inquisitor and his
    assistants were found melting in the square of Farimeh, frozen and shattered into hundreds
    of shards, their faces twisted into horrific masks of pain. After this, no one would
    bother them for fear of incurring further wrath - they were, after all, the descendants of
    the most reviled magicians in history. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>A few years after the death of the Grand Inquisitor, the
    Gelidites silently gathered their possessions and filed out of the cities in the dead cold
    of night, and were never heard from again. It is suspected that they went, under the
    leadership of the Council of Three (at that time consisting of the mages Fenngar,
    Frisander, and Ferundi) to excavate the ice city, somewhere in the fastnesses of the
    mountains. There have been no trace of the Gelidites, or the mythical Frore, ever since. </small></font></td>
