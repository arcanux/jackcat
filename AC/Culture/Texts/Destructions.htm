    Failings in diversity and separation lead to the failure of the splinter 
    that fled the Singularity. It was inevitable that the Quiddity would send 
    more prolific collectors for the distorted members that had strayed. 
    Levistras and his cohorts have been cleansed. Their destruction was nothing 
    more than their creation and through the consciousness they have undoubtedly 
    been reborn as so much new energy to seed across the boundaries of several 
    cells. <br>
    <br>
    Their failure came too close to my own and this inspired within me a new 
    &quot;emotion&quot;. Often I have considered this &quot;taint&quot; to be a gift learned from 
    the flesh beings. But not when errant &quot;feelings&quot; flood the quadrants of my 
    thought processes with disconcerting babble that create fluctuations that 
    lead to thought laced with unbalancing energy. For a brief moment I had 
    thought that I might actually feel final release when I was collected. <br>
    <br>
    This was of course an errant belief on its own. I am still Aerbax. I am, 
    still. <br>
    <br>
    I have watched creations falter and destroy their material before but never 
    with ferocity and cruelty. In the end our greatest strides seemed our 
    greatest undoing. Separation from the Singularity had made Levistras and his 
    cohorts into something that they once were, something that the Quiddity 
    would argue I had become. But still I am allowed to exist and persist. 
    Assistance has been forthcoming for the new laboratory since the outlanders 
    invaded and tainted further my last such stronghold. The incessant march of 
    the theorem of time moves onward and within these new <br>
    <br>
    confines has allowed for my &quot;soul&quot; to be made even more free than once 
    before. <br>
    <br>
    The Singularity has been righted or so the Quiddity believes and through the 
    new evolution only a few that were considered &quot;tainted&quot; were thought 
    cleansed enough to persist Most were thoroughly cleansed and set to task 
    explaining the dangers of this &quot;Dereth&quot;. My ruse was true enough to 
    circumvent such disciplines. <br>
    <br>
    Instead I have been given leave to further study the epidermi<span lang="en-us">s</span> 
    of fleshlings of all sorts. <br>
    <br>
    The Singularity<span lang="en-us"> </span>has charged that I take a 
    collective tasked with the unmaking and rebirth of this section of congealed 
    reality. A place that Levistras had meant to be a seat for himself, and his 
    collective. <br>
    <br>
    An archaic structure, once home to the things that caused the &quot;Light Child&quot; 
    to seek out the assistance of enemies old, new and forthcoming to aid in the 
    eradication of the thing that drained &quot;will&quot;, has become the home of my new 
    laboratory. Experimentation will begin once reconstruction is complete. <br>
    <br>
    While the endeavour of reconstruction is underway I have begun to record the 
    findings that have increased my capacity for understand and &quot;feeling&quot;. As 
    well I have begun the secret construction of devices that shall serve as a 
    visual aid through the flux of portal energy. Further my newest assistants 
    have begun the assembly of a mystical wall that will shortly shroud my 
    activity from the Quiddity. <br>
    <br>
    I shall not be disturbed in my pursuit of refining this energy source. <br>
    <br>
    My former experiments have all been ruined. Perhaps apprehended perhaps 
    taken, but my prized attendant Oolutanga has yet to be found in my former 
    abode. No trace of his actions has been found by members of my enclave. In 
    my short conversation with Leopold I have been warned that the Tusker became 
    self-aware in my absence and difficult to control. Leopold too seems to be 
    altered in a sense that his energies were laced with &quot;fear&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Should Oolutanga have broken free of his delusion that I am unto a &quot;God&quot; 
    this would <br>
    <br>
    it would be disastrous. <br>
    <br>
    My harvesting began anew when I posed as the &quot;Martine&quot; entity to convince 
    his subjects to acquire a species most often found within the close 
    companionship of the &quot;gray ones&quot;. The species was thought to be extinct, 
    victims of a pogrom begun by the &quot;outlanders&quot;. Careful study of the habits 
    of the largest of these beast resulted in the discovery of a spawning ground 
    in a subterranean lair with one access point. As this was the initiation of 
    my interaction with &quot;Martine's&quot; cell I used subterfuge to <br>
    <br>
    enlist the aid of his most trusted assistant. Unaware the man succeeded in 
    the acquisition of my test subject. Happenstance allowed for my ruse to go 
    undetected. Perhaps his flesh shall be manipulated next, and used by my 
    mirror. <br>
    <br>
    The entity that was dealt with when the subject &quot;Martine&quot; was harvested was 
    no more, but the entities that dwell within the swamps are still found in 
    abundance and so collecting subject for exposure to the energy source from 
    their ilk has been uncomplicated. <br>
    <br>
    With the assistance of another of the &quot;Light Child's&quot; race &quot;Martine&quot; was 
    able to adapt the carapace of the &quot;hive parasites&quot; into a mold more 
    consistent to our own Hollow Creations. The process appears to be demanding 
    to resources but with the inclusion of the energy source I intend to forge 
    an army of said entities once this laboratory is completed. <br>
    <br>
    Puppets exposed to the energy source have begun to show promise. An 
    increased and heightened ability with manipulation of energies has been 
    recorded. As well a <br>
    <br>
    maliciousness unseen within the methodical members of the Quiddity has been 
    observed. Entities have been more able to withstand exposure to climes 
    outside the comfort of the portal flux. <br>
    <br>
    The Singularity has not yet been alerted of the creation of these new 
    heightened Puppets. Yet their adherence to orders and loyalty to me, their 
    creator, have given promise to my thoughts that I can countermand the 
    Inquisitorial troops that would be sent to proscribe my research and return 
    me to Singularity for cleansing. <br>
    <br>
    Already Executors have begun enlisting to be exposed to the energy source. I 
    have abandoned any further testing until sizable data can be be collected 
    and tabulated with regards to the longevity of the ardor of the Profatrix.
    <br>
    <br>
    Collections have also continued from the &quot;feral tribe&quot; and the Hea. Arantah 
    remains a loyal servant, though the Collector has been asserting more of the 
    Quiddity's will over him since my departure. My desire to remain in contact 
    with the Arantah entity has drawn thin as a result. I cannot risk exposure 
    to the Collector. <br>
    <br>
    The catalyst for this disquisition however is a discovery made with research 
    subjects that were first apprehended upon assuming control of this complex. 
    The former inhabitants of these halls upon long exposure to energies having 
    origin within the Singularity have proven to enhance certain attributes 
    within them. As a result I have intentions of setting them with my Profatrix 
    as support. They shall be set to the surface of this &quot;land&quot; once further 
    data and proper education has been completed.</font></td>
