    Seedsow, 15 P.Y.<br>
	<br>
	Over the last several years, I have been happy to have the opportunity to 
	supplement my research with field work on the nature and behavior of 
	Dereth's vast variety of fauna. Along with my nephew Ardry I have observed 
	numerous creatures both humanoid and less so. I had intended to dedicate a 
	great deal of time to the study of the creatures called Mosswarts, but our 
	rivals in the Dereth Exploration Society were quicker than I and sent an 
	agent to observe their society.<br>
	<br>
	I think we all know how that turned out.<br>
	<br>
	Recently, however, I have had the opportunity to speak at great lengths with 
	a Mosswart of exceeding intellect and grace. It was already known that some 
	Mosswarts have learned to speak Roulean, but the only Mosswarts with 
	anything worth saying appeared to be those corrupted by the Virindi or the 
	Shadows. <br>
	<br>
	Imagine my surprise when my nephew Ardry claimed to have been approached by 
	a Mosswart in Hebian-To for the purpose of exchanging goods!<br>
	<br>
	I immediately demanded that Ardry assist me in tracking this intelligent 
	Mosswart. After a few days, we found him on the road between Shoushi and 
	Sawato. The ragged thing looked up at us and asked, &quot;You nice Isparians? You 
	help Bleeargh?&quot;<br>
	<br>
	After Ardry and I made camp, I had the chance to speak at length with &quot;Bleeargh&quot;. 
	Apparently the recent appearance of Burun in the Blackmire Swamp has 
	affected Mosswart society even more greatly than we had surmised. According 
	to Bleeargh, entire packs of Mosswarts are fleeing the swamp with the Burun 
	at their backs. Any stragglers are killed. Most of the packs may be headed 
	south towards their &quot;cousins&quot; - I surmise that this may refer to the altered 
	Mosswart societies on the Vesayen islands. <br>
	<br>
	Bleeargh chose to assist his pack - or &quot;family&quot; - by trading scrounged and 
	crafted goods for raw materials. He claimed to have visited several Sho 
	cities - Yanshi, Sawato, Hebian-To, Shoushi, and Tou-Tou - in search of 
	cloth and wood. &quot;To make house and clothes for Mosswarts,&quot; he said. <br>
	<br>
	I asked him if he was afraid of being attacked, and was startled by his 
	response, which I will quote in its entirety. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;Many Isparians is angry and have big weapons or magics. But Bleeargh is 
	also have magics and weapons. And Bleeargh has touched big blue rock! Now 
	when Bleeargh go to forever sleepy, Bleeargh instead show up at blue rock 
	and be very tired.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	We had suspected that many of the less intelligent creatures in Dereth had 
	used the Lifestones, but had not been aware that any truly understood the 
	ramifications.<br>
	<br>
	I asked Bleeargh to describe some of his interactions with Isparian society. 
	He encountered many different people, some of whom were honorable and others 
	who were less so. I felt great disgust when Bleeargh claimed that some 
	Isparians struck him down even as he openly begged for mercy. Savages!<br>
	<br>
	On the other hand, some Isparians did speak with Bleeargh and went as far as 
	to trade salvaged wood and cloth with him. Some offered him &quot;shiny shinies&quot; 
	by which I believe he means pyreal coins.<br>
	<br>
	A few even went above and beyond and defended Bleeargh from the pack of 
	Burun that was following him! Bleeargh was very impressed with this. His 
	eyes opened wide when he said, &quot;Some Isparian help Bleeargh fight big 
	nasties! They is true friends of Mosswarts.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Bleeargh showed me some of the carved idols that he carried with him. Both 
	were carved from the mire-covered stones which some call &quot;swamp stones.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	One set had a smiling Mosswart face carved on the front. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;These is thanking stones!&quot; Bleeargh said. &quot;Mosswarts give thanking stones 
	when we is happy because someone did nice thing for me.&quot; <br>
	<br>
	The other set had been carved with a sad Mosswart face. <br>
	<br>
	&quot;These is mourning stones. Mosswarts give these to each other when sad thing 
	happens, like death of many Mosswarts by big nasties. Sometimes when I go to 
	big blue rock, I no have as many mourning stones when I get there. This be 
	good, then Isparians can take mourning stones and be sad that they not help 
	me!&quot; <br>
	<br>
	As we were speaking, we were attacked by two Burun - Ardry believes that 
	they were scouts of some sort. He held them off as Bleeargh and I fled. 
	Realizing that he was in danger, I opened a portal to Zaikhal and coaxed him 
	through it. <br>
	<br>
	The Circle of Sages and I will be presenting Bleeargh to the Council and 
	asking that he be granted the Queen's protection as an Ambassador from the 
	Mosswart people. He is a vast source of knowledge, both on the Mosswarts and 
	on the Burun threat.</font></td>
