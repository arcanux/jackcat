      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
		<img border="0" src="img_tumerok.jpg" width="150" height="207" align="right">A dust cloud spun just outside the ring of
      the dim red-orange glow of the campfire. Wind rustled the leaves of a
      nearby tree and reminded me that the seasons were changing. Somewhere in
      the night a pod of Carenzi growled one another down.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Steam rose in thin tendrils from the soup
      cupped in my hand while I sat thinking of my home in Cragstone. A chill
      ran down my spine as my host slipped between the shadows cast by the
      firelight to take the seat across from me. His fur, dyed the color of the
      dying embers in the fire, blended all too well with the eerie glow. For
      three days we had traveled along the plateau and into the valley, for
      three nights I had watched in silence as he studied the dark horizon,
      silent and vigilant.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He was a Tonk Ona. Tumerok Scout, in our
      vernacular. I had been amongst their people only a week. My time there was
      spent speaking with their Tah, about the Olthoi, or Wharu as the Tonk
      named them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had been trying to learn as much of their
      language as I could since my trip from the town of Redspire, but the
      learning was slow. They spoke our language well, aided I think by the
      presence of three Isparian settlements on this same Isle. The Tah had
      asked what the growing presence of we Isparians meant.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the simplest terms that I could muster I
      recounted how the portals had arrived on the main body of Dereth. His
      reply was always the same, mutterings about Atua ngamaru and a tailless
      brother. I have yet to learn what these things he spoke of are but that
      was the purpose of this trip.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My guide has been eying me warily as I
      drift to sleep each night. I do not think that he mistrusts me, but it
      appears the task he has been set makes him nervous. They are unused to the
      intrusion of the humans, especially those that smell of Wharu so strongly.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had arrived in the akiekie of Timaru
      wearing the shaped head of an Olthoi. They were unimpressed and thought at
      first that I was a servitor of the Olthoi. After much protestation to the
      contrary they accepted that I was indeed Isparian. They called me Ispar
      Antiusona. I have gathered that they consider me a scout, much like my
      companion, and that I come from the tribe of Ispar. Fascinating concept.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Tonight has begun as every other has since
      the beginning of our journey. Only tonight there are no drumbeats that
      hearken away the spirits of the Wharu. We passed through the last vestige
      of their Buadren circles. My companion is a bit more jumpy but maintains
      his ever-watchful eye.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I will make sure to record the events of
      this evening with care once daylight allows. For now I think that I shall
      sharpen my okane and prepare for another fitful rest.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ispar Antiusona?” Aun Kolaona broke
      his silence of three nights. “Why have you not asked where we travel?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I was under the impression that you
      would rather not speak to me, Kolaona.” He regarded me with an
      inquisitive cock of his head.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You should not address me so. I am Aun
      Kolaona. We have not bled together yet, and as such, are not Buhdi. . .
      ” he paused. “Your people are very different, like what our brothers
      the Hea have become.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I understand, I am sorry.” I
      responded.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Do you wish to know where we go?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“If you are willing to impart that
      knowledge to me, Aun Kolaona.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I will tell you.” He nodded and
      reached into his pack to produce two apples, onga as they call them.
      “Eat with me.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As I took a bite from the apple he smiled,
      a toothy grin that twisted the tattoos on his face into an amusing mask of
      joy. He bit into his apple and I waited for his tale to begin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I am no Aua, who have been taught by the
      Nuuani of Palenqual, but I have learned well the stories of our brothers
      and sisters, the Hea.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We are of the same blood and life,
      holding dear the customs of what was once our home. We came to Palenqual
      from our home and saw the Wharu walk. We fought them and our Tah killed
      the Wharu's mistress. That was a time when we Aun and Hea were one, before
      the coming of the Atua ngamaru.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The words spat from his lips like a poison
      pulled from a wound. His eyes seemed to burn with the voracity of the fire
      before him, and he was lost then, remembering for a long moment. I made no
      effort to break the memory.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We were--are--brothers, the Hea and Aun
      Tonk. We lived together all our lives as a unified Tonkamu. Then the Atua
      ngamaru floated to our Tahs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“They tried to poison our beliefs and
      disjoin us from our stand against the Wharu. They offered your land, where
      the Ispar live, as the fruit of their gifts. But they offered that which
      they did not own.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You gave a gift and were in turn given
      your Okane.” He motioned to the dagger gifted by his Tah. “The Atua
      ngamaru wanted nothing but offered change. Our Tahs wanted nothing of
      them, and sent them away. But they were not driven away.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“They instead turned to a Puh, a Bahka,
      cast out of the Hea Xuta for transgression against the Tah. They poisoned
      his body and took his tail. They changed his face and body, to be more
      like. . . ” He stared hard at me then, and though warmed by the fire and
      the stew I felt cold. The hatred that he felt runs deep indeed. “. . .
      you.” He finished and allowed the chilling air to remain for another
      series of moments.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He discarded his apple into the darkness
      where it landed with a thump. Seconds after there came a rustling of
      feathers, a gaggle of Siraluun no doubt thinking it something alive.
      Sounds of displeasure exploded, and then faded as the Siraluun retreated
      back into the night.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Our kin of the Hea Xuta were unaffected
      for some time. Then came the return of the Puh. He wrested control from
      the Hea Tah and replaced him. Gifted by powers of the Atua ngamaru he
      displaced all that would stand before him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Spitting poison words into their
      minds he corrupted their beliefs and told them of the Ispar Dereth.
      Bringing treasures and tales of your land, he changed them. Then they went
      unto the Atua ngamaru and asked to have their tails removed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Now we are two Xuta. Separate for the
      first time.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;They wish to leave Palenqual and see
      your Dereth.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He crept across the fire then and came to
      sit next to me. I met his stony stare with the same resolve I met all such
      stares.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I take you to their border so you can
      meet them.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had not been prepared for those words. I
      had asked to learn more about their people and had been passed to another
      tribe. Dumbfounded, I spoke.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Have I done wrong?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No, Ispar Antiusona.” He shook his
      head and looked into the fire. “We love our brother/sisters. We wish you
      to know them as well.” I watched as he rose and made his way across from
      me again. He wiped a tear from his eye as he sat. “We are one but no
      longer whole.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I think I understand, Aun Kolaona.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He nodded to me then and looked back into
      the darkness outside the ring cast by our fire.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Rest, Ispar Antiusona, tomorrow we
      breach the lands of the Hea Xuta. I will take you no further once we come
      to their place. I fear their poison may enter me.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He did not look back as I nestled myself
      into my blanket and sheathed the okane. Drifting to sleep, it clicked
      within my head: Atua ngamaru. Floating demons. Cloaked ones. Virindi. The
      Tumeroks had fared the same as the Lugians.</font></td>
