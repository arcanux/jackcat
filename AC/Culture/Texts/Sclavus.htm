    <td valign="top" width="441"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>by Allan Maki,
      Turbine Entertainment Software<br>
      (found on the <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/ASHEsclavus.asp" target="_blank">Zone</a>)</i></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He cursed aloud. Peepers quieted and
      plopped into murky water, swimming away from the noise. The suction locked
      his boots deep within the mire, and the more he struggled, it seemed, the
      more tightly the swamp held his boot.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“All this for Mosswarts!” he yelled,
      scattering a flock of birds that had gathered at the rim of the swamp.
      Thick green haze funneled through the steam vents, whose source lay deep
      beneath the muck. Pockets of gas beneath the black mud opened from time to
      time, causing the stagnant water to burble and noxious fumes to rise into
      the air.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Coman was not happy that his teacher,
      Antius, had made this request of him. He hated the swamp. Like most other
      Gharu'ndim he enjoyed the arid clime of the desert. Yet he was an
      apprentice, and that meant doing the menial tasks that your mentor asked
      of you.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mire Witches, potent Mosswart spellcasters,
      had been seen amassing in the Direland swamp a fair distance outside of
      Wei-Jhou, and Antius was curious as to their intent. He had wanted to
      attend to the matter himself, but other duties kept him away on Marae
      Lassel.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, as he struggled to free his boot,
      Coman grew increasingly aware of the dangers about him. This swamp was
      home to not only Mire Witches, but also a host of Undead, Shadows, Sclavus,
      Golems and various other sorts of foul creatures. Since the Virindi had
      somehow sundered the natural order and the habitats of many of the
      creatures of Dereth, the Direlands had become an even more difficult
      region to navigate. Removing an ivory orb from his pack, Coman resolved to
      free his boots from the swamp's grasp. First, however, he needed to
      enhance his strength and harden his body, in case of assault.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As he began his first incant, his trapped
      foot slipped through into a pocket of gas. The steam rushed over his leg,
      traveled up his torso, and scorched his flesh. His cry was swallowed by
      the sound of the vent jetting its fumes into the air. He fell to the
      ground in a heap. The ivory orb rolled from his fingers into the murky
      water where it was swallowed by the darkness. Coman breathed, drawing in
      water, muck, and air as unconsciousness crashed over him in waves of pain.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pain, in hot white flashes, ripped him from
      sleep. Something was peeling the scalded flesh off his face. His left eye
      would not open and he could not move his hand to the eye to tell what kept
      it shut. His right eye stung and watered. There was something in it,
      scraping against the lid and itching the eyeball. He blinked furiously as
      the pain on his left side continued. He vaguely remembered what happened,
      preparing to cast a spell and puncturing a steam vent with his foot.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instinctively he wiggled his toes;
      something bit into his foot. He winced at first but the pain was more
      tolerable than the peeling had been. His vision began to clear as he felt
      a wet-cotton mouth open wide enough to take in his foot entirely.
      Whispered soft hisses began to rise around him. He was on his back,
      slightly inverted. The sun was setting.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">His arms and legs were strapped to a stone
      altar with thick leather straps. He had full range of movement with his
      head but his useless left eye made peripheral vision impossible. He tried
      to speak and noticed for the first time that he wheezed, a sound like
      boiling water. His throat felt weighted down, thick with phlegm. He
      coughed but the blockage would not move.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a taste of dirt and rotten eggs
      in his mouth. Grinding his teeth together he felt bits of sand chipping
      away at the enamel; he had passed out in the swamp, what had he swallowed?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A burning sensation spread from his foot
      like acid on his flesh. He looked down and saw a Sclavus, jaws extended
      lying prone, trying to swallow his leg whole. Its eyes were shut, shielded
      by a thick membrane. He kicked, twisted, and moaned softly as he tried to
      free himself from being eaten alive.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The jarring motion within its mouth forced
      the Sclavus's eyes open. Twin membranes peeled back quickly, sideways, and
      down as it blinked awake. Jaws opened further and slid off of Coman's
      foot. His boot was missing and the bare skin was covered in boils, some
      closed, others oozing fluid.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Sclavus hissed, looking lost in its
      surroundings. Its lids blinked open and closed as its head twitched side
      to side, confused. Coman whimpered and coughed again. The Sclavus reached
      for a discarded spear then, beside the slab where Coman was tethered. It
      hissed and moved to his left, just beyond his sight; he twisted his head
      to see where the thing went. Gone. He could no longer see it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He heard its hiss and a rattle. The pain
      kept his fear in check, his wits strained to their limit. There was
      nothing he could do. He had no reagents, or means of focus that he could
      feel, and his arms and legs were bound too tightly for him to break free.
      Breathing was labored and difficult, and so was the steadying of his mind.
      Silence fell over the area, save for the sound of peepers and steam vents
      coughing open in the swamp. The Sclavus must have disappeared somewhere
      behind him.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He surveyed the area of his predicament. It
      appeared to be a fortress of some kind, constructed in the most ancient
      Empyrean style. Moss thickly carpeted each of the three walls he could
      see. Vines twisted from the fetid ground to the crumbling tops of the
      battlements. There was an arch, too, unmarred by time and lacking gates;
      it afforded him a view into the swamp. Flanking the arch were two other
      Sclavus, Sata. They ignored his stirring. Expecting his tormentor would
      return, he tugged at his bonds, testing them. Each shift sent bolts of
      agony through his left wrist and ankle. Trapped.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He spat a muddy wad from his mouth and
      muttered, “This is a fine mess, Coman,” through gritted teeth.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Aste that had chomped on his foot came
      back into view, poking him in the ribs with its spear. It hissed as if
      warning him to be silent. Accepting that he would not break free he took
      more time to study where he was. To his right he saw a group of Se digging
      through his backpack. They tore scraps of clothing and studied the gems
      and jewelry within, fighting over the brightly colored ones. His staves,
      containing potent magics, were strewn some distance from the group,
      apparently discarded.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He yelled at them, not thinking of his
      current situation. A swift blow to the back of the head set his world
      spinning once again into unconsciousness.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The sun had set and night was settling in.
      His vision returned and he witnessed a small disturbance at the archway. A
      Chomu, cloaked in robes that matched the color of its reptilian hood,
      strode ahead of a band of Sata. It carried a small cauldron that steamed
      in the cool night air. To his right the Aste were growing lethargic.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chomu hissed loudly at them and they
      stirred, moving toward him in haste. One twitched on its belly, trying to
      slither. A second went back to its comrade and hoisted it up. The
      slitherer performed the same confused blink and head twitch that Coman had
      witnessed on the Aste that tried to consume his foot. The second Aste
      handed it a sword and, making sure the Sclavus on the ground was watching,
      stomped its legs. Seconds passed with no response, and the Chomu came into
      Coman's view. It struck the daft Aste in the head with its staff, as the
      second crouched and skittered away. Hissing commands, the larger Chomu
      nudged the Aste into motion. The Aste, still looking confused, moved
      along. The Chomu turned toward Coman.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The twin moons Alb'arel and Rez'arel were
      cresting the trees as the Chomu approached. The steaming cauldron gave off
      a heady scent of fungus and brimstone. Sniffing in a deep breath of air,
      the Chomu flicked its tongue over Coman's face. He closed his eye in fear
      and began to tremble. Withdrawing, the Chomu hissed to his entourage.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They carried armfuls of dried wood and
      built a fire, mechanically, as if this had been an action performed by
      rote a thousand times before. Disappearing behind him, the Chomu continued
      to hiss. Soft noises of metal on stone sounded behind Coman, like a knife
      being sharpened. He swallowed hard, and felt the wedge of mud and filth
      slide down his gullet. He fought the urge to retch and coughed violently,
      convulsing with pain as his scalded flesh was torn at the wrist and ankle.
      Opening his eye after the fit, he saw that the Chomu studied him with a
      curious interest.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Its lids slid open and shut horizontally as
      it studied his twitching form. It was. . . <i>curious</i>. Its scales were
      a muddy brown, and stiff. Deep hollows between each scale made it appear
      stony, unreal, alive but. . . somehow constructed. It breathed but it had
      no discernable smell and its breath was not warm. Like the night air it
      was cool. Coal-black eyes peered at him, with no discernable emotion,
      cold, automatic. A flame burst where the Aste worked and broke the Chomu's
      study.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Twisting its head to view the fire, it
      stepped away from him once again. Coman watched the flames lick the night
      sky, and marveled at the way the Sclavus fell into a rigid form, kneeling
      between the fire and the raised dais where he was bound. Fear swelled in
      him when the Chomu returned to view carrying the steaming cauldron in one
      hand, and a sinister knife in the other. He screamed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Help! Please, anyone help!” Death was
      nothing more than a drain on the body, but this would not be an ordinary
      death. This was a rite. He knew little about the Sclavus. He had
      encountered them in his earlier days as an adventurer in swamps but had
      never seen this behavior.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chomu moved to the front. The others
      took up positions in a wedge, perfectly symmetrical. The Sata flanked the
      Chomu, who took a position off center, leaving space for another. Behind
      the Sata, the Aste and the Se all knelt, their hooded reptilian heads
      bowed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chomu raised its hands--Coman raised
      his screaming voice. He looked to the sky where Alb'arel and Rez'arel were
      coming to their respective apexes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then there was silence, broken only by his
      panting and the roar of the fire. The Chomu knelt and held the cauldron
      and knife in outstretched hands.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He looked down and saw the twin gutters
      slanting down along the slab. As if to drain away any amount of. . .
      fluid.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Help!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The twin moons began their descent. The
      fire withered into cooling embers. The smallest Sclavus began to lay their
      fish-pale bellies flat to the ground, slithering toward the dwindling
      flames before falling finally still. Coman had watched the others hold
      their position tirelessly, waiting. Whatever they waited for did not
      arrive.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He was hoarse from crying for help. Now he
      stared into the dying night sky and pleaded once more.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chomu lifted its head and released the
      cauldron and knife. The cauldron tipped and spilled pale fungi and dark
      liquid across the mud. The knife landed blade down in the moist earth.
      Coman heard it too, a sound of footsteps, human footsteps. The Chomu moved
      quickly, tried to stir its entourage. Lethargically, the Aste and Sata
      stirred and moved with the Chomu. The Se remained unmoving. Some left
      their weapons on the ground.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Beyond the dying embers of the fire, Coman
      saw two warriors protected by heavy plate mail cross beneath the arch.
      They shredded the Sclavus ranks and fell upon the Chomu with relentless
      blows of sword and axe. When the Chomu finally fell Coman looked into its
      coal-black eyes.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They looked lost, betrayed, as though they
      had been abandoned. He had watched those eyes for hours, waiting in
      silence, for what? The lids drew shut as Coman was freed. He thanked the
      warriors and collected his scattered items. He then called upon the magics
      of the heart to mend his body.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Savage lot, those Sclavus,” one of his
      rescuers stated.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He offered a nod, staring into the corner
      of the fortress where one Aste lay coiled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Indeed.” He said. “I am in your
      debt, gentlemen. More than you know.” His saviors picked through the
      remains of the Sclavus, collecting rewards and treasures. He offered to
      summon a portal to Qal'abar for them. They accepted. Telling them he would
      be along shortly, he uttered, “<i>Roiga Thiloi</i>” and the portal
      swirled into existence.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the men gone, he cautiously approached
      the Aste. It hissed a warning and fanned its hood open, curling its head
      back as if prepared to strike. Joints prevented it from attaining the
      shape of a pure coil, but it had tried. As he approached it shifted its
      head side to side as it tracked his movements. Its tongue licked the air,
      keeping his scent.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Total regression. . . ” he remarked as
      he witnessed the Sclavus trying to wriggle beneath a crack in the wall.
      “. . . amazing.” Backing away from the creature he pulled a staff free
      and returned to the Lifestone in Cragstone.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius would scold him for failing to
      determine the reasons behind the Mosswarts' recent motivations, but the
      information he had gleaned about the Sclavus would prove invaluable.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>
		<img border="0" src="sclavus_small.jpg" width="88" height="200" align="left">The Sclavus is not a natural monster,
      but rather a magical crossbreed of serpent and humanoid. It is rumored
      that they were created ages ago by a degenerate Empyrean cult, in a failed
      attempt to construct a servant race. Four different subraces exist,
      ranging in size from four to seven feet tall. Sclavi fight viciously with
      swords and spears, and are also powerful spellcasters. Swamps, ruins, and
      deep dungeons are their homes.</i><br>
