      Where it is applicable I have added notes in par<span lang="en-us">e</span>nthesis 
      to highlight words as we would speak them in everyday tongue. <br>
      <br>
      The Falatacot, studied the art of Geomancy with an unquenchable thirst. 
      They called upon the resonance that echoed from within the world at the 
      structures erected in the time before. They found that it was here, on 
      Ireth Lassel, that mana was most concentrated, and plentiful. <br>
      <br>
      Their priestesses, used their arts to fuse snakes and servitors into 
      beings that would join them in blood rites, sacrificing unwary captives to 
      the voices that echoed from the world. Their beloved Old Ones. In the 
      places where their shrines and temples were erected, they heard the 
      voices. <br>
      <br>
      The voices granted them knowledge beyond the bounds of what any other of 
      our race had ever known and they learned the full potential of the arcane. 
      We use the shadow to our own effects when it suits us, but never to the 
      level that the true masters of the arts could, and did. <br>
      <br>
      Pulling the shadows in blankets, they hid themselves from the eyes of 
      those that would persecute. They lived in the mire of the world and 
      listened to the words that the voice called to them. Far to the west, 
      beyond the scope of Ireth Lassel they erected their homes, secluded, 
      removed and all together separate. <br>
      <br>
      Scholars all, some to a fault. They watched from afar and in time fell 
      further into the darkness. They uncovered arcane arts that even they would 
      not enact, as the cost for such was too high. Blood was life, and without 
      blood there was only death. <br>
      <br>
      In time the great cold came and forced them from their homes. They 
      wandered into the holds of their cousins, the Dericost and were tolerated 
      as they shared their arts. <br>
      <br>
      Passing carefully hidden truths to the Dericost brought about change. Yet 
      the Falatacot, held many arts secret and in darkness still. <br>
      <br>
      There in the darkness, they sequestered tomes of inordinate power and 
      enacted rites of the most foul and bloody persuasion. Killing to them was 
      another form of seeing that life continued and their rites increased the 
      power of their preistesses to a point that none save, their darkest lord 
      could comprehend. <br>
      <br>
      Sects began forming within, small splinter factions that studied the 
      aspects of the Blood of the World and called back to the voice that 
      beckoned them. Others moved further into the shadow, heeding the dark call 
      of the darkness made whole, flocking to the one who shall not be named.
      <br>
      <br>
      Others studied the arts of creation and formation. Some studied arts of 
      mechanism and toil. But all studied within the darkness and the reach of 
      that voice. Then when their veil was pierced and their world came under 
      the mighty foot of their oppressors, their tomes, and their arts fell 
      dormant. Lost to time and given over to destruction and the call of 
      entropy. <br>
      <br>
      It was here that the construction of this book would have begun, and the 
      very reason for this preface. They were a people that were brought 
      together under harsh conditions, struggling to improve that which had been 
      granted them, even whilst they were the prey to an oppre<span lang="en-us">s</span>sive 
      hunter/brother. <br>
      <br>
      They are gone, mostly forgotten. Yet there are things that they have left 
      the world that have been found by others, in different ages. <br>
      <br>
      None know how long before they were absorbed into the ranks of their 
      cousins that the Falatacot walked, and none may ever know. The knowledge 
      is occulted in the deep recesses of the world. Perhaps never to be found. 
      And though we are an old race of people. We are not eternal. <br>
      <br>
      Some have speculated that the only ones who would know the truths of the 
      Falatacot were driven from this world long ago. They flew into seclusion 
      or were hunted by the remnants of the Falatacot/Dericost in the time of 
      the one that shall remain unnamed. <br>
      <br>
      But there is another race that has lived as long as the Old Ones . But 
      they are dormant now, speaking only when their prophecy might have meaning 
      to those that will listen. Another voice, from beyond. Fed by the Blood of 
      the World but not of the Blood of the World. <br>
      <br>
      Now, there is something to be said for ages. For we live in the time of 
      the great seaborne kingdom and though I have left that place, I am still 
      of this age. But there is one that I have learned is not, of my age. <br>
      <br>
      In a time when the Unnamed walked this world, and brought his army of the 
      dark against Lord Atlan, he lived. <br>
      <br>
      He lives still. <br>
      <br>
      The Gelid <br>
      <br>
      Our race, and sects are an unforgiving lot, or so history would show those 
      with a discerning eye. It is thus that the fate of the Gelid, having been 
      only the grandchildren of the Old Dericost Lords fell under the oppression 
      of the Haebrous and we Yalain. <br>
      <br>
      I am a heretic for writing these words, but sequestered as I am within my 
      own study I do not fear the reciprocity that would be due me. Rather I 
      flaunt my hate of my own people who are so hypocritical, but I shall save 
      that anger for later. <br>
      <br>
      Nestled in the remains of their ancestors homes the Gelid studied their 
      arts on the Plateau of Gelid. <br>
      <br>
      The Haebrous discovered, and ancient ancestor of the Gelid living amongst 
      them, hidden to their arts for some time, and evidence it seems, was 
      created to support the theory that the Gelidites were somehow in league 
      with this Lich. <br>
      <br>
      The victors write history, and so one can only speculate what truly 
      transpired. But what is known to me, through the practice of certain arts, 
      and speaking with my minions from the Blood of the World, is during this 
      epoch the Yalain tortured the Gelid, while the Haebrous hunted them to 
      near extinction. <br>
      <br>
      It was in this time that a contingent of the Gelid fled Haebrous and came 
      to Ireth Lassel. <br>
      <br>
      They are departed now, nothing more than timeless corpses littering 
      hallways and eternally burning rooms within a great library. <br>
      <br>
      Introduction <br>
      <br>
      I am sure now that you have struggled through the preface you question why 
      I endeavour to entreat further information not pertaining to Elementals. 
      But please bear with me and continue your read. <br>
      <br>
      I am a man possessed of information that some have thought died with the 
      passing of the Gelid. But in reading the salvag<span lang="en-us">e</span>able 
      writings that these beings left, I have discovered that they are but a 
      branch of the Gelid, a minor sect that left to pursue the study of arts as 
      ancient as their oldest ancestors, the Falatacot. <br>
      <br>
      The tomes that existed in their libraries spanned an eon of study. Time 
      taken to think rethink, calculate and re-calculate the thoughts and 
      studies of their ancestors. They believed that the Blood of the World, was 
      nothing more than an energy, much akin to what we call mana. <br>
      <br>
      When they returned to Ireth Lassel, after years of torture and persecution 
      this sect left the whole of the Gelidites, after they enacted the rite 
      that twisted them into undead, with Dericost magics. <br>
      <br>
      This alteration, I believe would function as a most efficient punishment, 
      changed them into beings that could exist for all of time, without the 
      fear of death. Thereby they allowed themselves the freedom to study their 
      arts at their leisure and with as much depth as they could withstand. The 
      main body of the Gelid had other plans however. <br>
      <br>
      Within a few hundred years of their arrival on Ireth Lassel, the main 
      Gelid force apparently returned and set fire to their tomes, and destroyed 
      all of the Disciples of the Blood of the World. There was little in the 
      writings to suggest that there were factions but artifacts that I 
      uncovered whilst in their construction led me to believe that this is the 
      case. <br>
      <br>
      With the extinction of their kind, this information would have been lost 
      to time. Never uncovered and looked on a fable of a hidden library... <br>
      <br>
      I have discovered, in their writings that they were near a breakthrough. 
      Further they had begun construction on something that would rival anything 
      that Empyreans have ever succeeded at before. Perhaps even greater than 
      the Forges of Aerlinthe. <br>
      <br>
      Mana (The Blood of the World) <br>
      <br>
      Beneath the crust of the world, exists a lifeblood, that flows from one 
      focal point to another. Whatever came before, the Old Ones, the 
      Gromnatross, placed a series of markers, that highlighted positions of 
      immense concentration. The Gelid studied these points, by ways that I 
      cannot discern. (Several tomes are burned beyond repair and recognition.)
      <br>
      <br>
      They found that there were four poles, for lack of a more satisfying term 
      that held more power than any other. There using their command of 
      Geomantic arts they dug into the earth and created, large stone 
      structures. But the progress there was muted as they hit a point at which 
      they were rebuffed by the Bloods own essence. <br>
      <br>
      It was then they chose another approach. Utilizing their control of 
      Geomancy again, they began crafting a new column that surrounded the focus 
      of these Veins. Here they constructed huge furnaces that were meant to 
      collect the excess Blood (mana) from within the shell of the world. <br>
      <br>
      Their works were completed but the devices were never set into motion. 
      They lay dormant as of the writing of this book. <br>
      <br>
      I have visited each of these devices and felt the surge from within the 
      world itself, and will attest that there is a palpable feeling of power 
      within those places. But there is a problem with direct access to the 
      cisterns. <br>
      <br>
      Attempts to put myself into the vent, has often placed me at dangerous 
      positions, and the collection of the Blood (mana) leads to a seepage that 
      grows into tangible evidence of what the Gelid were trying to prove. <br>
      <br>
      Gelid Theory of Blood <br>
      <br>
      Their Falatacot ancestors believed that the power of the world flowed even 
      through their very veins. They would bloodlet, and sacrifice all in the 
      name of their Old Gods, to draw themselves closer to the Blood of the 
      World. <br>
      <br>
      This practice was looked on by the Gelid, but because of the alteration 
      that they made to their forms they were unable to harness the power of the 
      blood any longer. Instead their scholars spent time &quot;dreaming&quot; new ways to 
      access the Blood of the World. <br>
      <br>
      It was in the writings of one philosopher, that the Blood of the Earth was 
      made of intrinsic elements. Each one powering the different forms of magic 
      that each being could harness through teaching and craft. <br>
      <br>
      The theory went on to explain the many forms of magic that the Falatacot 
      once theorized existed. The Gelid philosopher set forth the idea, that 
      there were four that stood tantamount above all others. <br>
      <br>
      This theory became the basis for the Disciples. One that they employed in 
      everything that they would do. <br>
      <br>
      Elementary Magic <br>
      <br>
      The force of destruction, cleansing flame. The Gelid, believed that magma 
      flowing from within a mountain was nothing more than an aspect of the 
      Blood of the World. The began studying and collecting evidence as such and 
      toyed with the effects of Geomancy upon it. <br>
      <br>
      They discovered nothing. <br>
      <br>
      Books go on to explain further theories, until one theorizes the 
      possibility of a heretofor<span lang="en-us">e</span> untapped source of 
      magic. The tome crumbled to dust as I completed my translation so I 
      believe that I am the last being that knows, and perhaps will ever know, 
      the truth of how this was developed. <br>
      <br>
      If the the Blood of the World is represented in one aspect as a pool of 
      liquid magma, why is it not possible for there to be more than one of 
      these types of tangible representations. <br>
      <br>
      This theory gave rise to the Disciples own unique magic, Refracted Mana, 
      or as I have stated Elementary Magic, as it breaks the core of mana, into 
      four equal parts. <br>
      <br>
      Consumption - Fire <br>
      Stimulation - Lightning <br>
      Stasis - Frost <br>
      Decay/Entropy - Acid <br>
      <br>
      Consumption - Fire <br>
      <br>
      Consumption was the first element that the Disciples worked their new 
      magic upon. Using aspects of Demiurgy and Geomancy they plodded through 
      the thought of how to give life to that which did not live. <br>
      <br>
      Their efforts fused learned understanding of Demiurgy, creation of golems 
      and such, with their understanding of Geomancy, the working of the world 
      itself. In the end they had created a new magic, that used various aspects 
      of these two learned schools, by way of telepathically awakening the 
      slumbering shard of essence within the concentrated pool of blood. <br>
      <br>
      The first example is recounted here: <br>
      <br>
      We have sequestered a small amount of magma, taken from the balefire near 
      the Tenkarradum fault. When we reached into the syphoned aspect of the 
      worlds blood (mana) we were greeted with a question? <br>
      <br>
      Who has awakened me? <br>
      <br>
      Our response was swift and concise; we are your masters. <br>
      <br>
      This recounting showed the first effective use of all three former magical 
      aspects. They were further refined over the decades and became as swift as 
      calling forth a being to serve you by simply finding the an area attuned 
      to the basic type you needed at a moment. <br>
      <br>
      The process however was taxing. <br>
      <br>
      Stimulation - Lightning <br>
      <br>
      Stimulation was the second element that the Disciples attempted to 
      harness. <br>
      <br>
      In their creation of Elemental servitors of flame the Disciples found that 
      they drained much of themselves in the process. <br>
      <br>
      They believed that since fire was associated with destruction it was 
      hampering the recovery of their contact with the Blood. Since they had 
      theorized and come to believe that lightning was stimulus they employed 
      the same tactics upon the lightning that they had the flame. <br>
      <br>
      It worked: <br>
      <br>
      As the air sparked to life, and I called it forth to do my bidding I was 
      struck down as a charge coursed through my bones. Fortune smiled on me as 
      I remained predominantly intact and saw the form of an element composed of 
      lightning kneeling before me. However, the process still left me drained.
      <br>
      <br>
      The theory was disproven, and it was decided that the summoning and 
      binding of elementals was always going to be an experience that would 
      drain the summoner. <br>
      <br>
      Stasis and Decay - Frost and Acid <br>
      <br>
      With their experience of summoning the fire and lightning elementals 
      proving to be a drain upon them the Gelid Disciples chose to not summon 
      the beings of frost <span lang="en-us">.</span><br>
      <br>
      Though there is no written text to support the theory, I have surmised 
      that they feared that they would be locked into a stasis that would damn 
      their undead forms forever. <br>
      <br>
      Likewise, they refused to summon and bind beings of acid. Perhaps thinking 
      that they would speed the process of decay. <br>
      <br>
      Whatever their reasoning, they ceased further expansion into the realm of 
      summoning, personally. Instead their focus toward a larger scale. The 
      Cisterns. <br>
      <br>
      Cistern <br>
      Descriptions of these devices are complete to the smallest detail. They 
      were true artisans these, Disciples, and though they were never able to 
      achieve the end goal of their constructions they provided valuable 
      blueprints for any that would follow in their path. <br>
      <br>
      Each Cistern was created to be a form of battery for the creation of 
      beings of pure mana given palpable form. As such each cistern was carved 
      into the earth and reach near to the center of the world, or so they 
      believed. In my estimation the chimneys could not possibly reach that far. 
      But nevertheless they are some of the deepest structures that I have ever 
      seen. In each of<span lang="en-us"> </span>these cisterns, quarters were 
      developed for the overseer. Though they were never used they were stocked 
      with magical devices that would grant the overseer protection from the 
      harshness of being in such close proximity to the distilled Blood (mana). 
      There was a minor cost, but it was a pittance when compared to what these 
      overseers would command in terms of power. <br>
      <br>
      The Cisterns, would need an imprint. <br>
      <br>
      I have gathered through what knowledge I have been able to garner in this 
      place, and my understanding of Dericost magic that an imprint is a mind, 
      or memory that would be responsible for controlling the beings summoned 
      forth from the Blood. Alternately an imprint can be thrust onto or into an 
      object to store individual or shared memories. Abstract in function, such 
      rituals could truly serve a grand purpose. I will p<span lang="en-us">u</span>rsue 
      in a later treatise. <br>
      <br>
      For the Disciples, the Overseers would be that imprint, those that 
      controlled each aspect of the Blood of the World. The power that they 
      would command would be akin to what the Old Man possesses. <br>
      <br>
      And therein lies the rub. <br>
      <br>
      Each of these Cisterns would be capable of creating an army of aspected 
      beings that listen to the clarion call of one mind. Four minds that would 
      control the embodiment of the Blood of the World. <br>
      <br>
      Their society, from what I have ascertained was one that was based on 
      unbelievable trust and companionship. There was an implicit belief that 
      each was bound to the other in an unending circle of devotion that would 
      keep them safe from outside interference and corruption. <br>
      <br>
      Their destruction within their great library and the halls beyond are 
      evidence to the contrary. <br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the four overseers never took their positions and the 
      cisterns lay dormant for the countless years between then and now. <br>
      <br>
      Application <br>
      <br>
      I have taken my residence in each of these places, these Cisterns, and let 
      the power of the Blood of the World flow through me. In the Temple of the 
      Aspect of Flame I have encountered several of these beings of flame. They 
      did not recognize me as anything other than a violator of the secret pacts 
      drawn long ago with their Disciple masters. <br>
      <br>
      My first excursions into their holds were met with resistance and I balked 
      at pressing them, and beginning a battle with them. I do not doubt that 
      Heiromancy could be used to destroy the lesser beings, or even the greater 
      beings, but I had an alternative method that I could attempt to use. <br>
      <br>
      The Disciples had given me all the knowledge that was necessary to create 
      and bind my own elementals to me, but I was unsure of the havoc that it 
      would wreak upon my being. So I had treaded on the side of caution until a 
      time I saw fit to test their arts to see what would come of it. <br>
      <br>
      I could not have been more impressed, surprised, or pleased by the results 
      of my first and every subsequent meeting. <br>
      <br>
      I have slowly but surely brought all of the beings of fire under my sway, 
      and have begun entreating those of lightning as well. The process is 
      taxing, but my living matter regains strength much faster than the 
      Disciples, who in their undead state appear to have suffered a much 
      greater drain. <br>
      <br>
      In time I should be able to bring all of these cisterns into functional 
      use and thereby create an army of these beings that will heed my call and 
      do my whim. <br>
      <br>
      (Translators note: Here there is a discrepancy of time, the writer goes on 
      to explain events that seem to have happened a great many years in the 
      future. There is a noticeable leap in logic that suggest that there are 
      companion tomes to this one. The writer alluded to one such tome, in a 
      previous passage when he mentions pursuing knowledge of &quot;Imprinting&quot; 
      perhaps there is more to be found?) <br>
      <br>
      The cisterns function very well. I have imprinted the orders from my mind 
      into a powerful receptacle and begun the harvest of the pure force of mana 
      from within the world. The teachings of the Disciples were adequate, but 
      my further study have granted me a depth of understanding that they were 
      never able to achieve. <br>
      <br>
      I have even seen the fusion of aspects of the mana coalesce and join 
      before my eyes. These beings are more intelligent, free-willed as well, 
      but they are still well within the realm of my control. <br>
      <br>
      At this point, my treading with the fire and lightning aspects of the mana 
      have proven most beneficial. They call me by name upon their summoning now 
      and are beginning to show some indication of being linked to the Blood 
      even though they are separated from it. <br>
      <br>
      It has also become apparent, through a somewhat disconcerting mean, that 
      more powerful beings from the mana are capable of bringing forth lesser 
      beings of their aspect. Though they are less intelligible and powerful 
      then their greaters, they are not bound to my will directly and this is a 
      practice that I have taken to quashing amongst the few that I have seen do 
      so. <br>
      <br>
      I have spent many years now within these cisterns, preparing for the 
      revenge that is do my brother. I grow in power each day and though the 
      frost and acid beings are slow to mature, I have seen progress. <br>
      <br>
      My travels have also lead me to a new hold, one far greater than the 
      cisterns themselves. <br>
      Here I will be able to see the rise of my army, so that I may right what 
      was done wrong. <br>
      <br>
      He shall pay. <br>
      <br>
      (Again there is a discrepancy of time, this seems to allude to the period 
      just before what we have come to know as the flight of the Empyrean.) <br>
      <br>
      Pretentious fool. They come because of him. My brothers killers, they have 
      begun pouring over our lands devouring all that comes in their way. <br>
      <br>
      I had just brought the embodiment of my armies into my citadel...and the 
      Olthoi poured through the temple gates. Each of the cisterns is overrun, 
      the rituals intact but the imprints have been destroyed shattered, and 
      fallen. <br>
      <br>
      My army fights now to see that they survive, and in those places where 
      they are summoned still my other servitors will defend. But in time they 
      will be destroyed. <br>
      <br>
      <span lang="en-us">I</span> must strike now, while the iron is hot, drive 
      my hate into him and see him brought low to be justly accused of his 
      transgression. His crime. His murder. <br>
      <br>
      I am coming for you Old Man... <br>
      <br>
      You shall be judged for D <br>
      <br>
      (Translators Note: It can be assumed that the author intended to complete 
      his sentence, but there is nothing more to suggest he had the chance. The 
      lack of bloodstains suggests that they simply stopped. There is a blot of 
      ink that rests near where the next letter would have begun but there is no 
      way to determine what the intended word was to to be. A proper name, 
      perhaps a named crime. Regardless, the abrupt break suggests that the 
      author simply stopped writing, was forced to stop writing or other foul 
      befell them.) <br>
