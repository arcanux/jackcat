      from Jersen the Jolly <span lang="en-us">Barkeep </span>in MacNiall's 
    Freehold<span lang="en-us"> - 74.0S, 92.2E</span></font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is difficult to remember
      the circumstances of our escape from the Olthoi horde, many years ago. The
      initial rush out of the caves was a night of chaos. It was only the
      strong, stable presence of our leaders, the Aluvian cousins MacDugal and
      MacNiall, that kept our small band together that perilous night. A few
      individuals were left behind or struck out on their own. The cries of pain
      we heard were enough to convince us to stay together. Only when we were
      out of the mountains and in the forests, the scrabbling and skittering
      sounds of Olthoi pursuit absent, that we stopped to rest and breathe free.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It was then that we saw the
      portal in the distance, in the mountains from which we had just fled. The
      portal wavered, showing signs of instability. MacNiall wanted to take the
      portal and see what was on the other side. MacDugal was plainly skeptical
      of the portal, reminding us all that it was a shifty portal that had
      originally gotten us into years of Olthoi slavery. The two of them argued
      for some time, with the rest of us voicing our support for one or the
      other. I suppose the commotion our argument caused attracted the attention
      of the Olthoi. A group of Olthoi soldiers fell upon us.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In our surprise, we were
      unable to meet the attack and a few more brothers and sisters fell under
      their claws. In the chaos, MacNiall called out for people to rally to him
      as he ran for the portal. MacDugal, for his part, gathered some people as
      he ran for the foothills. I and several others followed MacNiall through
      the portal. What became of MacNiall, I cannot say. I can only hope that he
      and my friend Shi Ki-Yong and even the abrasive Jourgensson found a safe
      refuge in the foothills.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what we
      expected to find when we came out of the portal. Certainly not this
      isolated tropical archipelago. As soon as we were assembled and had had
      some time to rest, MacNiall set us about exploring the surrounding land.
      We were unable to locate any portals to the mainland, but we found another
      band of refugees fleeing the Olthoi. They were led by Zenzaburou Hensu and
      Vesayen Hylin. Obviously it made sense to pool our efforts to settle
      together on the island, especially after our scouting efforts revealed the
      presence of many hostile creatures, unknown to the experience of any.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Unfortunately our attempt
      at a shared settlement failed. Zenzaburou and Vesayen insisted on strict
      submission to the tenets of Jojiism and the Code of Pwyll, which most of
      us under MacNiall found impractical and unnecessary. Arguments raged day
      and night, and finally MacNiall decided that he could no longer live with
      the traditionalists and their unthinking adherence to outdated moral
      codes. We, who had been with MacNiall since our escape from the caves,
      went with him to settle elsewhere. We took with us our rightful share of
      supplies and set out, weapons at the ready for whatever came our way.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We made our way to this
      small island, ideal for our purposes. It is defensible and isolated from
      most of the creatures that plague the rest of the islands. The first days
      of our time here were difficult, and we lost a few more brothers and
      sisters in arms to the claws and spells of creatures, most notably the
      uniquely malodorous Moarsmen and the legions of powerful undead on the
      island farthest east. But through all our challenges, we have survived and
      thrived. More importantly, we never surrendered our principles under the
      pressure of the traditionalists.</font>
