      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My Lord Anadil, esteemed
      peers, and captains of the alliance, I send you greetings and news.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After much research and
      observation, my agents and I have discerned much truth about the Yalaini
      method of storing the shattered array. I will caution my colleagues,
      however, that there remain large and potentially dangerous gaps in our
      knowledge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As we knew before, the
      crystal array used by the Yalain Council shattered into its six component
      pieces when the Servant was contained. Each piece was, in some sense,
      under the control of the Servant. For this reason, each attempted to dig
      itself into the ground upon coming to rest. Doubtless this was an attempt
      to evade the detection of his captors. One of these pieces was thrown as
      far as Aerlinthe, and the Lady Aerfalle observed soldiers of Yalain
      recover and send it oversea. We believe this was the core piece that was
      found sealed in the Nexus facility, where the component pieces of the
      array were grown in the first place. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Of the six pieces, the
      Yalain appear to have recovered five. The missing piece, thanks to the
      explorations of the outlanders, we now know to have landed in the
      mountains to the west of Velacixque, where it dug itself into the ground.
      It was later found by a small group of our descendants, and their
      experiments on it ultimately led to their destruction, and the present
      crisis.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The energy released by the
      planar rupture that trapped the Servant also destroyed the Council (save
      Asheron Realaidain of Knorr, whose means of survival remain unknown to
      us), one of the Thorns, and the mass of the Spawn army - hundreds of
      thousands of Dark Spawn, if the reports of our agents were to be believed.
      This decimation of the enemy's forces, when combined with the loss of the
      Servant, effectively ended the war. The mass of their power in the world
      was penned, and much of the remainder destroyed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Servant's generals
      appear to have been, like their lord, too powerful to be destroyed by mere
      explosion. Note it took the concentrated efforts of the entire Yalaini
      Council to put the dark witch Elithra down at the battle of Dernehale. The
      generals appear to have been, for lack of a better explanation,
      &quot;dispersed.&quot; That is, their physical forms were destroyed. Their
      consciousnesses seem to have survived. How they accomplished this, and
      where they have been in the meantime, remain open questions. There is no
      question that they have returned. The recent sport they had with the
      outlanders proves it, though they seem not to have recovered their
      previous strength yet.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have walked the ash of
      the titanic crater that marks the site of the war's end. It is still
      blackened and barren, with only that repulsive fungus able to survive. The
      ash stirs restlessly in the breeze, and the rumbling of magical thunder
      can be heard even in clear daylight. The currents of mana in the area are
      still profoundly disturbed. However, with careful study, my comrades have
      been able to isolate certain magical harmonics in the peculiar, humming
      crystals created by the explosion.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">These crystals share some
      form of connection with the Soul Stones that once formed the Council's
      Array. My studies into the geomancy of the ancient Falatacot proved quite
      fruitful here. We have, to be brief, been able to use harmonics of the
      crystals in the wasteland to discern the approximate locations of an
      additional three pieces of the array, by divining their telltale aural
      vibrations. They would seem to have been locked in special storage
      facilities, deeply buried in the earth and protected from detection by
      various magical wards. The Yalain never possessed much ability at
      geomancy, so I doubt that these are decoy facilities.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I regret to say, however,
      that my agents sent to search these locations for possible methods of
      entry have not found any. They have encountered large numbers of the
      Spawn, which forces me to conclude that the Enemy is also aware of the
      Yalaini facilities. It is perilous to think, but they may indeed have
      gained access to one or more already.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It now becomes a race, my
      colleagues. We must find these facilities first.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I would also note that with
      this discovery, we still have no information on one of the Soul Stones. My
      agents continue to scour the islands with methods both magical and mean. I
      have left instructions that finding this last Stone should be our top
      priority.</font></td>
