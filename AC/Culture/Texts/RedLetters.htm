      "The day of the picnic was quite sublime. Men and women relaxing in the sun, much food and drink and merriment to be had by all. I dare say it would have been an unqualified success if those unpleasant Skeleton Warriors with their bows
      hadn't showed up."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Sir Saladur ibn Andoun, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Holtburg&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "To the laymens point of view, Banderlings are nasty and brutish creatures who are fit only to serve as a source of scalps and masks. Such a perspective ignores the beauty hidden within their ferocious demeanors. I have never seen a bond so strong amongst the humanoids here as a Banderling with its young."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Olivier Rognath, Friend to the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lytelthorpe&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "Drudges, unlike their Banderling cousins, deserve all the scorn heaped upon them. They are thieving, lying, sniveling pieces of filth. I am sure I am not alone in expecting to feel secure in hanging ones wash on ones clothesline. Maybe when the Drudges see fit to return my underclothes, I will see fit to not obliterate every Drudge specimen I come across."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Olivier Rognath, Friend of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Nanto&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "While I was journeying in the Vesayen Isles, I came across a circle of Shadow Children kneeling and singing to some invisible force. I have never been more unsettled in my life. Shall Eternity be marked thus, if BaelZharon has his way?"&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Madam Ainea Besu, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rithwic&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "Of course I encouraged Malif in his strange passion for Ursuin wrestling. It was the only way I could manage to be alone with the delectable
      Akada.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Sir Saladur ibn Andoun, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Samsur&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "I find the Niffis to be the most cogent argument that I can muster for evidence of the One having a sense of humor. Sir Andoun, as he is most prone to tell you, sees the matter differently."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Madam Ainea Besu, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shoushi&nbsp;</b><br>
      <br>
      "According to Sir Alayne, there have been numerous reports of organized Mosswarts located west of Sawato. I am glad that, despite our recent differences, Sir Alayne has seen fit to entrust this important exploration to me."&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      - Sir Candeth Martine, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Yanshi Stamp: "In one of our more recent Society meetings, a man told me how excited he was to begin researching and cataloging the beautiful Phyntos Wasps. Apparently, they seem to be as delicate as butterflies. He is new to Dereth. He will learn." -- Madam Ainea Besu, Explorer of the Society&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Yaraq&nbsp;<br>
      </b><br>
      "Why do I hate Armoredillos? Once upon a time, I had waged a long and arduous campaign to win the heart of the inestimable Hajima. Overcoming many miles of separation, slanderous rumors, and an inflexible husband, I was in sight of successfully wooing my hearts desire. The scene was perfect: a remote desert tent set in the gentle moonlit sands, fine wine, food full of spice and bite, a soft candlelit glow...until that loathsome little...bah, it infuriates me even now. Needless to say, I possess many fine Armoredillo Spines."&nbsp;<br>
