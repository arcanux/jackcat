    Posted on the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=144">
    Turbine</a> site during the
    <a href="../Dereth/Waking2.htm">Waking 
    From the Abyss</a> event (Dec. 18, 2003).</font></span><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">She paced at the edge of the room, running a 
    hand along the wall as she walked back and forth. She had eaten well for the 
    third day in a row, and Antius was beginning to see the strength returning 
    to her. She had awoken a changed woman. She said little of the dreams that 
    she had while feverish, but she assured him that he would be told when the 
    time was right.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They had discussed Antius’ theory on who the 
    would-be-assassin might have been, and though she agreed with his 
    supposition she knew that there was little recourse without proof and 
    without a way to exact a punishment. They spoke about how the Council would 
    proceed and how the masses had fared against the Olthoi Queen. She had 
    seemed disappointed that the Queen still lived, but there was little that 
    could be done about that now. He wasn’t sure, but Antius believed he had 
    seen a hint of pleasure in her eyes when he informed her that Nuhmudira had 
    succeeded in only driving the Ancient Queen away from Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the three days since she had stirred, they 
    had discussed a great many topics. She seemed filled with a renewed sense of 
    yearning and desire. She wanted to visit with the monarchs who comprised the 
    people. They redrafted the Council on paper and arranged for a meeting to 
    discuss the future with the current members. She asked about Asheron only 
    once; when she was told that the old mage had not been seen since his island 
    was freed from the Olthoi invasion force and not heard from since they had 
    entrusted Nuhmudira with working with him, she only nodded her head and 
    returned to work.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa was different.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As she paced now, she outlined a new goal of 
    visiting the townships through Osteth, reinforcing their position, creating 
    incentives for the vendors, restructuring monarchies. Her ideas were coming 
    faster than Antius could write.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elysa,” he smiled and placed his writing 
    quill on the table. “I cannot continue at this pace, and you should really 
    rest.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius, I rested for over a month. In that 
    time, the festival season has begun and now draws to a close. I refuse to 
    allow this year to end without setting these ideas to parchment.” She smiled 
    as she walked toward him, “If your hands are not up to the task of recording 
    what I speak—Asheron.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Asheron?” Antius asked.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The old mage appeared in the doorway and 
    bowed his head. “I apologize for not coming sooner Ely. I was unable to be 
    with you, but it appears that you have driven the Olthoi away—”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Not I.” She paused, and beckoned him to sit 
    in a chair opposite her own. As he sat, Antius stood to greet the wizened 
    man with a bow. “It was Nuhmudira.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Nuhmudira,” Asheron questioned. “How?”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We assumed that the poisons that you and 
    she—“ Antius began.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Poisons? Antius, the last time that I saw 
    Nuhmudira was during the council meeting prior to the invasion of my 
    island.” Elysa leaned her chair back onto two legs. Antius bowed his head 
    between his hands while Asheron looked between the two.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius slammed his fist into the desk, “That 
    conniving b—“</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Now, now…” Elysa lowered her chair back to 
    the ground. “She did very well in veiling her machinations, and had the 
    assassin’s poison done its work, it appears she would have removed Asheron 
    as well. There is a reason they call her the <i>Monster in the Labyrinth</i>, 
    Antius. She’s conniving and treacherous, and this certainly is evidence that 
    she may have been behind the attempt on my life but –”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Attempt on your life?” Asheron broke in, 
    “Elysa, I had no warning, no word…how long ago?”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius looked toward Asheron, “Shortly after 
    Nuhmudira <i>met </i>with you for the last time.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Asheron ran a hand through his long beard, “I 
    can easily scry upon—“</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Elysa raised a hand, “Asheron, I would ask 
    that you do nothing.” She smiled. “You told me once, that when I needed you 
    most you would not be there for me. You were right…” She slid forward in her 
    chair and leaned across the desk to take the old man’s hand. “But I learned 
    something very important, Asheron, and I don’t mean to offend you by saying 
    what I am about to say.” Asheron’s demeanor changed, his quizzical 
    expression melted away to one of recognition. This moment had been building 
    for years. “I’m grateful that you were there for me after Thorsten’s death. 
    I’m more grateful for the kindness that you have shown the wayward children 
    of Ispar. Without you, our lives would be filled with great suffering. But—”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They discussed how best to part for hours. 
    The autumn sun turned red, then orange and finally lavender, as it fell 
    below the horizon. The fire was lit and food was delivered as they recounted 
    their first meeting, Borelean’s birth and Asheron’s discovery of how to 
    create the lifestones. They shared thoughts on how best to deal with 
    Nuhmudira. Twilight turned to night and they decided that Asheron would 
    remain one of Borelean’s tutors, but his presence on the Council was no 
    longer necessary. He vowed that he could be called upon whenever he was 
    needed, but he agreed that Elysa was correct: they each had obligations that 
    needed to be met. As he prepared to leave, Asheron told Elysa that he would 
    delve deeper into Knorr, in hopes of one day freeing the school for the 
    Isparians and Empyrean alike.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After he was gone, Antius and Elysa talked 
    for a great while about Nuhmudira. They decided that the Council needed to 
    be summoned, but for the moment, the information that they possessed about 
    the <i>Monster in the Labyrinth</i> would be best kept secret.</font></td>
