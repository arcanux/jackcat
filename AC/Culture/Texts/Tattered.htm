      &quot;Ah yes, this is interesting. This came from a Mu-Miyah, you say. Curious. 
      This would seem to be some sort of memoir.&quot;</font><br>
      <font color="#00FF99">Kuyiza bint Zayi the Translator gives you Mu-Miyah

      </font><font color="#FFFF99">Kuyiza bint Zayi the Translator tells you, &quot;I 
      wonder what would provoke such soul searching? Although I have noted that 
      the undead seem prone to rambling reminiscence... I suppose when one is 
      that old, it becomes inevitable.&quot;........................</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have been on many
      campaigns with my chieftain Anadil over the millennia. He selected me
      personally from among the warriors of my clan. The hidden lords of
      Dericost had their hands deep into our people then. In the subjugation of
      us, they came to respect and admire our warriors. It once was said that,
      man for man, none could best the nomads of the high desert.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The service of our
      chieftains the Dericost especially coveted, for, unlike most of their
      living generals, they held no scruple in battle. It was always a strange
      thought to us that anyone could do any less than whatever is necessary to
      achieve victory. I have also heard it said that, because we had always
      lived on the move, we were far better at raiding and fast-moving warfare.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I know not if this was
      actually true, but it sounds likely. As more of our chieftains proved
      their loyalty to the Ice Throne, more were blest with conversion to
      Mu-Miyah, the only form of thinking-death in which the body does not decay
      at all, but is well and truly eternal. In time, we commanded all the
      finest companies of Dericost.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I participated in many
      raids against the Yalain and Haebrous during the Last War, and proved
      myself in combat time and again. At Harebach Crose, I captured the
      standard of Relmontaine, and was highly praised by Ilkanne herself. At
      Berkesh I fought the Yalain captain Machus Sencara in single combat, and
      brought back his head to hang from our company's standard. The skull still
      hung there on the morning we fought at the foot of Gelid.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We knew the Yalain and
      Haebrous were coming. We had shadowed their army for hundreds of miles as
      they bludgeoned their way through the living armies the Dericost lords set
      before them. We had long since known their exact numbers, and what famed
      warriors were present, and who commanded the left, right, and center. We
      knew how the army would deploy and where it would attack. We would hold
      them off easily. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So we held them off,
      easily. They attacked in thick fog on one of the coldest mornings I can
      remember. The skin of the lesser thinking-dead cracked and broke away as
      they marched. For hours, all I could grasp of the battle was the sound.
      Men and women screamed in pain and fury, the metal clashed and clanked,
      support arms whirred and whistled, and mage-fire crackled.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As the mist burned away
      that fateful morning I was witness to a stirring vision. There among the
      snow and battle stood a woman clad in white, with long golden hair
      spilling over her shoulders. With the tip of a flaming silver sword she
      drew a circle around herself, and coolly smote any Firstborn who dared
      cross it. I stood among the great captains, beneath our proud banners, and
      watched her.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She fought for hours, and
      slew many of the mighty among our company. By the time the sun had reach
      its apex, her white raiment was horrifically soiled with blood and gore.
      She did not seem to notice. She was splendid to watch, so graceful and
      untiring she seemed inhuman. I have rarely seen one outside our own tribes
      so completely devoted to the warrior's arts, and none of us could
      withstand her. She was, I later learned, Leikotha, an esteemed chevaird of
      Haebrous. At the time, however, all I heard of her was Nerash’s murmur,
      &quot;She is beautiful, is she not?&quot; Of course, we all know how that
      story ended.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Not that it mattered on the
      field that day. While the Kings tenaciously held the gates to Gelid,
      Alaidain and Jailne, alone, wound their way through the Vasmora, entered
      the palace, and slew Sarvien the Foolish. For that infamous defeat, the
      Sand Kings of the high desert were shunned by their own people. Honor
      demanded atonement for failing to protect their charge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The surviving Kings
      recouped their honor at Ayn Tayan, but by then the world had changed. Our
      conquerors had been too scarred by the war to consider any possible fate
      for us but the torch. We were not men who had surmounted death, and paid a
      heavy price for the honor; we were abominations and monsters. The Kings
      had gone with the Lords to Killiakta, joining the Winds in their hidden
      redoubts. By the time atonement had come, our descendants had been taught
      by Yalaini missionaries to think of us as they did.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I carry two things with me
      now. One is my honor, which I redeemed at the Hill of Pines. The other is
      my sword, with which I hope to serve the generations that may be. I
      understand too well the tragedy of the Frorites, trapped forever now in
      their drafty citadel. They can never go home. Even if they should, what
      remains for them there? The few dozen of them that remain, and the empty
      cities of old Dericost?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My people, like theirs, are
      gone. There are no more herds and tribes wandering across the high desert.
      There is only silence and the wind, where once my people sang under the
      stars.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I doubt the Winds and Lords
      will ever truly understand what they have lost. But lately, while lurking
      in the dark beyond the campfires of the Isparians, I have heard them sing
      of their world's stars.</font></td>
