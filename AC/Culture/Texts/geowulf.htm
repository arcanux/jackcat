	<br>
	Branwyn and I had an argument earlier this day. My father is growing more 
	sickly with each passing day and soon will reach the point where not even a 
	lifestone could revive him. I want to move to Glenden Wood to be near him 
	during what may be his final days. But Branwyn, so wrapped up in her market 
	stand, doesn't want to leave Arwic for fear of the lack of income. Glendon 
	Wood stands to be a very profitable town, I know of several allegiances that 
	call it home. I doubt she would miss a pyreal there. But alas she remains 
	adamant. I love her, but at times she can be so uncaring.<br>
	<br>
	After our argument, I promptly left the cottage and made my way to Glendon 
	Wood to visit father. Aunt Wyna does good looking after him, but I am sure 
	she would like a reprieve once in a while. I brought father his monougat 
	(Auntie Wyna would skin me had she seen me sneak him those) and the most 
	recent Crier's Ballot to read. Home bound as he is, he relishes the 
	opportunity to hear of the world.<br>
	<br>
	Bidding both father and Auntie Wyna farewell for the day, I returned to 
	Arwic and then made my way to the mountain pass. A trail I am all too 
	familiar with, but I enjoy the hike. The wintry air clears my thoughts. 
	Something well-needed given the events of earlier in the day.<br>
	<br>
	I worked my way west along the Lost Wish ridge. I ran across some comrades 
	from Arwic who were hunting mattekars for their fur trade. They've invited 
	me to stay the night at their cottage in Colier View Hill. The small cottage 
	was crowded but the fire was cozy and the company friendly.<br>
	<br>
	Journey Log 2<br>
	<br>
	Biding my friends farewell, I embarked north towards MacDugal' stronghold. 
	Normally I avoid that sort, but I was short on bandages, and an adventurer 
	never enters the wilds without his healing kits.<br>
	<br>
	My thoughts drifted to Branwyn as I passed one of the Tremblant standing 
	stones. I had brought her there three years ago, just before we married. We 
	camped on the hill behind the stone and watched the sun rise, and set, over 
	the mountains. We were only pestered by a lone mattekar, but it was only 
	interested in seeing what we were doing, not causing any damage. I wonder if 
	Branwyn is still upset.<br>
	<br>
	I took my midday meal at the border of the blighted lands and the end of the 
	Lost Wish mountains. The Olthoi have done horrible things to that land. 
	There are only but a few pristine locations left in that valley, though 
	those are often guarded by things worse than Olthoi.<br>
	<br>
	I arrived at the Halian cottages shortly before sunset and just in time to 
	meet up with more fellows. They were planning to spend the evening lightning 
	fireworks and watching the borealis, and happily invited me to join them for 
	the evening. Another evening of entertainment and cramped quarters with good 
	friends. I shall walk the shores tomorrow and then return to Arwic to me 
	beloved Branwyn. Hopefully we can discuss the matter of Glenden Wood and my 
	father with more civility than we had two days ago.<br>

	<br>
	I must admit that I am somewhat impressed with my resourcefulness. I 
	scavenged through the debris littered about the gut of the leviathan and 
	happened across a scepter. It possessed just enough magic to strike a flame 
	upon the corroding drift wood<br>
	<br>
	Needless to say, fire within the belly of the beast was not well taken and I 
	was shortly expelled upon this unknown shore. My head still spins from the 
	blow I received after the beast promptly spat me out. My injuries have 
	prevented me from making any attempts at a rudimentary recall escape.<br>
	<br>
	Strange trees the likes of which I have never seen. Niffis shells, as well 
	as the shell of creatures I have never seen before, lay scattered across the 
	land.<br>
	<br>
	I happened across some Mosswarts, much to my surprise. They are wary of my 
	presence, though I get the distinct impression that they would think much 
	more highly of me with I were to bring some &quot;Stot&quot; or &quot;Wantir Lacker&quot;, 
	whatever those are.<br>
	<br>
	Journal Log 6<br>
	<br>
	The Mosswarts have driven me from their village and I am now lost. I've 
	found this temple, but I cannot stay here. The lower levels host a multitude 
	of things skittering about in the dark, always lurking along the edge of my 
	vision, but always dashing away as soon as I turn to meet them in the eye. 
	The upper levels are haunted by the undead.<br>
	<br>
	The cadavers and other worm-ridden shamblers of this place have driven me to 
	this small room. I've managed to barricade myself within this small room, 
	but the undead wail against the door, moaning for a sacrifice. There will be 
	no sleeping here, though with each passing hour I grow drowsy.<br>
	<br>
	This cannot be my fate, my last hours. My last words with my beloved wife 
	cannot be those of ire. I dare not submit myself to the motives of the 
	undead in these ruins. Rumors speak of undead capable of severing ones bond 
	to a lifestone and I dare not risk such a death, not when others could 
	arrive. The mosswarts could come... they could bring their king Argram 
	Unkpresank.<br>
	<br>
	Journal Log 7<br>
	<br>
	Their efforts have doubled and the doors bend under the stress of their 
	attacks. My treated kits cannot fix the concussion I have, merely treat my 
	scrapes and bruises. There is not hope of surviving this I am afraid.<br>
	<br>
	I accept this now. But I will not go without a fight. I mean to take several 
	of them to the grave with me before they get my heart.<br>
	<br>
	Branwyn, should this ever find its way into your hands, please know this - I 
	love you with all my heart. I have always loved you. I'm sorry that we never 
	got the chance to live our lives together longer than we have.<br>
	<br>
	Tell Auntie Wyna what happened. Tell her and my father that I love them.<br>
	<br>
	The door is shattering as I write these last lines. I must arm what few 
	traps I have and steel myself for this fight.<br>
	<br>
	Always with love,<br>
	<br>
	Geowulf</font></p>
