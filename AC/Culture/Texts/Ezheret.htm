    As observers it is ever our first priority to remain unseen, mindful that 
    contact with these races could alter their culture in a way that would be 
    infinitely damaging. To that end the Collegium Ingae Fatae has devised 
    potent rites cast upon our excursions prior to travel through the portal 
    flux. It has ever been my position to ensure that the weave of the spell 
    does not falter on worlds where the potency of magic is dampened. Since the 
    piercing of our veil on Ezheret we have redoubled our efforts and 
    implemented new techniques to ensure that we are not seen. <br>
    <br>
    Yet I cannot help wondering if what happened on Ezheret has deeper import 
    than we have given credence. Since the discovery of portal travel there have 
    been experiences felt by myself and others that can only be described as 
    &quot;reliving&quot;. As though the moments that are playing out before us are 
    predestined or have previously occurred. This predetermination has no 
    bearing or direct correlation to divination and so I am unwilling to think 
    that these are mere instances that I had seen in a vision, nor are they 
    hallucinations. <br>
    <br>
    Ezheret is a moon world capable of supporting several species. Three of 
    these species appear to have better than animal intelligence, capable of 
    crafting rudimentary tools and sustaining a limited form of speech in the 
    lesser of these forms to the ability to speak in a tongue that we were able 
    to learn quickly through the greater. <br>
    <br>
    Perhaps the most interesting of these species were the Tonk, the 
    good-natured creatures that pierced the illusions and fell to their knees in 
    worship of us, promptly corrected. These peoples appeared to have seen us 
    before, several of their structures appeared to be influenced by the 
    architecture once prominent on Ireth Lassel, though certainly more crude and 
    rudimentary. The basis for their art and their understanding of magic as a 
    tribal gift from the gods that sang throughout the cosmos, as they referred 
    to the suns, was also reminiscent of our first steps into grasping magical 
    talents. <br>
    <br>
    Yet, there had been no logged instances of travel to Ezheret. Some scholars 
    here at Knorr have begun discourse over the possibilities that may have lead 
    to the development of these peoples. Currently the leading theory falls to 
    Raem Lairaun a young girl whose family traces roots to Haebrous descent. She 
    theorizes that at some future point we shall visit them again, and when we 
    do we shall have circumvented the principle of moments and traversed to a 
    period before their intelligence was heightened. She believes that we shall 
    spark their growth and open their potential to become the beings that they 
    are after our recent visit to their world. Theoretic Magic indeed, but a 
    forward thinking that may one day give rise to a new school of potent magic.
    <br>
    <br>
    Her opposition comes in the form of another much like herself, only Yaeve 
    Saedi hails from Yalain descent, and believes that this is an anomaly. 
    Something that is as the stricture of the Northern Church an accepted 
    universal constant that there are beings that are meant to watch others and 
    guide them through their lives. Hers is also a valid belief that has allowed 
    for much debate amongst the halls of Knorr as of late. <br>
    <br>
    I however have begun to dream a third possible scenario. Our race is seeped 
    in mystery and unknown. The furthest that we can trace our lineage is over 
    30,000 years prior to this, the Third Age of Lore. We are constantly 
    rediscovering ancient ruins of cultures that time has swallowed or swept 
    away... <br>
    <br>
    Perhaps my discovery of Planar travel was not a discovery. Perhaps it was a 
    reawakening of a magic that had long slumbered within the world waiting for 
    a time to be used again. If this is the case then who might have ventured to 
    Ezheret, perhaps to other worlds before we have done so? These answers I 
    hope to learn as we make future preparations. <br>
    <br>
    The next research trip will be lead by Delacim. I'll make sure to send both 
    Yaeve and Raem along, as they can both draw further and perhaps more 
    resolute conclusion by further exposure to the denizens of the world. Though 
    the focus will not be placed upon the Tonk but on the Banderlings, a race to 
    which we will not expose ourselves, I think that it will offer more insight 
    to all three theories.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">
