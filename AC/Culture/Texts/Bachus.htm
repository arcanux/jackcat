    <font color="#FFFF99">Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;Woe is me! The Hea must 
    have overheard that I have been sending travelers to investigate their 
    caverns, for they invaded my house, burned down my apple trees, and ate my 
    bunny rabbits!&nbsp; I barely escaped here to safety of Redspire in one piece! 
    Fortunately my dear friend Micon has agreed to give me shelter until I am 
    back upon my feet.&quot;<br>
    Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;They must hold that relic in high esteem indeed. 
    A most fanciful folk, I must say! I heard that it is a legendary spear that 
    they dismantled and enshrined in two separate caverns on the island. It once 
    belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to 
    persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. 
    Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to 
    have some sort of magical, &quot;living&quot; properties to it. I'm not quite sure 
    what to believe.&quot;<br>
    Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns 
    to the northwest along the shore.&nbsp; Try the area around 40.2N 84.7W --at 
    least that's where I saw the Tumeroks heading last. Beware, friend--it's 
    quite likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must catch up on my 
    journal today. If you would like to read it, here are a few pages that I 
    wrote the other day.&quot;</font><font color="#66FF99"><br>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Taiaha. A beautiful word. I think of farewells on a sandy beach, the sun 
    setting into a blue on blue horizon. &quot;Taiaha,&quot; they would say. &quot;Taiaha,&quot; I 
    would return, the last words spoken before night and sleep came upon us. <br>
    <br>
    But that is not what it means at all. In its native language, taiaha means 
    spear. A stick with a pointy end. It has had many different uses, I am sure. 
    Hunting, perhaps some fishing, if one is really good. It is one of a number 
    of tools that made our civilization possible. <br>
    <br>
    But really, at its essence, it is a tool of war. Used to kill people. A 
    thousand people on one end of a field, a thousand different people at the 
    other end. They shout at each other in excitement as they rush towards the 
    middle of the field to greet each other. But the pleasantries they exchange 
    are their taiahas, sticking them into each other as fast and hard as they 
    can. The point of the taiaha is transformation: to transform live beings 
    into dead bodies. Such a poor juxtaposition of word and meaning proves one 
    important point: that stupidity in a species is not limited to just us 
    humans. <br>
    <br>
    My new friends amongst the Tumeroks regale me with stories about their ways 
    and culture. They seem to take particular pride in pointing out the foibles 
    of their men, how easily led astray they are by their honor and pride. It is 
    an old story: men acting foolishly, and women taking care to highlight it. 
    Yet another way in which our two species are very similar. <br>
    <br>
    So here is a story of men and war, honor and pride, and a very unique 
    Taiaha. I heard it last night, from my Tumerok friends, and here I will 
    share it with you as it was told to me. <br>
    <br>
    ********** <br>
    <br>
    And when our people found themselves in this strange land with only two 
    moons, we had no Tonk Anixutah. So we soon fell to squabbles and discord, 
    and in the end, there were two xuta who contested to lead the Tonk. The Aun 
    were blinded by the far of this new land, and by the new beings who appeared 
    to show us our way. Atua Ngamaru, they called them, the floating demons. But 
    we, the Hea, saw in these beings the reason why we were brought to this 
    land, and we called them Atual Arutoa, the givers of freedom. <br>
    <br>
    And they were our gate to freedom, for our old forms and ways were unsuited 
    to this place, and to not change was to die. So we made our bargain with the 
    Atual Arutoa, and we became truly the Hea, separate and onto ourselves, and 
    we took over this new planet. <br>
    <br>
    The Aun, unable to match our strength or numbers, remained here on the 
    original island. Resentful of our abilities, they engaged in continual 
    sabotage of our plans and sought to destroy all that the Hea had wrought. 
    Time and time again, they sent emissaries and warriors, spies and thieves, 
    to try and stop us. When outright force failed, they turned to destruction 
    in the night. When terror failed, they turned to cunning words. When those 
    failed, they tried naked pleading. And when that failed, the cycle would 
    turn once again to violence and war. </font>
