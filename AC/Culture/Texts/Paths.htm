    Altas touched Syretta's cheek. This was the day of their parting, the first 
    leg of the separate journeys they had chosen to undertake. Two paths, one 
    destination, they would be together at the end if fortune was kind. A 
    parting kiss and they were off, he to the west, she to the east.<br>
    <br>
    On the second day of his journey Altas found himself thinking often of their 
    first meeting. It had been in Hebian-to. He had finished downing some ale at 
    the tavern and walked out the door. <br>
    <br>
    Perhaps it was the ale, perhaps it was fate, he found himself walking 
    towards the blacksmith shop across the square. Approaching the shop he saw 
    one customer standing at the window, a female in green mire armor. She 
    turned then and he marvelled at bright green eyes and blazing red hair that 
    seemed to light up the square. She smiled. He bowed, quite elegantly he 
    thought, rather clumsily she thought, yet in a charming way. They began 
    talking. Such was their first meeting.<br>
    <br>
    She had a strange dream the second night of her journey. She was walking 
    east along<span lang="en-us"> </span>a road when a bright red and blue bird 
    landed in front of her then flew off to her left, cawing madly as a crow 
    would. She turned towards it and found Altas was standing in front of her. 
    He beckoned to her, then stepped aside. Behind him was Aerlinthe Island. Not 
    any particular part of Aerlinthe Island, she just knew it was all of 
    Aerlinthe Island right in front of her. The island was covered with the red 
    and blue birds. The cawing noise was incessant.<br>
    <br>
    On the third afternoon of his journey he found himself surrounded by 
    banderlings, eight of them circling him. Turning to face north so to avoid 
    the sun's glare, he shifted his spear to his right hand and struck the one 
    before him, then struck the banderling to his right. Both banderlings fell, 
    providing him with two avenues of escape. The circle of banderlings broke 
    then, however, the creatures having lost their courage. They scattered in 
    all directions, leaving him safe to continue onwards.<br>
    <br>
    Having broken her sword upon the fang of an Ursuin who nevertheless met his 
    fate, Syretta was forced to deviate from her planned route and stop in 
    Eastham. After a repast at the tavern she went over to the blacksmith's 
    shop. Syretta opened the door, greeted Rundiscar the Weaponsmith and went to 
    Getram the Armorer who was standing in front of his forge. He laid out four 
    swords on the window facing the town square and another four on the opposite 
    window, offering that she examine each one. She tested the heft of each 
    weapon, the keenness of the blade. She examined several, did not find them 
    to her liking and moved to the other window. It was uncomfortably hot, the 
    heat of the forge seemed to be baking the entire left side of her body. 
    Syretta quickly examined one on<span lang="en-us"> </span>that window, then 
    moved further away from the blazing forge and picked up the second in that 
    row. The hilt of the sword fit her hand perfectly, the balance was superb. 
    The last two swords on display looked to be the wrong length. The one she 
    held should do nicely. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;I'll take this one, good sir,&quot; she said to the weaponsmith.<br>
    <br>
    Getram cheerfully accepted a stack of pyreals and bade her good day. Thus 
    equipped, she continued on her journey.<br>
    <br>
    On a southern-bound road he came across four men. One was from Fort Tethana, 
    one from Yaraq, one from Yanshi and another from Tou-tou. Three of these men 
    tried to deceive him, wishing him to part with his money. Various schemes 
    they tried, from wagers to tales of woe of kinfolk who were in dire need of 
    any pyreals he could spare. The fourth one, a sturdy individual from Fort 
    Tethana, he found to be honest and they became friends during this leg of 
    the journey.<br>
    <br>
    Syretta came upon a portal one day and chanced to enter it. Arriving in a 
    dank dungeon, she ventured down through its slime-covered passages. Half-way 
    down she was beset by mosswarts but handily defeated them with her new 
    sword. Continuing downwards, Syretta entered a larger chamber. Through the 
    torchlit gloom she could see one wall was carved with Empyrean runes. More 
    mosswarts lunged at her, but they fared no better than the ones above. 
    Syretta was curious about the runes, having studied for a time under a 
    scholar who had given her some understanding of Empyrean writing. Not 
    wanting to chance the appearance of more mosswarts than she might be able to 
    handle, Syretta copied the runes onto a few pages of parchment and departed 
    the dungeon. Finding a rock outcrop, she sat down on its moss-covered side 
    and began deciphering the runes. The runes on the stone described the four 
    seasons of the year, beginning with the cold of winter. The carver of these 
    runes had clearly preferred spring and summer. Winter and Fall had been 
    given a cursory, dismissive description. Spring and summer were lavishly 
    described, the flowering of trees and buzzing of bees given a good deal of 
    attention. Syretta generally preferred these two seasons herself and decided 
    she was in agreement with the ancient Empyrean who had carved the stone wall 
    down in that dungeon.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Altas decided he never wanted to see the desert again. The blowing sand had 
    been scraping away at his face and arms for three days now. One could escape 
    or fight raging monsters but there was no getting away from these incessant, 
    blinding particles. The flat plains regions may be a bit boring but he was 
    looking forward to them.<br>
    <br>
    The daylight was fading when Syretta finished studying the runes, the air 
    had grown chill. She stood and stretched. Shivering, she warmed her face in 
    the setting sun. Tomorrow would be the last leg of her journey but she could 
    get a bit of a start on it yet tonight.<br>
    <br>
    He met her finally at Lin, their meeting destination. She fell into his 
    arms, an embrace they both had missed. They recounted their individual tales 
    of travel and adventure. No longer would they journey separately. A few days 
    later, hand in hand, they headed for Nanto. They would see the Nanto Falls 
    together.</font></td>
