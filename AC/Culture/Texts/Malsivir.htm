	<font size="2" face="arial">Day 1: The Golem Arikas has shown only limited initiative or 
	intelligence, for all the power we can sense bound up in its body. We cannot 
	convince it to open up the restricted wings of Knorr, no matter how 
	effective our Eaters are in countering the Olthoi threat. Thankfully, 
	neither does it seem to object to our own activities within the Seat of 
	Knorr, most particularly in the conveyance chambers.<br>
	<br>
	Day 2: We have catalogued the destination of each of the intact conveyance 
	devices. We have even been able to apply some of Count Dardante's advanced 
	thaumaturgic theories to track down the destinations of some of the broken 
	devices. There is one device in particular which presents a tantalizing 
	challenge. Even were it whole, entry into that wing of the Collegium would 
	have proved difficult, because we have detected resonances of some of the 
	most powerful warding and concealment spells we have ever encountered.<br>
	<br>
	Day 3: After consultation with our Sovereign, we have begun detailed 
	investigations of the heavily warded conveyance device, which one of the 
	assistants has dubbed &quot;The Forbidden Portal.&quot; Count Dardante has paid a 
	personal visit to the research site, and his expertise has proven 
	invaluable. Through his own vigorous and inventive investigative methods, he 
	has determined that there are aftifacts of great interest to be found within 
	this closely guarded Collegium.<br>
	<br>
	Day 4: Count Dardante returned to the King's side early today, to examine 
	the artifacts and information that have been steadily flowing into the Royal 
	Archives. He has charged me to complete the breakthrough of the Forbidden 
	Portal and the exploration of the Collegium behind it. We have progressed 
	from investigation to active attempts to breach the protective wards. I have 
	already lost three assistants to the powerful defenses erected by the lord 
	of Knorr... who is still conspicuously absent.<br>
	<br>
	Day 5: It took the sacrifice of three more assistants, but we have 
	established a foothold in the newly opened Collegium Occultus. There is an 
	anteroom and another attendant Golem, which, like Arikas, seems to lack the 
	independent initiative to try and stop us itself. We are hard at work 
	breaking through the anteroom portal to the true Collegium compound. The 
	soldiers and scholars under my charge seem to have lost all fear of the 
	absent lord of the Collegia. It seems that there will be no reprisal from 
	the Empyrean founders of Knorr.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Day 6: As expected, we have defeated the last 
	wards protecting the Collegium Occultus. We have dispatched a horde of 
	Eaters and brutes to clear out the Olthoi that were within. Soon, the 
	Collegium will be ours. Even now I can sense the power of the magic held 
	within its stores...</font></p>
