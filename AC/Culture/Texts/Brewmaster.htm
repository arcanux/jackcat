	The brewing of beer is a subject quite dear to my heart. My father and his 
	father before him were renowned for their brewing abilities and were 
	frequently sought after by the rulers of Viamont, Aluvia, Gharu'n, and even 
	Milantos for their sweet brews. I learned my craft from them and have tried 
	to set down as best I can the knowledge with which they have so graciously 
	blessed me.There are four main ingredients in any good brew: barley, yeast, 
	hops, and water. The color or your barley controls the color of your brew. 
	Amber barley nets you an amber brew, dark barley gets you a nice stout, and 
	plain barley will give you a clear lager.<br>
	<br>
	Yeast is used to ferment your beer. The higher the quality of the yeast the 
	better. Dried yeast tends to get you a much higher quality brew than liqui<span lang="en-us">d</span> 
	yeast.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As for hops, the greener the better! Hops 
	provide that bitter taste that makes beer so deliciously delicious. But some 
	beers can be too bitter - bordering on undrinkable (though no beer is truly 
	undrinkable, truth be told). These beers are usually crafted from yellowish, 
	nasty hops. Discerning beer drinkers prize only those beers made from the 
	greenest of hops.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And the final ingredient - the one that ties 
	it all together - is water. Many people ignore the importance that water 
	play in the brewing process, but those of us who have spent our lives 
	mastering this life-giving liquid, we would have no beer at all!<br>
	<br>
	The basic process for brewing is simple: First you fill your Brew Kettle 
	with Water. Then you add Barley to create a Wort. once that is done, you add 
	Hops to finish your Wort. Once the Wort is finished, you add your Yeast. At 
	this point, you have a Fermented Brew.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, you can do one of two things with a 
	Fermented Brew. You can keg it or you can add an additive. Kegging a 
	Fermented Brew will get you a nice, tasty beer of which you can be very 
	proud. But the truly spectacular beers obtain their unique flavors from 
	those additives which set them apart from the rest of the pack. On Ispar, I 
	had any number of additives in my possession that allowed me to create those 
	beers which made my family so famous. So far, the harsh climate of these 
	wintry islands has not allowed me to find many additives worthy of the great 
	craft of brewing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I have many scouts searching through 
	all the wilds of Dereth at this very moment! I am certain they will soon 
	report back to me with a great many wonder<span lang="en-us">f</span>ul 
	additives that will allow me to create beers worthy of my father's name. 
	They are currently investigating the properties of the Tusker salivary 
	glands. I know that sounds fairly disgusting, but saliva from the wild apes 
	of Ispar allowed me to create some of my most famous beers!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now that you know the basics of brewing, 
	allow me to share a recipe with you to get you started. As you experiment 
	with different barleys, hops, yeasts, and - most importantly - additives, 
	you are sure to come up with many exciting brews of your own!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Homemade Amber Ale<br>
	- Use your Brew Kettle on Water.<br>
	- Use Amber Barley on your Full Brew Kettle to create an Amber Wort.<br>
	- Use Green Hops on your Amber Wort to create a Finished Amber Wort.<br>
	- Use Liquid Yeast on Finished Amber Wort to create an Amber Fermented Brew.<br>
	- Use an Empty Stopped Keg on your Amber Fermented Brew to create a Keg of 
	Homemade Amber Ale.<br>
	- Then just use a set of Empty Bottles on your keg and you're ready for a 
	nice, refreshing beverage!</font></p>
