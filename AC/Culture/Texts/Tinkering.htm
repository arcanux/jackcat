    When Asheron first came into the Consortium, I was amazed. He offered us 
    knowledge beyond everything we had begun to comprehend thus far and he 
    directed our attentions to some shortcomings. <br>
    <br>
    Bahb was less impressed but he was still shocked by the level of 
    enlightenment that Asheron offered us. As a result he and the few other 
    tinkerers beneath him have been working day and night in an effort to 
    perfect the &quot;Ust&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    A strange word, coming from the Yalaini language as explained to us by 
    Asheron. It means; that which reduces, or at least that is the closest 
    conversion in Roulean. <br>
    <br>
    I was asked to take a break from my work to assist in creating the processes 
    that would be used with the concentrated materials. As well I was asked to 
    pen this book, as an introduction to you, the populace, so that you could 
    more easily grasp the concepts of this great magic that we have unlocked.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Basics </b><br>
    <br>
    There are two aspects of tinkering, Salvaging and Application. <br>
    <br>
    Salvaging refers to the extraction of the base qualities of an item. <br>
    <br>
    Application refers to the infusion, or enhancement of an existing item by 
    way of adding the salvaged qualities of other items to the &quot;tinkered&quot; item. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Qualities </b> <br>
    <br>
    Every item that has ever been created attains qualities. These qualities are 
    determined by the craftsman who worked with them and the material that was 
    initially used to create the item. These qualities are explained as 
    Workmanship and Material Type. <br>
    <br>
    Workmanship refers to how well made the item is. The higher the workmanship 
    level the more potent the item is. <br>
    <br>
    Material Type refers to the material that was used to craft the object. 
    Typically these are metals, stones, cloths and gems. <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Ust and Salvaging </b><br>
    <br>
    The Ust is a mystical device that reduces items into their base qualities, 
    transforming them into a material. Each material type has a very specific 
    purpose, or application. <br>
    <br>
    The Ust can only be used to extract, or reduce, like propertied items. The 
    first item placed into the Ust determines the type of materials that are to 
    be extracted. For example, placing a wool shirt within the Ust would mean 
    that all other objects placed within would need to be made of wool in order 
    for the process to work. <br>
    <br>
    Once you have placed your items within the Ust you can extract the qualities 
    into a material. The material will be given a quantity, and an average 
    workmanship of the items reduced. Anyone can use an Ust as it is a mystical 
    device that harvests the qualities. However, if you have a stronger 
    rudimentary understanding of how materials work, whether through your 
    knowledge of armor, weaponry, or magical and normal item you will harvest 
    greater amounts of materials. No matter how proficiently skilled you are in 
    tinkering, the quality of the materials will be an average of the items 
    used. Example: If you place a perfectly crafted item with a poorly crafted 
    item you will most likely obtain a material of average quality. <br>
    <br>
    Another mystical quality of the Ust is the ability to determine the 
    difference between materials and items. When you place materials, the 
    reduced form of items, into the Ust with other materials, the quantity of 
    those items are added together, and a new average quality is obtained. The 
    most amazing thing about this process is that the Ust recognizes when there 
    are items mixed with materials. When instances such as this arise it will 
    obtain the quantity and average workmanship quality of the items and add 
    them to the existing materials. <br>
    <br>
    For example, if you place 12 bolts of average Wool with three Wool shirts of 
    perfect workmanship quality into the Ust, you will first collect the 
    quantity of wool from the shirts. Let's say16 bolts. The Ust will add the 16 
    bolts to the 12 bolts and determine the average workmanship quality of the 
    material based on the total amount of items used. <br>
    <br>
    Easy, right? <br>
    <br>
    Remember, anyone can salvage. Items that are reduced to materials can be 
    sold to shopkeepers at a greatly reduced cost, but they are also far lighter 
    than the items they are extracted from. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Application </b><br>
    <br>
    Salvaged materials can be applied to items. Each material will alter a very 
    specific area of the item you wish to tinker with. Wool <br>
    <br>
    for example is an excellent source of insulation from the cold. It's no 
    surprise then that it will affect the level of cold protection that armor 
    offers. <br>
    <br>
    Applying materials can only be attempted by a skilled tinkerer. That means 
    that you must be trained in armor, weapon, item or magic item tinkering in 
    order to manipulate items with materials. <br>
    <br>
    Armor tinkerers work with armor, weapon tinkerers work with weapons, magic 
    items work with qualities of a powerful and mystical nature, at the moment 
    we are still <br>
    <br>
    working on direct applications, and item tinkerers work with the generic 
    applications such as weight, and value of objects. Again without training in 
    one of these areas, it will not be possible for a person to apply materials.
    <br>
    <br>
    Materials can only be added to items when you have 100 pieces of a single 
    material type. For example, if you wished to increase the cold protection of 
    a piece of armor, you would need 100 bolts of Wool and be an armor tinkerer 
    to attempt the adjustment. Then based upon several factors you would either 
    succeed or fail in the application. <br>
    <br>
    Success will modify the protection to be better, whereas failure would 
    result in both the material and the item being destroyed. <br>
    <br>
    It is not easy to tinker with crafted items, but there are some things that 
    will make the process go more smoothly. <br>
    <br>
    First obtain the highest average workmanship materials that you can. The 
    better the workmanship of your materials, the easier they are to work and 
    adapt. <br>
    <br>
    Second, lesser quality workmanship items are easier to improve as they were 
    not that well crafted to begin with. The more close to perfect an item is 
    the harder it will be to improve. <br>
    <br>
    Third, don't overdo it. The more you tinker an object the more difficult it 
    will become to make it better. So the easier it will become to ruin the 
    object. <br>
    <br>
    Lastly, but most importantly; practice. You will get better if you practice 
    your trade. The more often you work at the better you'll become.
