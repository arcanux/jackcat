      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I had never been prone to nightmares 
      growing up. This fine house, this kingly mansion was a dream come true, 
      the paragon of residences. A reward for my services to the Arcanum. But 
      several nights after moving into this large house I began to have bad 
      dreams. At first nothing defined, just dreams of wandering this cavernous 
      mansion, searching, searching. Never finding whatever it was I was seeking 
      and waking up with a hollow feeling in my gut. <br>
      <br>
      As events unfolded into a patchwork of horror, I decided to begin keeping 
      a journal of these events.<br>
      <br>
      In the darkness of night I would sense just how big this house is. Such a 
      huge quantity of finely crafted wood and stone constructed to enclose so 
      much empty space. Most of this large structure hollow, I the only living 
      thing within it. Sometimes, I would hear wind blowing through some distant 
      rooms although I was certain all windows were intact. Investigating, I 
      would find the windows in place and the sound gone.<br>
      <br>
      A few days after moving in I went down to the mansion dungeon to get my 
      jeweled longsword that I had placed on a wall hook. I wished to wear it at 
      a social event hosted by Madame Nevar. It hung right where I had put it 
      but the blade was bent and twisted as if it had been mangled by something 
      filled with malevolence and brimming with power. I thought it some sort of 
      clever prank, perhaps committed by a mage friend of mine and, though 
      annoyed, dismissed it.<br>
      <br>
      One night I was sleeping soundly only to be awakened by loud noises from 
      downstairs. It sounded like a crowd of people murmuring, speaking, all in 
      a patois whose origin I could only guess.<br>
      <br>
      I crept down the stairs expecting I knew not what, yet somehow to be 
      anticipating the
      worst. The mad jabbering grew louder as I got closer to the Great Hall. As 
      I threw open the door the cacophony turned into a hiss...and was gone. The 
      Hall was empty; the throne-like chair in the center its only occupant. Had 
      it just been host to some spectral gathering?<br>
      <br>
      The next evening while walking through a room I sensed something wrong. 
      The night was warm, yet this part of the room felt cold. Shivering, my 
      skin felt as if it had been brushed by cold fingers.<br>
      <br>
      I stopped, looking around, as I had noticed a movement out of the corner 
      of my eye. I was standing by a painting, that of a scribe studying 
      scrolls. I turned to look at the picture, but could see nothing unusual 
      about it. I drew closer since I was sure I had seen something- the human 
      eye is marvelous at detecting motion. I saw nothing for a moment. <br>
      <br>
      Then the scribe's head in the painting turned slowly towards me! I looked 
      into his eyes, which appeared to be turning red... Suddenly the face 
      transformed into something hideous, the eyes falling back into his skull, 
      leaving open, gaping pits. It was a gaunt visage of something that may 
      have been a man once but had died a long time ago in agony and was still 
      screaming. I stumbled back from the picture, tripping over a chair. 
      Falling backwards, it seemed the horror was now leaping out of the 
      painting, reaching for me with withered fingers, the flesh hanging off the 
      bones. I rolled over, trying to get back on my feet, sheer panic flowing 
      through me. Jumping up, I whirled round to face the creature but there was 
      nothing there. <br>
      <br>
      The painting hung peacefully, the scribe placidly studying the scrolls. 
      Taking a deep breath, I backed away, my heart pounding in my chest. Had I 
      imagined it? Perhaps it was a product of a bit of undercooked reedshark 
      steak in my belly?<br>
      <br>
      I was down in the dungeon the next day and near the storage chests when I 
      heard a cry such as I would not imagine could be uttered from man or 
      beast. Full of anguish, as if talons were ripping the insides of some 
      forlorn, dire beast. The cry echoed off the finely frescoed walls. I 
      ripped a dagger off<span lang="en-us"> </span>its wall hook and, blade in hand, I searched every inch 
      of the dungeon only to find nothing amiss.<br>
      <br>
      The next day when I went down there I noticed that a particular spot in 
      one of the northwest room was much colder than the rest of the structure. 
      I could see no water leaks, no openings of any kind and had there been any 
      openings certainly no air could be circulating so deep underground. I went 
      down there that afternoon to check on matters again and saw a fine drudge 
      mask I had had crafted for me to wear at festivals was lying on the floor. 
      It had apparently fallen off its hook. <br>
      <br>
      As I picked it up I noticed once more that it was quite cold in that spot, 
      yet when I touched the wall it felt to be the same temperature as the 
      other walls. Shrugging, I hung the mask back up and turned away. As I was 
      stepping out of the room I heard a thud behind me. Startled, I whirled 
      around to see the drudge mask had fallen again. I replaced it and waited 
      but it stayed on the wall. The cold air in its location seemed to have 
      dissipated.<br>
      <br>
      At night I began to dream of tunnels deep within the ground, writhing with 
      moldering bodies of creatures that should be quite dead, yet are not. 
      Creatures with innards that have turned into a foul putrescence, they claw 
      towards the surface, tearing open the grassy skin of the earth from within 
      like maggots emerging from a rotting apple. They come boiling out of the 
      ground, wielding sharp weapons, searching for prey with rotting, blind eye 
      sockets.<br>
      <br>
      One night during such a nightmare I awoke to see one of the horrors 
      standing by the foot of my bed! A putrid, tattered thing, an upright 
      corpse, the flesh flayed from its bones. I leaped up but the grim visage 
      disappeared. I lit the candle and examined the spot where it stood. There 
      was nothing there and I would have attributed it as part of my dream had I 
      not detected a foul stench that hung in the air in that very spot. Sleep 
      would not come again to me that night or the next. <br>
      <br>
      Sleepless, I wandered the halls of my mammoth dwelling expecting the worst 
      around every corner.<br>
      <br>
      With trepidation I descended to the mansion dungeon. I saw nothing amiss 
      and went once more to the northwest room where my drudge mask had done its 
      suspicious jumping trick. It hung there on the wall, yet for a moment as I 
      entered I thought I saw it grinning at me. An artifact of a sleep-deprived 
      mind no doubt, for as I drew near I saw it to be its normal holiday-mask 
      self. Standing there, however, I heard a noise by that wall, a sound that 
      seemed just at the threshold of audibility so that I could not be certain 
      of its true existence. A scratching sound, like that of broken fingernails 
      tearing at earth and rock, as of a corpse patiently endeavoring to dig 
      itself out of a grave. I touched the wall to discover whether any 
      vibration accompanied that fearful sound.<br>
      <br>
      For a moment nothing, then I felt a cold gust, like the breath of 
      something dark and dead. I hurried back upstairs, looking behind me every 
      few paces, the emptiness of the dungeon mocking my retreat.<br>
      <br>
      Not wanting to go down to the dungeon any more, I placed some chests 
      upstairs in the mansion and began keeping my closer personal articles 
      there including my valued emerald, the antique platter my aunt gave me and 
      my favorite puffy shirt. I decided to keep the door to the dungeon portal 
      room locked for fear of something coming up through it.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, I am aware now that no physical lock could keep the horrors at 
      bay.<span lang="en-us"> </span>The next night I finally fell into a fitful 
      sleep. I dreamt I was falling through a black vastness towards an even 
      blacker one, a void of hunger and rage. Feeling this dream all too real, I 
      struggled to wake up. With an effort, I opened my eyes, the rushing 
      blackness giving way to an appalling reality. The corpse stood there again 
      at the foot of my bed. It opened its rotting jaw wider than any normal 
      human possibly could, emitting a horrible scream, which would not stop. I 
      leapt out of bed and down the stairs, seeing the house go mad about me. 
      Furniture, once benign, now had taken on dreadful countenance. Moldering 
      corpses hung from the beams. All the candles and torches were gone; the 
      rooms dark and dire except where phantomlike lights glowed. Dead, spectral 
      things wandered the corridors. The very walls reached for me with skeletal 
      claws. The screaming went on and on, it would not end.<br>
      <br>
      I later realized the screaming came from me as well.<br>
      <br>
      I raced out of that fearful, monstrous structure as one might run from the 
      jaws of a raging Shreth. I stopped near the bottom of the hill to catch my 
      breath, turning to assure myself nothing foul was in pursuit of me. 
      Several of the windows of the mansion were blazing with a cold, evil 
      light. In one window there stood a figure looking out at me, the decaying 
      thing from my bedroom. It was grinning at me. An inhuman grin of triumph 
      and utter madness.<br>
      <br>
      I have not ventured back into the mansion since. I would prefer to freeze 
      out here in the wind and rain than face the unknown<span lang="en-us">
      </span>horrors of that haunted place. There may be no one brave enough in 
      this land to do so. Who can help me?<br>
      <br>
      Who would'st I call?</font></p>
