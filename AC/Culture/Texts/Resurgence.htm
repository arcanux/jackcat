    The Olthoi they have struck terror into my heart ever since my first steps 
    on the blasted landscapes of their home world. In that first excursion I 
    lost much. <br>
    <br>
    Upon my second visit, I was given insight into a vast culture that was 
    gifted with an incredible intelligence and understanding of tactics. The 
    swarm there was bolstered and guided by their Queen. As though she was the 
    facilitator and coordinator of all their efforts.<br>
    <br>
    During a battle with what appeared to be the Olthoi's only natural enemy, 
    what some here refer to as Grievvers, I was able to construct a mystical 
    structure to allow us to bear witness to the battle. We watched a fantastic 
    massacre and were able to obtain an Olthoi specimen for study. As we made 
    our way out of my shelter a great rumbling began deep beneath the soil. I 
    instructed the expedition to retreat to the portal with the specimen, while 
    I remained behind to examine this new threat. As the research expedition 
    disappeared into the grayish-yellow mist that was the air on that world I 
    was met with a most terrible sight, an Olthoi Queen.<br>
    <br>
    Her armies, tired and beaten by the savagery of their assailants, lined up 
    beside her and in front of her as she issued a complex sequence of hisses, 
    chitters and clicks. I began my retreat slowly until she released the horde 
    upon me. Flying beasts dropped from the sky in an effort to grasp my robes 
    and hoist me into the air, but the magic of my armor was too strong for them 
    to pierce. Then without warning, all of my defensive spells disappeared and 
    I was left to my weakest magic. I ran...I was not able to continue to hold 
    off their assault and so I resigned myself to seeing that the iris of my 
    portal was closed so that they could not make their way through.<br>
    <br>
    The queen pursued, carried aloft by a host of her flying beasts. As they 
    lowered her to the ground they fell from the air exhausted, perhaps dying. 
    The portal back to Auberean was closed; I needed only to use one of the gems 
    that myself and a few others carried for emergencies, but I feared that 
    whatever it was that was draining my access to the higher magics would 
    render the gem impotent.<br>
    <br>
    I called upon my knowledge and reached within the dying mana streams of that 
    world and I fought her. <br>
    <br>
    I was able to open a hole in her carapace utilizing the most base of the 
    heiromantic spells in my arsenal, but I did not kill her - I merely stunned 
    her. While she reeled, her horde became confused and reverted to the the 
    collection of food and fighting amongst themselves. I felt the magic return 
    to me and used the gem to return home. <br>
    <br>
    Against my advice, the Emperor sanctioned return expeditions to obtain as 
    many specimens as Gaerlan could. I opened each portal and closed them upon 
    their return. In all, over twenty variations were collected and many more 
    catalogued before they captured the Queen.<br>
    <br>
    When Gaerlan made his way back to my school with the Queen specimen, it 
    became apparent that he had captured the same Queen I had fought. She was 
    injured, suffering from wounds inflicted by our warriors and at her breast 
    was a deep crack from the assault I levied against her years before.<br>
    <br>
    When she came into Knorr she was incoherent, nearly insensate but I saw 
    something that drove a deeper fear into my being: recognition. She knew me. 
    I could tell by the way that her eyes fixated upon me and held there gaze 
    until I left her presence. The way they bore into me like flame.<br>
    <br>
    The impact of her arrival was felt immediately. Other olthoi specimens began 
    to act out aggressively in their pens. Research was suspended as we 
    attempted to regain control over the lesser Olthoi. <br>
    <br>
    We learned very quickly that the Queen was breeding. She was developing an 
    egg sac upon her arrival and though she was injured it did not slow the 
    progress.<br>
    <br>
    She was weakened and had no forces with which to rout us, and then the 
    disaster struck. A portal had remained open from their world to this, one 
    that we had not known about. Olthoi species began pouring through and as 
    they came into proximity of their hive mind and leader they...<br>
    <br>
    ...you know the rest. My society entered a war against the Olthoi that 
    lasted for over one hundred years, and in the end, we lost. I took every 
    precaution to end their invasion but they bred so quickly, and with the 
    birth of new Queens we fought several hives at once. They did not make war 
    on one another as was speculated about their home world. They were all of 
    the same brood, irrevocably tied to their one Queen.<br>
    <br>
    After all of those years of fighting we made our way to Ireth Lassel as a 
    last effort to sequester and save our race. But not before a massive loss of 
    life to acquire formulae from my father's research.<br>
    <br>
    During the war we had obtained one queen, mature and developed. With the 
    assistance of five of the most potent practitioners of Acumen Manim we were 
    able to render her insensate. We used her as a research specimen in 
    conjunction with my father's works hoping to create a venom that would be 
    used against them. But the Queen had already dispatched flyers to Ireth 
    Lassel carrying a single egg that would grow into another Queen. Our efforts 
    to discover the location of the burgeoning hive failed, and the safety of my 
    people took precedence over the research. After our years of failing to find 
    this Queen I, with a heavy heart, cast the spell that sent my race into the 
    flux of portal space, where they do not age, and are kept alive through a 
    means that I still do not completely understand. Then I concealed my 
    whereabouts through the most potent use of illusion that had ever been 
    enacted and began my research anew. After nearly five hundred years I had 
    found my answer. But I had only enough venom for one use.<br>
    <br>
    I left my lonely tower to find the Queen that ruled all the world and was 
    met instead by the Virindi. Our conflict was short, for all their current 
    potency they were still lesser beings learning to adapt to a strange world. 
    Yet they were able to harm me and when that conflict was done, I was drained 
    of much energy and so returned to my tower, knowing that I would require all 
    my strength if I were to defeat the Queen.<br>
    <br>
    But my conflict with the Virindi had greater repercussions. My portal 
    network was reactivated through some nefarious means, and as a result 
    portals opened on all worlds to which we Empyrean had traveled. This caused 
    an influx of creatures to the world, an occurrence I was unaware of until...<br>
    <br>
    Some years later your people arrived, and as I made my way from my tower 
    back to Ireth Lassel I was in awe. I was horrified that the portal network I 
    had established had gone so terribly awry. All manner of creatures, from 
    worlds that I had visited with my students, roamed across the land.<br>
    <br>
    Most, with rudimentary intelligence, were enslaved, stirring the vats that 
    the Olthoi used to assist in the growth of their fungal blooms. Others 
    remained free, establishing minor outposts and occupying the great halls of 
    my people. <br>
    <br>
    The Aluvians, the Isparian with whom we Empyrean had the most contact, were 
    enslaved. When Thorsten and Elysa made their way to my island, I made the 
    decision to follow my heart. This land was concealed. The Queen here needed 
    to be destroyed so that the people who had been brought here could live 
    their lives.<br>
    <br>
    I gave the phial over to Elysa and strengthened the spell that surrounds 
    these lands. The Olthoi could not pierce the veil over this island... or so 
    I had thought. But now, as it was when the Queen of the Olthoi first 
    asserted herself over the hordes that poured through the portals from their 
    world to this, I am stricken with an illness that drives the mana from me, 
    making the access of higher magics impossible. The Olthoi have bred another 
    variant of their leeches. <br>
    <br>
    I have erected a shield about my tower to ward it against the Olthoi 
    presence but there is little that I can do beyond this. I must open portals 
    to the mainland in hopes that some will come to my aid. Then we must band 
    together and prepare for this menace. For if she is returned and alive then 
    I fear only the worst.<br>
    <br>
    I fear that she has always been searching for me. The numbers that have 
    poured forth from the ground lead me to believe that there is a horde 
    greater than the horde that first swarmed over Knorr and cast the civilized 
    world of the Yalain aside. I fear that she leads them with a singular 
    purpose, that of revenge. But I do not think that she will stop with me. <br>
    <br>
    If she is allowed to breed on Ireth Lassel then everything that I have 
    worked for and all that I have done in this life has been for naught. <br>
