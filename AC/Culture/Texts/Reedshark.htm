    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelen Seln's journey had started well. He had 
    met his friend Symone Paik near what was once Arwic. She recounted the tale 
    of the city's final days to him as they headed toward the shortcut through 
    the mountains. They sprinted most of the way as the creatures they 
    encountered would have easily cleaved them in twain. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They came to rest at the bottom of a small 
    hill and looked up to see a singular guardian barring the way to the Vesayen 
    Isles. They would need to run by it to access this final portal, but that 
    would prove a simple task. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What are we going to hunt on these islands?” 
    Kelen asked as Symone made ready to cast a protective spell upon them.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'll tell you when we get there,” she 
    smirked at him. “You're not afraid, are you?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'm not afraid, just prudent. I don't like 
    running off willy-nilly into the seat of danger. It's not fear. . . it's 
    caution. . . I am not in the habit of throwing that to the wind.” He had 
    spoken too long. She was preparing for the journey, infusing her robe with 
    protective magic before focusing the unseen tendrils of mana around herself. 
    He grumbled and pulled his shield tightly onto his arm and withdrew his 
    mace. “You'll be the death of me.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She chuckled between casting her spells and 
    turned her attention toward him. Placing the protective magic of the heart 
    around him like a blanket against the cold. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ready?” she asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No. . . but let's do this anyway.” He forced 
    a smile to his lips and took off running for the portal. The guardian, a 
    singular Olthoi, swiped at them but the protective magic protected them 
    against the assault. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“That wasn't so bad, was it?” She smiled, 
    breathing a little heavy from the run. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No worse than running into a pack Reedsharks.” 
    He chuckled softly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Kelen had just arrived in Nanto when he met Symone. They discussed their 
    experiences and adventured together, becoming fast friends. They had many 
    victories in each other's company, and often faced defeat as well. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One day, early in their friendship, the two 
    set out to journey along the countryside. They faced a host of creatures 
    that proved to be of little challenge to them. Bolstered, they ventured 
    further into the dark woods of the Sho wilderness. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a few moments they saw what appeared to 
    be a small creature in the distance. It stood on three legs, no higher than 
    their knees. Symone cast protections on them and they ran toward the 
    creature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Its hide was leathery, almost scaled, covered 
    in a patchwork of mottled red and brown. A single fin rose off its back, 
    slight, but obvious. It was tailless, and the three legs ended in vile, 
    sharp-clawed paws. The only feature more terrifying was its maw. Three rows 
    of needle teeth spread wide across its head. Above its mouth two observant 
    eyes scanned the horizon and focused on Kelen and Symone. The creature 
    reared onto its hind leg and howled. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelen swung his mace and thumped into the 
    hide of the small Reedshark. It whimpered like a small child as a wound 
    opened and spilled deep red blood onto the ground. Symone unleashed a hail 
    of whirling blades against the critter and it wheeled, refocusing on her. 
    Kelen pursued, striking the beast with quick, accurate blows. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the creature fell under the onslaught from 
    the pair, they heard the unmistakable sound of growls closing in around 
    them. They closed ranks and positioned themselves back to back. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What are they?” Kelen asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I think they're its parents.” Symone 
    replied, and swallowed hard. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Around them, silver-gray and rust-brown hides 
    shifted side to side. Deep rumbling growls coursed through their bodies and 
    echoed off the trees. Deep gouges marked some of the silver Reedsharks, 
    testament to the many battles they had seen. Their maws dripped a foul ichor 
    and housed rows of dagger-sharp teeth. The brown sharks stood as support to 
    the warriors, their hides were thick but lacked the scarring of the older 
    stronger ones. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the head, a singular white-silver 
    Reedshark stood. Taller than the others, its flesh was scored with deep 
    gouges and its eyes contained hatred and anger unmatched. It issued a howl 
    that sent shivers down Kelen and Symone's spines. Slowly the fin on its back 
    rose, and the blood-red mark on the crest of the fin became visible. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We're in trouble.” Symone quaked with fear.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelen swallowed as the fins on the Reedsharks 
    rose as one and the world spun into the place between life and death. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    “C'mon, you lummox.” She smiled, and began removing heavier layers of 
    clothing. The tropical Vesayen Isles were much different than the mountains 
    of Northern Osteth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Why are we here again?” He asked as he 
    packed away his winter wraps. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'm told that there are good creatures to 
    hunt here, but we've got to watch out for. . . Reedsharks.” She chuckled.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You're kidding.” He stopped packing and 
    stared at her his mouth agape. She shook her head. “You're not kidding. But 
    we didn't survive our last encounter with a pack of those things.” </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We'll be fine, Kelen. We've both grown in 
    ability since then.” She smiled. “C'mon.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Famous last words. . .” he mumbled. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">They set off along the beach and fought 
    Armoredillo that trolled the shore for fish wandering too close to the 
    shore. The jungle about them teemed with the sounds of drums and the mass of 
    life within. Large stone structures, carved in the shape of Mosswarts, lined 
    the beach and edges of the jungle. They evaded the poor-sighted creatures by 
    staying close to the shore, sometimes skulking through the water. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“See, nothing to this,” Symone stated firmly. 
    A mana field broke around her, and she cursed. “I need to recast our 
    protections, hold here a moment.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelen warily scanned the shore and beach. A 
    band of Mosswarts crept closer. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No time--Mosswarts!” he bellowed. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the water behind them a singular fin rose. 
    Kelen took one step forward as Symone summoned protective forces about him. 
    The Mosswarts cast the antithesis spells of the heart, voiding her efforts. 
    As Kelen charged headlong toward the band he bellowed furiously. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Mosswarts broke as he hit hard sand. They 
    scattered, tossing aside spears and croaking madly as they ran into the 
    jungle. Kelen slowed his pace and watched, curiously, as they retreated from 
    him. A sense of pride swept over him and he turned back toward Symone with 
    an immense grin etched on his face. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Obviously they've heard of--” Kelen choked 
    on the words. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Over Symone's fresh corpse, half covered in 
    the surf, a green-skinned Reedshark stood triumphant. Red gore surrounded 
    its mouth and it barked out to others whose fins were cutting through the 
    surf. Kelen swallowed hard and stifled tears. Though dying did not mean the 
    end here on Dereth it was painful and something one did not forget. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Reedsharks reared and howled. An instant 
    later they closed on him and bit through chainmail, tearing flesh and limbs 
    free from his body. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    “We'll be fine, Kelen. . .” He mocked at the Lifestone. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I thought we would have been.” She responded 
    with a dismal tone in her voice. “What did you lose?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“My breastplate, a ring, and an orb. . . 
    you?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Nothing of consequence. Are we going back 
    for your breastplate?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He shook his head as a form coalesced. A man, 
    shirtless, cursed aloud as he came into being. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What got you?” Kelen asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Dune Reaver.” The man replied. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What's that?” Symone arched a brow as she 
    asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Reedshark from the desert.” The man said.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Kelen and Symone looked at one another and 
    laughed.<br>

			claw and fang. They can be found nearly anywhere, except for
