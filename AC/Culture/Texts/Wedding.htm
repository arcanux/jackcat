    All weddings are special events of great personal importance. They call for a deep and
    lasting commitment between two people, and should not be entered into lightly. That said,
    the joys and happiness of marriage await!<br>
    <br>
    Here in Dereth, representatives of the heritage groups have agreed upon a common ceremony,
    which is presented herein. The Officiator will provide the wedding rings, emblems of
    marriage, and the celebratory gems. Misuse of the items is strongly frowned upon.<br>
    <br>
    It is suggested that all participants read this book thoroughly and have their spoken
    material prepared beforehand.<br>
    <br>
    ARRANGEMENTS<br>
    To schedule a wedding, bride and groom must set a location (complete with map
    coordinates), time and date, and all other relevant information.<br>
    <br>
    Once this is done, one must go to the top level, main Asheron's Call Zone page. Enter News
    and Events. From there, choose to Submit an Event.<br>
    <br>
    Once there, read the guidelines and then fill in the form. Keep in mind that Sentinels who
    set up the wedding may be unavailable at the requested time.<br>
    <br>
    THE BEGINNING<br>
    Before the ceremony, the Officiator provides the participants the rings, emblems, and
    gems, and gives them time to examine and inscribe them.<br>
    <br>
    It is customary to have the Officiator stand behind the participants, who face each other.
    Guests then stand or sit in a semi-circle around them, at a respectful distance. Guests
    may be asked to make short speeches before the ceremony begins.<br>
    <br>
    Officiator: Welcome, friends and family of &lt;bride&gt; and &lt;groom&gt;! Let us begin.<br>
    <br>
    OF FREE WILL<br>
    Officiator: &lt;bride&gt;, are you here of your own free will?<br>
    <br>
    Bride: Yes<br>
    <br>
    Officiator: &lt;groom&gt;, are you here of your own free will?<br>
    <br>
    Groom: Yes<br>
    <br>
    Officiator: Are there any here who have legitimate cause to oppose this marriage?<br>
    <br>

    <br>

    <br>
    Officiator: Do you pledge to love, cherish, and honor him, through all your time in
    Dereth?<br>
    <br>

    <br>

    friend, through all trials and tribulations, joys and victories?<br>

    <br>

    Officiator: &lt;bride&gt;, please share with us your loving intentions toward
    &lt;groom&gt;.<br>
    <br>
    Bride: [Speak about how you will love and cherish the groom. It helps to have this
    prepared beforehand.]<br>
    <br>
    Officiator: &lt;groom&gt;, please share with use [sic] your loving intentions toward
    &lt;bride&gt;.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Officiator: Before the witnesses of your friends and family, you are now pronounced
    husband and wife. May your marriage bring you great happiness.<br>
    <br>
    [Guests may now congratulate the married couple. Emote freely. Save celebratory gems for
    use outside.]<br>

    <p><i><font size="2">April 28, 2000</font></i><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">In the spirit of this season of hearts and flowers, the 
    faithful Sentinels of Dereth are conducting Wedding Ceremonies for all 
    willing lovebirds. As our new society on the edge of chaos matures, so grows 
    the desire to express devotion that goes even deeper than a fellowship or 
    allegiance. Though this ceremony has only the powers and benefits that the 
    betrothed bring to it, a wedding union symbolizes a bond that endures the 
    many trials of life in Dereth. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Sentinels conduct Private Wedding ceremonies upon request. 
    To request a Sentinel, you must sign up online. If the request can be 
    honored, a Sentinel will marry the betrothed in a location of their choice. 
    Read on to learn how to request a private ceremony. <b>All requests MUST be 
    made 2 weeks prior to the Wedding Date.</b> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">On the Zone's AC pages, click <b>News &amp; Events </b>in the 
    Table of Contents, then the <b>Events </b>heading. At the Events page:
    </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">Click <b>Submit an Event</b>. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Read the guidelines. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Fill in your character name. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">No Web URL is necessary, though you can supply one if 
      you wish. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">For the title, say, &quot;Private Wedding of &lt;names&gt;,&quot; as 
      appropriate. Fill in the names of those to be wed. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">In the description for a Private Wedding request, please 
    supply the following: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">In the Description field, mention the character names 
      of the people to be wed and any other information you would like to 
      include. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">For the Location field, accurately describe the 
      location. Give both the landmark (such as &quot;the hill above the Shoushi 
      Grotto&quot;) and the map coordinates (&quot;36.3 S, 16.1 E&quot;). Keep in mind that we 
      cannot honor requests for ceremonies in naturally crowded areas such as 
      towns or popular dungeons/battlegrounds. Nobody will be protected from 
      Portal Storms! </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">The world where the characters reside. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">The Starting and Ending date and times. The date must 
      be at least two weeks after the date that the request is made. Note that 
      without both spouses-to-be present, the Sentinel will not wait around for 
      long after the starting time! </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Recurrence should be 1 Time Only. </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">The betrothed will be provided with a pair of wedding 
    bands to exchange as a token of their commitment to one another. Any number 
    of guests can be invited to a Private Wedding; doing so is up to the 
    betrothed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Aside from the following disclaimers, that is it. We hope 
    you enjoy the weddings! </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">Requests for Private Weddings are not guaranteed to be 
      honored; the scheduling depends on the availability and volunteered effort 
      of a Sentinel. The AC Events Coordinator will accommodate requests on a 
      first-made, first-served basis. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Unless you specifically request the wedding to be 
      unpublished, Private Weddings will be put on the Events Calendar, 
      displaying the information you provided. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">Note that Player Killers will, as always, NOT be 
      protected by the attending Sentinel. If bloodshed makes the ceremony too 
      chaotic, the Sentinel reserves the right to end the ceremony. </font></li>
      <li><font size="2">This is a &quot;common law&quot; type of marriage. It has no 
      special powers or considerations, and the bond may be broken or redefined 
      by the wedded participants. </font></li>
