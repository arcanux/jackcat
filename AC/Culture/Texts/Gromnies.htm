      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even at the best of times, the two Aluvian
      hunters did not enjoy one another's company. After spending the night
      isolated deep within the Stonehold Valley, bandaging wounds gained on
      their journey thus far, the hunters awoke even less inclined to get along.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Cuthbert, Knight of the Golden Flame,
      arose first and well before dawn. Quietly rolling together his bedroll,
      the knight prepared to sneak down the stairs of the abandoned tower, all
      too happy to be parting ways.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Or so he'd hoped.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before taking the first step past the
      chamber's archway, the voice of his traveling companion came grumbling
      from behind. “Not thinking of taking a rogue's leave, now, are you?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Archibald, Knight of the Crooked Arrow,
      had rolled over to face him, propped up on one elbow. “They say,”
      Archibald yawned, “I've ears sharp as a Virindi's sickle. . . . And
      you'll find yourself hard pressed today without your precious hematite
      ring.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cuthbert glanced at his hand. His bare
      hand. How the knave managed to slip the ring from his finger, he'd no
      idea.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Archibald examined the jeweled item in one
      calloused palm. “They also say,” he went on, a slight sneer in his
      sleepy voice, “I've fingers quick as a Phyntos Wasp's wings.”</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Within Dereth's menagerie of creatures,
      few have proven of any use as livestock. Attempts to put captured Drudges
      and Banderlings to labor have met with almost no success; the prisoners
      proved unable to comprehend any instructions. Most experiments with Reed
      Shark watchdogs resulted in total disaster. The Lugian people seem to have
      mastered the taming of these beasts, but it remains beyond our ken. (I
      have heard rumors that a powerful Aluvian life mage has achieved the same
      success as the Lugians, but I cannot personally confirm this.) And while
      some Holtsburgian farmers have yoked Auroch bulls, they admit the beasts
      are of far better value when slaughtered and ground into mince.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">There appears to be precious little use
      for Derethian fauna except in death, when expert craftsmen can rework bits
      of the corpses into useable items. Consider the Armoredillo's useful
      plates, or the furry hide of the Mattekar. And while Drudges and their kin
      have proven no use for labor, their heads, at least, have made fine
      harvest festival masks. It is a terrible truth that we of the Exploration
      Society, and our colleagues in the Environmental Defense League, have been
      unable to find a practical reason to encourage the sparing of our more
      wild companions.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet there remains the enigma of the
      Gromnie.</font></i>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="Head"><b>-- Lady Aiyou-Shih
      Tan, Dereth Exploration Society&nbsp;<br>
      (from the essay, “Dereth: Crucible of Life”)</b></span><br>
      <br>
      Archibald and Cuthbert originally met in distant Cragstone, where they
      shared a mutual craftsman contact; the odds of their meeting proved as
      inevitable as its unpleasantness. The two engaged in identical business:
      hunting Dereth's creatures for their hides. It didn't help that their
      respective knightly orders differed greatly on philosophical points,
      occasionally debating such issues upon the field of battle.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For once, however, the two had chosen to
      enter into a mutual, if reluctant, partnership. A well known duke, though
      neither knight's monarch, had been offering exorbitant prices for Ivory
      Gromnie hides. Better for the professionals to collect this price, they
      both felt, rather than the common rabble.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Walking along the rolling hills, the
      knights kept their eyes to either side. They'd learned to check for such
      random encounters as had laid them up last night in the tower.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Other trophy collectors seek the wings
      of the Phyntos, or scalps from savage Drudge Raveners. I wonder why our
      esteemed duke looks to the weaker Ivory Gromnies?” Cuthbert asked.
      “And will you kindly return my ring? For chivalry's sake, at least?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I feel compelled to keep the ring as
      token hostage. . . to ensure our continued partnership, you understand. As
      for the duke, I'm surprised you haven't heard. They say he's reached such
      power, the intrinsic value of items means less to him now than the
      aesthetic. He seeks a complete suit of ivory leather, crafted from the
      Gromnies' hides.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two did not agree on much. Both,
      however, raised a brow at the peculiar vanity of fashion.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">It is an accepted truth, thanks to
      historical and archeological evidence, that Gromnies are one of the rare
      original natives of Dereth. These survivors are believed to be the
      juvenile form of a yet unseen creature -- the quasi-mythical “Gromnatross.”The
      main supporting evidence for this theory may be found on the volcanic
      island of Aerlinthe. Records recovered from that port clearly state that a
      Gromnatross called Aurlanaa built a nest upon the peaks of the northwest
      volcano, Cunara. It apparently abandoned its offspring there when the
      Shadows invaded Dereth approximately two thousand years ago. Now on the
      peaks of Cunara, one may still find a small colony of Ash Gromnies.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">The titanic Gromnatross appear to have
      been winged creatures, ranging from cottage-sized to the approximate
      length of the Empyrean Obsidian Span between Cragstone and Arwic. There is
      little more detail available on this presumed adult form. While Gromnie
      motifs may sometimes be found worked into the architecture of the Yalaini
      Seaborne Empire, Gromnatross images are conspicuously absent. It is
      possible that this is due to some religious edict; the Yalain held the
      creatures in high esteem, and may have considered the carving of their
      likeness to be a graven image. Some known details of Gromnatross
      morphology include manta-shaped wings; a long, eel-like luminous tail; and
      milky, radiant lavender eyes. If the Gromnies are indeed but the juvenile
      form, it is to be expected that they share the same cricket-like legs.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, details about the
      Gromnatross' biology and behavior are contradictory at best, and in many
      ways nonexistent. For example, whether the creatures were carnivorous,
      omnivorous, or herbivorous cannot be determined from the records
      available. Although there is evidence that the Gromnatross often killed
      their own young (at which times entire provinces of the Empire apparently
      mourned), there is no mention of them hunting or gathering. Some have
      half-seriously suggested that adult Gromnatross somehow nourished
      themselves by tapping the unusual mana patterns of this world.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Prominent works of literature mentioning
      Gromnatross attribute to them an eerie, inexplicable intelligence.
      However, there are many more references in the Imperial Archives
      discovered under Xarabydun that record their activity as nothing more than
      that of exceptionally large and fierce territorial animals, destroying
      crops and homes in large swathes around their chosen nests. It may be that
      while Gromnatross held a traditional role as a literary symbol, the
      reality was far different. It is no different in our own world, where the
      wild Scavenger Ursuin is used as a symbol of nobility and stoicism in
      Aluvian tales.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">I would be remiss if I did not point out
      that a small faction of the intelligencia maintains that Gromnies came or
      were summoned here at some point by the Empyrean. The basis of this theory
      lies in a handful of obscure old texts in the Falatacot tongue that
      mention: “. . . the hateful wings sent out from dark-lit skies which
      wander the span from one star to another,”and whose “glow'ring eyes
      spill algid light upon the fearful ground.”Aside from their poetic
      appeal, these texts are so notoriously biased as to be considered
      unreliable. Major portions of early Gromnatross lore have reached us
      through the fragmentary religious texts taken from the Gelidites of Frore.
      These ancient people seemed to live in stark fear of the Gromnatross,
      regarding them with horror and awe in equal portions.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">There is one last fringe theory that
      claims the Gromnatross were never natural creatures of this or any other
      world. Rather, they state, some ancient people of Auberean created them
      through lost arcane arts to safeguard their world, much as later
      civilizations created Golems to guard their doors from casual intrusion.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">In any case, these beasts have stalked
      the land for quite some time. Gromnie sculptures were once worked into the
      architecture of granaries, chapels, and ground supports for the floating
      “skytowers.”A matched set of Gromnie figures often flanked the
      thresholds of noble houses in the Seaborne Empire. Interestingly, these
      statues are described as cupping fragrant water in their stony mouths,
      which travelers would use to wash the dust of the road from their hands.
      The implication seems to be that by demonstrating a willingness to place
      his hands in the Gromnie's mouth, a visitor proved he bore no ill will
      toward the resident.</font></i>

      Olthoi”)</b></span><br>
      <br>
      Cuthbert and Archibald stood at the mouth of a cave, donning suits of
      armor -- armor specially enchanted against the fiery breath of the Ivory
      Gromnies within. According to their map, of which each knight insisted on
      possessing exactly one half, this entrance led to a vast network of
      river-carved caves. At the heart of these caves lived the Gromnies.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cuthbert finished donning his own plate
      mail, slinging a spear tipped with a tooth of mystic ice across his back.
      “There must be some semblance of truth behind those theories, of the
      Gromnies being magical constructs. After all, though reptilian, no one has
      yet come across a Gromnie's egg.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Nonsense,” Archibald snorted, hefting
      his own fire-bane shield and winter-blade sword. “Why, myself, I've
      dined many a time on such eggs! A certain cook in Arwic used to sell the
      dish regularly.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“How convenient the town no longer exists
      to substantiate your claim. I suppose this gentle cook died in Arwic's
      tragic destruction?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Archibald sighed melodramatically. “He
      did, poor fellow. Afraid to use the lifestones, he was -- never touched a
      one in all the years he was here. And sure as sure, Dereth's worse off for
      the loss.</font>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ai, great light,”Haimn said,
      kneeling before the beast. “I come from the lowlands, driven out by my
      cruel father. He left me in sleep upon the peak of Verborn. If it please
      you, I would beg your protection this night.”</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">The mighty Gromnatross leaned close to
      the girl, snorting rolling veils of mist into the cold air, one pale
      lantern eye blinking as it peered through the girl's very soul. Then it
      reared and gathered her up, carrying the girl away to its aerie built upon
      the shoulder of a high mountain pass.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">The Gromnatross had but a single chick,
      iridescent jade in color. Haimn bowed before it, but it lunged and bit at
      her. She shrieked and ran across the stony floor of the aerie. Although
      the young Gromnie tried to pursue, the Gromnatross shielded the girl with
      one wing. The enraged hatchling bit and tore at its snow-white flesh,
      vainly seeking Haimn. With a whistling, sorrowful sigh, the pale-eyed
      creature swept the angry child gently away to the edge of the nest.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">The great Gromnatross curled itself
      carefully around Haimn and rumbled soothingly in the depths of its throat.
      By the cool lavender glow of its watchful eyes, the girl fell asleep.</font></i>
      <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">When the golden light of dawn touched
      her, Haimn awoke. The Gromnatross had gone in the night, leaving behind a
      small pile of fruit. The Gromnie chick was nowhere to be seen. After
      eating the fruit, Haimn climbed out of the nest to continue her journey.
      It was then that she saw, sprawled across the rocks at the base of the
      cliff, the broken form of the young Gromnie. Though now in death, its face
      still twisted with bestial rage.</font></i>

      Imperial Legendsinger&nbsp;<br>

      Children,” translated from Yalain by Bretslef of Cragstrone)</b></span><br>
      <br>
      Cuthbert stood over his partner, holding guard with his spear of frost.
      The weapon had proven ideal in the close confines of the caves, holding
      off the Gromnies' sudden charges. They seemed to emerge from the very
      walls, springing from tunnel entrances too dark for the hunters' eyes to
      notice. While the Gromnies' cricket-like legs made it quite slow and
      awkward for them to turn, they remained capable of astonishing bursts of
      speed in a straight line. Both knights panted from the exertion of evading
      in full sets of plate.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More often than not, though, the Gromnies,
      mad with some animal rage, ran straight into Cuthbert's readied spear.
      Archibald would then follow closely behind, finishing the creatures off
      with his frost-dripping sword.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Archibald knelt by the body of the most
      recently slain, using a curved knife to slip the hide from its joints. In
      such a position, he failed to notice anything remiss until his partner
      kneed him cruelly in the ribs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“An Ash!” Cuthbert cried, lowering his
      spear into the charge.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Archibald snatched up his sword in blind
      panic. He would never have seen the more powerful Ash Gromnie if it
      weren't for the electric crackle of its breath. What now? They had
      prepared frost and fire-bane for the Ivories, but what against an Ash's
      lightening breath?</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Now is the time to return my ring,”
      Cuthbert yelled, holding out one hand. “I can use its magic to protect
      us from this beast.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Have I a choice?” Archibald replied,
      reaching into his belt pouch. “They may say I've the strength, but not
      the dull sense, of a Lugian.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He passed the ring over.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Slipping the painstakingly inscribed band
      of hematite onto his finger, Sir Cuthbert found the benighted ways of the
      School of the Right Hand clear in his mind. Pattern formed from chaos.
      There -- the energies wove themselves in ways simple and beautiful. All
      around, magic flowed and whirled in warm, tingling torrents. Little wonder
      mages became so engrossed in their spellcraft. The world seen only with
      the spirit eye was wondrous and strange.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I wouldn't be so sure of that,
      Archibald,” he said. Cuthbert gathered the fine tendrils of energy
      drifting before him, caressing and prodding them into new alignment.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Eh?” Archibald grunted, sheltering
      behind his shield as a crackling sheet of electrical fire washed over it.
      “What. . . no!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cuthbert dissolved, smirking, in a whirl of
      violet bubbles, leaving Archibald behind, blinking in amazement. . . and
      quite alone with the Ash Gromnie.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Bugger all this,” Archibald cursed.</font>
