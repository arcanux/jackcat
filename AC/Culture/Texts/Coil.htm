	Turbine Site</a></font><p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Part 
	One</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Eye of The Sleeping One had opened in 
	less time than it took to gut a Moar; Morgluuk and Torgluuk had seized the 
	opportunity for their race. Hundreds of years of servitude and abuse would 
	be rectified by fulfilling the greatest prophecy of the Burun. They would 
	cross the vast Pide and destroy the matron saints of the Fiazhat race, a 
	race that for several millennia ruled the surface of Bur and brought the 
	burning lands to cover the face of the world.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">They had acted swiftly when the coil 
	shattered and the whir of the endless tunnel hummed to life. Torgluuk, at 
	the prodding of his brother Morgluuk, called to their clutch, promised them 
	glory beyond the endless tunnel and incited them to the point of frenzy. 
	Volunteers poured forth from the youngest of the clutch, some no more than 
	three years from their shells, and they were sent in large squads into the 
	tunnel.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the Eye had opened, most of the clutch 
	had taken to swimming beneath the waters of the swamp and moving to the 
	mire’s edges, where the Eye would dry the muck into a soft crust. There they 
	would rest, placing mucor stumps between their lips and draining the 
	intoxicating juices. Mucor only gained its potency when the Eye drew across 
	its hood. It was a delicacy enjoyed by all Burun, and one that had been 
	missing for one hundred and twelve years. During all that time the Ruuk had 
	been bereft of this taste.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">During their years beneath the world’s face, 
	the Kukuur had developed a method to grow the mucor in underground caverns 
	and achieve the same effect upon the mushroom that the Eye had on the 
	surface world. Since the Eye had last closed and wept, they were the only 
	Burun to have access to the tasty concoction; they were loathe to allow any 
	other Burun to enjoy the taste. Mucor was the most sacred of the fungus that 
	The Sleeping One had gifted to the children of Bur, as was evident by the 
	change that happened when placed in direct view of the Eye. Kukuur elders 
	believed that the strength of the intoxicant was too great for an ungifted 
	shaman to control, so they restricted the intake of the mucor’s juice to 
	only the most eld: the six masters. The Kings of Bur’s clutches.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, mucor was stolen on occasion by 
	wily and unwise Ruuk youths. Those who were not indoctrinated to the way of 
	The Sleeping One would fall into spasms that collapsed their lungs and ate 
	their insides clean. Those who were given over to The Sleeping One’s art 
	would sometimes die in horrific throes as well, but more often than not they 
	would achieve a euphoric state that made them nearly insensate. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cultivated or properly harvested mucor had 
	quite a different effect. Some remembered the proper ways to cultivate and 
	harvest the potent mushroom; others relied on the teachings of those with 
	the memories of prior lives to cut the fungus for them. Torgluuk was one who 
	remembered. The lives he had lived in the past ran strong within his veins 
	and soul; the gifts of The Sleeping One had only enhanced those memories and 
	abilities. He had taught his clutch to harvest correctly many years before, 
	and this auspicious time was the first that the clutch had opportunity to 
	put his teaching to use.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the two passings of the Eye since the 
	endless tunnel had opened, there was only one death from a poorly harvested 
	mucor, though many instances of euphoria had been recorded. Torgluuk took 
	great pleasure in that fact. It meant that the teachings of the only noble 
	Kukuur he had known were true. A mentor, Tkrowerk, had once told him that 
	splitting the mucor along the center of the shaft before snapping the root 
	clear of the ground and tapping the top of the hood would drive the spores 
	into the juice, where they would dissolve into the fluid and bring the 
	euphoria. He had taught this to his clutch and it turned out Tkrowerk had 
	not lied. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Upon reflection, Torgluuk realized, the 
	events of the past two passings of the Eye had been Tkrowerk’s legacy. 
	Tkrwoerk had taken Torgluuk under his tutelage some eighty years prior. He 
	taught him the black rites of soul shredding, and the ways of the fungus. He 
	taught him the language of the Fiazhat, explained how the Kukuur kept 
	control of the massive hulks, the Guruk and how they kept the Ruuk firmly 
	under their control. Tkrowerk was a Kukuur who saw corruption within the 
	hierarchy of the Kings, he wanted change and for that insolence he was 
	struck down and soul-shred. His memories and knowledge lost to Bur, all save 
	that which was passed to Torgluuk. Often Torgluuk wondered how much of that 
	knowledge had been passed to him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the violet glow cast by the endless 
	tunnel, Torgluuk now sat in contemplation. No others were present, and he 
	cast his thoughts to Tkrowerk and the things that he had told him of these 
	days.</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>All things that are, are gifts of The

		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>We cannot forget that the Fiazhat,

		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>I know that I shall not be present

		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>You, little Torgluuk, will have what

	</blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What choices will I face?” Torgluuk asked to 
	the air.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Choices that will bring glory and 
	immortality to our clutch.” Morgluuk peered at his brother over the rise of 
	the outcropping upon which Torgluuk sat. As he came into view, Torgluuk saw 
	the mud shell that covered his body.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Did you draw from the sidelong mucor?” 
	Torgluuk asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“No.” Morgluuk leapt into the air and landed 
	in a crouch; the mud shell cracked and splintered apart in several areas, 
	exposing his deep purple flesh beneath. “I felt it best to keep my wits 
	about me. My savages are also partaking only of the properly harvested 
	fungus. We are aware of the Moar moving closer. Three packs, underburrowers 
	and breathers. Not the same fire breathers with talons of ice that were 
	coming before. There are a great many more now. They hear the call of their 
	mothers.” Morgluuk’s tongue shot from his mouth suddenly and snagged a 
	bomutur wasp from the sky. A mystical charge sputtered as the wasp was 
	quickly tucked into his gullet. “We need to call the clutch together. There 
	has been no word from those who crossed the vast Pide.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes,” Torgluuk nodded in agreement and 
	tapped the edge of the koruu koruu fungus. At once a brilliant blue light 
	appeared beneath its hood. Above them the Eye of The Sleeping One drew 
	toward the horizon; soon night would fall and darkness would consume the 
	land. “I have already Pined the truth of why they have not returned.” It was 
	a lie, but Morgluuk was none the wiser. “The Sleeping One tests us. Any who 
	pass through the endless tunnel will not return until the gods beyond have 
	been swept clear. Only then can we return to Bur and claim our rightful 
	place over the Kukuur and Guruk.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Morgluuk’s mouth twisted into a wide grin and 
	exposed his rows of jagged teeth. “I am pleased. How soon before we pass 
	into the tunnel, brother.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Soon, Morgluuk. First we must make The 
	Sleeping One’s desires clear to the clutch. Then we must make preparations 
	to alert other clutches. We cannot stop with this temple alone. Our 
	subterfuge will not last and then the Kukuur will follow us and try to strip 
	the victory from our talons.” He rose slowly and stepped to his brother. 
	“Can you and your savages manage more bomutur for a feast?”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Do you think we cannot?” Morgluuk 
	challenged. Torgluuk placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder and squeezed 
	lightly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“See it done my brother. Tonight we discuss 
	our plans for the conquest of another world.”&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<center><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Part Two</b></font></center>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The meal had been satisfying. In the muck, 
	the entirety of the clutch waited for their leaders to stand on the branch 
	of the muloo tree and speak of what would come next. Ugluur was among them.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ugluur was a soothsayer who often led some of 
	the younger chosen of The Sleeping One in chants, prayers and song. He 
	respected the ways of the Kukuur and the hierarchy of Bur and had reviled 
	the decisions made by Morgluuk and Torgluuk since the tunnel had been 
	opened. He knew that Morgluuk held more sway with the Shaman than a lowly 
	savage ever should. In the interest of self preservation however, Ugluur had 
	wisely kept his thoughts silent. There was no reason to earn the ire of the 
	leaders while zealotry was so rampant amongst the clutch. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He sat in the swamp crouched to his ears. The 
	water was cool and chilled the heat that coursed over his flesh. Unlike so 
	many others within the clutch he had decided to not waste his day caked in 
	muck, sucking down the juice of the mucor fungus. That was the province of 
	the Kukuur and he had seen the seizures that gripped the fool who had tried 
	to harvest the mucor and failed. He waited in silence. About him there were 
	other soothsayers and several warriors that would protect him should he 
	speak his mind. They thought much as he. He had quelled their tongues and 
	saved them the wrath of Morgluuk’s savages but this night would decide 
	whether he could help them longer or if he would need to let them suffer the 
	fate of returning to The Sleeping One’s mass.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Several moments passed and then Morgluuk made 
	his way to the outcropping. From there he leapt to a vine and swung into the 
	air, flipping twice and landing on the branch of the muloo tree without a 
	sound. He crouched there and spoke.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“We have spent hundreds of years beneath the 
	girth of kings grown fat on the power that flows so freely through them. 
	They have kept us as the bomutur wasp keeps its young; beneath the scum of 
	the swamp, away from the seats of power and legend. We rot here on the 
	outskirts of Bur, while they sup on the fattest fruits of the yola tree and 
	enjoy the protection that our weapons, claws and teeth afford them from the 
	Moar. We have suffered for hundreds of years, brothers; but no more!”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The clutch cheered and croaked in assent, 
	chanting Morgluuk over and again. Praise was given to The Sleeping One and 
	thanks for the return and opening of the Eye. There was a palpable rapture 
	washing over the crowd. For a moment Ugluur felt it too. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Sleeping One has called to us and we, 
	The Clutch of Tkoruk Guruul, have answered!”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another rousing burst of cheer spread through 
	the crowd. This time Ugluur could not fight the desire to cheer with his 
	clutchmates and soon he found himself chanting Morgluuk’s name in unison. 
	Their voices spread through the night and they knew that if there were Moar 
	stalking them this night they would think twice before entering the area of 
	Tkoruk Guruul.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Morgluuk raised his arms and hushed the 
	clutch. “Brothers have already passed into the endless tunnel and we wait 
	still for their answer. My brother, Torgluuk, has heard the whispers of 
	discontent.” Ugluur glanced about him quickly, had he been discovered? A 
	chant rose discounting Morgluuk’s statements and Ugluur joined in 
	emphatically. His head swam and he realized that there had been something 
	done to the bomutur flesh. “That discontent will end this night!”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Waves of chanting broke out in unison again. 
	Ugluur sank beneath the surface of the mire and swallowed a large gulp. What 
	had been done to the bomutur? Could it be the harvested mucor? Thoughts rang 
	through his head with such speed that he thought he might scream. The 
	warriors who he once thought would defend him with their lives now chanted 
	for Torgluuk and Morgluuk with such vigor that he feared they might turn on 
	him for suggesting they fall silent. They may yet know that he meant to 
	subvert their claims and bring word to the Kukuur. He shook his head beneath 
	the surface of the swamp and blinked twice before surfacing to hear the 
	cheering fall to a dull roar as Torgluuk walked to edge of the Tkoruk Guruul 
	Temple and raised his arms.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Clutchmates! We have been gifted with an 
	opportunity to prove ourselves the greatest of the races of the Burun. We 
	are at the center of prophecy and we must heed the will of The Sleeping One 
	and recognize that he has cast his Eye upon this clutch, above all others!” 
	He paused but kept his hands raised. The gesture signaled that he needed 
	silence. “Brethren have walked through the endless tunnel and have not 
	returned. This is true. But what we did not know, we now learn.” The crowd 
	listened with intensity, but Ugluur was clearing his head. He mumbled spells 
	beneath his breath and forced the drugged meat from his body. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Sleeping One desires the eradication of 
	the false gods who scarred the surface of Bur and allowed the corrupt 
	Fiazhat to rule the world in our stead! But this test is one that we cannot 
	fail, or our souls and our bodies are forever lost beyond the tunnel on the 
	world of the Fiazhat gods, across the vast Pide.” Silence still. Ugluur felt 
	his body purging the poisoned meat and felt his faculties returning. 
	“Brethren, this is our task. We must split our clutch.” Murmurs sprang up 
	here and there, but a quick hiss from Morgluuk silenced those foolish enough 
	to protest. Ugluur’s mind was nearly whole again now. “Some will accompany 
	Morgluuk and I to the Clutch of Yurko Utaal, the rest will pass through the 
	tunnel and establish a home on the world of the usurpers. There you will 
	await our arrival. We shall join with the Clutch of Yurko Utaal and make our 
	way back to the tunnel to join you; then as one we will overthrow the gods 
	who would destroy Bur!”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Torgluuk dropped his hands to his side and 
	the clutch erupted in a frenzy of cheers, chants and croaking for several 
	moments. Ugluur hopped from the safety of the swamp into the vines of a 
	nearby toluu tree during the reverie.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What of the Kukuur?” Ugluur called. The 
	clutch fell silent. A low growl could be heard coming from the muloo tree. 
	There, Morgluuk bared his rows of teeth toward Ugluur. “Will they be told? 
	Or will you have us defy our masters and purchase the shredding of our 
	souls?” Angry croaks began in the crowd and Morgluuk crouched to leap toward 
	Ugluur. Torgluuk raised his hands, and all fell silent. In the darkness, 
	none could see who had called out this challenge. Ugluur felt his heart beat 
	faster and knew that his breath had quickened, but he felt vindicated that 
	he had made the stand. If The Sleeping One saw this as his final moment, so 
	be it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Kukuur have stood atop too many Ruuk 
	corpses; they have made the Ruuk shoulder their frailty and inability for 
	too long. <i>This,</i>” Torgluuk gestured to the violet glow of the tunnel, 
	“is a sign of The Sleeping One: the sign that we, the Ruuk, are his chosen. 
	We will heed this call. The Kukuur will learn of this in time and may well 
	pursue us through the endless tunnel.” Torgluuk paused and Ugluur considered 
	his response. As he opened his mouth Torgluuk began again. “But what will 
	they find?” Torgluuk paused briefly and then spoke in a deliberately 
	syncopated rhythm “A world in ruin!” Torgluuk’s hands dropped and the 
	teeming mass of the clutch leapt as one. Ugluur shifted uncomfortably in the 
	vines, preparing to leap away quickly. “We will go to the home of the 
	Fiazhat gods, we will bring the cleansing life with us and we will overrun 
	all that world has to offer! There will be none who survive! We shall scour 
	that world clean, we shall boil the entrails of Bur’s enemies and sup on 
	their souls! We will prove that the Ruuk are the true rulers of Bur and 
	chosen of The Sleeping One!” Torgluuk’s last statement was so loud that the 
	Kukuur very well may have heard it thousands of miles away.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Madness overtook the clutch and Ugluur 
	watched in awe and horror. Never in his days had Ugluur seen such lunacy. 
	Weapons were drawn and slammed against shields; his clutchmates leapt from 
	the swamp base into the trees and danced as if possessed. The sound was 
	deafening: a torrent of splashing water, bone against hide, voices raised in 
	alarming unison, chanting for Torgluuk as if <i>he</i> were The Sleeping 
	One. The cacophony did not dull; it rose to crescendo and threatened to wane 
	time and again only to begin crashing like the tides of the great sea once 
	more.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ugluur leapt from the safety of the vines 
	away from the Temple of Tkoruk Guruul. He leapt into a nearby moluu tree and 
	heard the bone sword drawn behind him. Morgluuk had given chase.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Where do you mean to go, soothsayer?” 
	Morgluuk’s voice was thick with the threat of murder.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I will warn the Kings and they shall come to 
	crush this insurrection. You are mad with power, you and your brother,” 
	Ugluur spat back. He was not afraid of Morgluuk, or so he told himself.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ha! Your innards will feed the swamp this 
	night and I shall hunt your eggs and spill their contents. I will make that 
	my makeshift casting of the soul-shredding,” Morgluuk challenged. He leapt 
	to within two branches of Ugluur, but Ugluur stood his ground and drew his 
	sickle and shield. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You will do no such thing.” The voice was 
	Torgluuk’s. In the swamp behind them, the teeming mass of Burun chanted, 
	screamed and sang to The Sleeping One and to Torgluuk and Morgluuk. “Ugluur 
	will leave here with his head, heart, soul and innards intact, my brother.” 
	Morgluuk gnashed his teeth and clamped his jaw tight. “Go join the others, 
	Morgluuk. I will return shortly.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Morgluuk pointed his sword toward Ugluur 
	briefly, then leapt down toward the maddened crowd.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Why, Ugluur?” Torgluuk asked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You are a shaman, not an elder. Only elders 
	can interpret the will of The Sleeping One. You overstep yourself!” Ugluur 
	replied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I say you have let the King’s poison enter 
	your head so that you do not think for yourself.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Think what you want, zealot. You go against 
	the very order of all there is and expect that you shall live! You are the 
	biggest fool that the Ruuk have ever whelped and you shall be the undoing of 
	us all,” Ugluur protested.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“So you say.” Torgluuk crouched and remained 
	very calm.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I could kill you now and end this madness,” 
	Ugluur threatened.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You would make me a martyr, damn your soul 
	to nothing and drive that mob through the tunnel as one. My eggs would hatch 
	with the knowledge of my lives, but yours… my brother would find them and 
	drink them. You would be given the <i>pitiful end</i>.” Torgluuk shifted to 
	a more comfortable position. Ugluur inched closer. “If you so wish to end my 
	existence and spill my innards to the swamp I will not protest.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You’re mad.” Ugluur shook his head in 
	disbelief.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What you call madness I revere as 
	enlightenment.” Torgluuk moved back to a crouch. “I have spared your life 
	this night, Ugluur. But I cannot save you. You are dead even now, though you 
	know it not. I promise you, my brother, you will know all there is to know 
	about the <i>Kings </i>and your place before your soul is stretched thin and 
	cast from all there is. That choice is yours. I would have bled by your side 
	and stood with you in victory against our enemies on the other side of the 
	tunnel.” Torgluuk shook his head and Ugluur felt the rage within him giving 
	way to fear. “Go. You will need this night. I will need to appease Morgluuk 
	by letting him set hunters on you. They will be weaker, but still able to 
	skin your hide.” Torgluuk moved along the vine to Ugluur and placed a hand 
	on his shoulder. Ugluur lowered his sickle as Torgluuk approached. “I am 
	sorry that it was you this task came to, brother.”</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With that, Torgluuk turned and dropped from
