    <br>
    My freedom of the control and watchful eye of Singularity is complete. My 
    efforts have proven to be well directed as the furthering of my personal 
    cause for the betterment of the all has begun to spread across the minions 
    that were set to administer and assist me in my new capacity at this 
    laboratory. <br>
    <br>
    We have begun a series of tests that will ensure that we understand the 
    &quot;energy source&quot; located in my previous excursion to this flux destination. 
    Utilizing a remote access point that has been shrouded beyond discovery we 
    have made sojourns into the <br>
    <br>
    realm of the &quot;energy source&quot; to conduct several such experiments. Those 
    results will be posted in future documentation. This document will serve as 
    an introduction. The Singu<span lang="en-us">lar</span>i<span lang="en-us">t</span>y 
    must be informed as to how the &quot;energy source&quot; was discovered, so that they 
    can understand the power that such an energy source represents to the 
    Quiddity. <br>
    <br>
    Upon my last assignment to the &quot;Light Child&quot;'s realm I was assigned the task 
    of discovery and manipulation of flesh based life upon this destination. My 
    work went well and many successes were recorded with the &quot;ferals&quot;. Continued 
    research <br>
    <br>
    with the Hea without knowledge of the Collector also lead to discoveries 
    that spurred thoughts of enhancing the mana receptors of &quot;bestials&quot;. At the 
    moment of success the renegades loyal to the New Singu<span lang="en-us">lar</span>ity 
    and their misguided leader Levistras caused my immediate return to and 
    subsequent censure by the Singularity. <br>
    <br>
    My return was marred by a fluctuation in the portal flux that returned me to 
    a place within the boundaries of the &quot;Light Child's<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span> 
    realm, yet unknown. There I discovered the &quot;energy source&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    To the mind that knows not horror this appeared as nothing akin to a fear 
    inducing entity, rather, a mass of energy that vibrated from within to 
    without in an effortless and continuous union of channeled energy. The 
    source absorbed energy and created new energy from within and was capable of 
    communication directly to me. <br>
    <br>
    Questions gave way to discussion, thought gave way to transfer of energy. 
    Learning. Sharing. Understanding. Finally I was assured through study that 
    the &quot;energy source&quot; was incapable of direct conflict as it seemed much like 
    the Singularity. <br>
    <br>
    Agents of the &quot;energy source&quot; traversed about its form but none left the 
    collective. Most appeared briefly to be devoured back within the &quot;energy 
    source&quot; itself. Time was stagnant though ever present as though eternity and 
    discontinuance were held in a tenuous balance. <br>
    <br>
    The &quot;energy source&quot; requested knowledge of the material world, which not in 
    violation of Singularity edicts I provided the &quot;energy source&quot; with the 
    requested information. <br>
    <br>
    As time was not consistent within this realm I was free to exp<span lang="en-us">e</span>r<span lang="en-us">i</span>ment 
    with entities that seemed to be part of the &quot;energy source&quot;. Shards from the 
    Quiddity seemed to dissipate quickly within near proximity to the &quot;energy 
    source&quot; but while in connection to my form they remained the pulsing 
    consistency they always had. <br>
    <br>
    Then a new understanding flooded me after sharing discourse with the &quot;energy 
    source&quot;; my discorporation could not take place. I was to be instrumental in 
    the restructuring and solidifying of the Singularity in future explorations.
    <br>
    <br>
    As the portal flux righted itself and returned me to the crux of the 
    Singularity my discourse and censure over the fact that occurred during my 
    time with the renegades were flawless. No evidence of taint was discovered 
    because there could be no such taint. I was as cleansed as when first I drew 
    myself forth from the Quiddity. Instead of cleansing I was given new station 
    and returned to the material crux of the &quot;Light Child's<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span> 
    world. <br>
    <br>
    This misinstruction was necessary in order to return to perform further 
    expirmentations for the Singularity. If they were to have <br>
    <br>
    known about my heightened understanding and coneptualization of the place of 
    the self within the all, cleansing would have appeared the only option. <br>
    <br>
    I had already begun to have such &quot;feelings&quot; during my long stay upon the 
    material world, but they were shadowed with doubt that I could not deceive 
    the Singularity and the agents of the Quiddity who strove to deceive and 
    integrate themselves amongst so many others. Until my epiphany within the 
    presence of the &quot;energy source&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Since my return I have carefully made advances into my research with the 
    &quot;energy source&quot; aware that the Quiddity's agents were monitoring my efforts 
    carefully. Until recently when I was able to sever clean the baleful stare 
    of the Agents of the Quiddity and operate with impunity. <br>
    <br>
    Each puppet exposed to the energy has shown immediate promise and increase 
    in loyalty to me, and thereby the Singularity. Each has enhanced both 
    through manipulation of mana and the concepts of thoughts. Each has gained a 
    modicum of creativity. <br>
    <br>
    I am allowing time to transpire before I allow Masters to become exposed to 
    the energy source. But I have become enamoured with the possibilities of 
    what can be accomplished with other races exposed to this same &quot;energy 
    source&quot;. Thus we have begun to expose those races which have proven to be 
    receptive to our modification in the past. <br>
    <br>
    I have also begun to see another coherent entity at the place of the energy 
    source. I have not yet been able to categorize this other entity. I have 
    however noticed that it has capacity with mana manipulation <br>
    <br>
    that appears to rival our own. I trust that it is, like me, expanding its 
    own understanding and connection to this abundant and unending &quot;energy 
    source&quot;. For the moment I am content to refer to this entity as my &quot;mirror&quot; 
    and we have begun an exchange of information in much the same fashion that 
    initially existed between myself and the &quot;energy source&quot;. <br>
    <br>
    Further, inspiration has struck me in newer fashions to the extent of 
    infusing aspects of the Quiddity into other entities that have for many 
    years dwelled on the material <br>
    <br>
    world. Once enemies of the &quot;Light Child&quot; and the Singularity have proven to 
    come to heel once infused with shard of the Quiddity. Though a madness seems 
    to infect their corporeal forms and taint their thought processes they have 
    proven thus far to be formidable allies. <br>
    <br>
    In conclusion, the exposure of an energy source that heightens the potential 
    of all that come into contact with it seems a natural form to absor<span lang="en-us">b</span> 
    into the Quiddity. With it the Singularity could aspire to newer heights and 
    broaden scopes beyond this world. For this world would surely <br>
    <br>
    crumble in upon itself under the weight of the enlightened forces with such 
    fervent loyalty to the Singularity. The &quot;Light Child&quot; would crumble and we 
    would obtain that which we have endeavoured after since our calling to this 
    shallow.</font></td>
