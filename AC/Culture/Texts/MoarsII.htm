    refreshing change of pace. I have been receiving so many ancient texts that 
    resemble encyclopedias. This appears to be the story of a young Falatacot 
    Priestess and the Falatacot's first encounter with the Moar.&quot;<br>
    Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;This story seems to be written in a 
    confusing poetic style. Many of the concepts and actions are interposed, 
    which make it difficult for even a scholar to discern. I will do my best to 
    simplify it into a form that we can easily understand.&quot;<br>
    Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;Since you have helped me further my 
    understanding of the Moarsmen and the Falatacot, I will help you.&quot;</font><br>

    <p><font face="arial" size="2">This text appears to be the continuation of a 
    previous tome. The opening pages are in particularly horrible condition and 
    thus illegible. However, the pages in the later portions of the book are 
    adequate for translation.<br>
    <br>
    The newly evolved Moarsmen were bred into two castes. The feral Moarsmen 
    were sent back across the vast divide to Bur. Here it was hoped that they 
    would serve as a balance between the zealous Fiazhat and the subversive 
    Burun. At this point, the feral Moarsmen are no longer mentioned in the text 
    and I assume that the followers of the Light simply released them to Bur and 
    set them about their own devices.<br>
    <br>
    The tamed caste of the Moarsmen remained at the side of the Followers of the 
    Light. The Moarsmen served a purpose that the Sclavus did not. The Moarsmen 
    were steadfast guardians and excellent trackers. While the Sclavus were more 
    magically inclined and useful for rites, the Moarsmen were excellent 
    protectors.<br>
    <br>
    The text also mentions that, although the followers of the Light did not 
    agree with the manipulations perpetrated by the Dark Sisters on Bur, they 
    still freely used the Sclavus as servants and mystical aids. The text does 
    not declare whether or not the Followers of the Light created their own 
    Sclavus or if they were using Sclavus created by the Dark Sisters.<br>
    <br>
    Several hundred years after the release of the feral Moarsmen to Bur, the 
    text documents an escape of the tamed Moarsmen into the wilds of the Vesayen 
    Islands. While eventually most were captured, the toll on the wildlife was 
    devastating. A handful of the Moarsmen eluded capture and grew feral on the 
    island. This drastically altered the wildlife of the islands. Fortunately, 
    the Moarsmen had not been able to survive the swim across the strait to the 
    mainland of Ireth Lassel, otherwise the harm to what wildlife existed on the 
    island then would have been grievous.<br>
    <br>
    After several years of searching, the Followers of the Light managed to 
    reign in the escaped Moarsmen. In order to ensure that no further escapes 
    occurred, the sisters enchanted the Moarsmen, mellowing their hunter's 
    instinct and...<br>
