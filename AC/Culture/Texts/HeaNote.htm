      three notes from Aun Hareltah accompanies either the Kalindan or Palenqual,
      Stave of Palenqual or Hoeroa of Palenqual when exchanged with a Hea Totem.</i><br>
    <br>
      Hearken, and your ears shall be opened to the ways of making the Kalindan of Palenqual.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Only one totem of Palenqual may ever be wielded by one keh. Because of this limit, totems are bonded to their master's keh, and will never be lost should you find yourself sprawled before the light of a soulcatcher stone. They may, however, be freely given to another. Be advised that because of the bonding, the spells of the totem may only be activated by he who earned it.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    What you have now is the heart piece alone. As you have chosen to make for yourself the far-killing Kalindan, the heart has been bored to fire the quarrels commonly used by the crossbowmen of your Isparian xuta.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Yet a heart can only beat unto itself if it has no voice, no legs, and no hands to grasp. To give the Kalindan its ability to effect the world about, you must add other totems to it. As the isle of Palenqual is just a place without the creatures and forces that scurry and storm across it, so the Totem of Palenqual is mute without other totems that represent the inhabitants of this isle.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    There are five totems that the elder shamen of the Aun xuta have prepared for use. You must seek these boons from them in the fields of this Marescent Plateau, for they have piled their kindling far from here. They bear a heavy weight for our xuta. Be your eyes and mind open, though, for only three of these five boon-totems may be added to the totem of Palenqual.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of our akiekie, Timaru, will add Timaru's Shelter to the Kalindan. This will increase the bearer's Quickness by ten, and can be layered with additional protections.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Carenzi, the feral underground predators of Palenqual, will add Coordination VI to the Kalindan.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Siraluun, the graceful flightless birds, will add Regeneration VI to the Kalindan.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Storms that crash over this great snow-capped mountains of this plateau will grant the Kalindan the Eye of the Hunter spell, which adds 25% to the damage of all quarrels fired from it.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of Tonk, the newest comer to this isle, evinces knowledge of self, and mastery of one's chosen path. In the case of the Kalindan, it grants Crossbow Mastery VI.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr width="60%">
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hearken, and your ears shall be opened to the ways of making the Hoeroa of
    Palenqual.<br>
    <br>
    Only one totem of Palenqual may ever be wielded by one keh. Because of this limit, totems are bonded to their master's keh, and will never be lost should you find yourself sprawled before the light of a soulcatcher stone. They may, however, be freely given to another. Be advised that because of the bonding, the spells of the totem may only be activated by he who earned it.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    What you have now is the heart piece alone. As you have chosen to make for yourself the stout Hoeroa, the heart has been steeled to withstand the harshest knock against the enemy.<br>
    <br>
    Yet a heart can only beat unto itself if it has no voice, no legs, and no hands to grasp. To give the Hoeroa its ability to effect the world about, you must add other totems to it. As the isle of Palenqual is just a place without the creatures and forces that scurry and storm across it, so the Totem of Palenqual is mute without other totems that represent the inhabitants of this isle.<br>

Be your eyes and mind open, though, for only three of these five boon-totems may be added to the totem of
    Palenqual.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of our akiekie, Timaru, will add Timaru's Shelter to the Hoeroa. This will increase the bearer's natural Armor by ten, and can be layered with additional protections.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Carenzi, the feral underground predators of Palenqual, will add Strength VI to the Hoeroa.<br>
    The Totem of the Siraluun, the graceful flightless birds, will add Rejuvenation VI to the
    Hoeroa.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Storms that crash over this great snow-capped mountains of this plateau will lower the base damage of the Hoeroa, but a well-placed blow will in turn do four times the normal damage.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of Tonk, the newest comer to this isle, evinces knowledge of self, and mastery of one's chosen path. In the case of the Hoeroa, it grants Staff Mastery VI.</font>

      <hr width="60%">
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hearken, and your ears shall be opened to the ways of making the Stave of Palenqual.<br>
    <br>
    Only one totem of Palenqual may ever be wielded by one keh. Because of this limit, totems are bonded to their master's keh, and will never be lost should you find yourself sprawled before the light of a soulcatcher stone. They may, however, be freely given to another. Be advised that because of the bonding, the spells of the totem may only be activated by he who earned it.<br>
    <br>
    What you have now is the heart piece alone. As you have chosen to make for yourself the magical Stave, the heart has been attuned to the flows and whorls of the invisible river.<br>
    <br>
    Yet a heart can only beat unto itself if it has no voice, no legs, and no hands to grasp. To give the Stave its ability to effect the world about, you must add other totems to it. As the isle of Palenqual is just a place without the creatures and forces that scurry and storm across it, so the Totem of Palenqual is mute without other totems that represent the inhabitants of this isle.<br>

    <br>
    The Totem of our akiekie, Timaru, will add Timaru's Shelter to the Stave. This will increase the bearer's Magic Resistance by ten, and can be layered with additional protections.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Carenzi, the feral underground predators of Palenqual, will add Focus VI to the Stave.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Siraluun, the graceful flightless birds, will add Mana Renewal VI to the Stave.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of the Storms that crash over the great snow-capped mountains of this plateau will add the spell of Avalanche to the Stave. This spell will cause great hailstones to fall from the sky, but is inaccurate and can only be used outside. Be aware of the limitations of this spell before you choose it.<br>
    <br>
    The Totem of Tonk, the newest comer to this isle, evinces knowledge of self, and mastery of one's chosen path. In the case of the Stave, it grants War Magic Mastery VI.</font>
