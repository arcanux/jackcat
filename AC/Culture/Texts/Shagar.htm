    There must first come darkness. <br>
    I live in eternal night. Yet- <br>
    My soul is the stronger for it. <br>
    --Hamud ibn Rafik, after the words of Yasif ibn Salayyar </small></font><p><font face="Arial"><small>The school of Shagar Zharala was founded as the instrument of Malik
    Amul's revenge for the blinding of our great prophet, ibn Salayyar. The Milantan betrayers
    never recovered the body of their king, and they learned not to tempt the wrath of
    Gharu'n. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>I have spoken with those who have but recently come through
    the portals to Dereth. Many say that all is not well in the Shagar Zharala. They say that
    the Zharalim have lost their mission. Once they had an honorable purpose: to slay the
    enemies of Gharu'n and protect the nation from threats too subtle for the attention of
    armies. Their reputation once struck righteous fear into the hearts of the weak and
    wicked. Once they had agents in every guild, to keep them to the Dozen Roads of ibn
    Salayyar. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>In the current day, the Zharalim have become tools of a
    corrupt Malik and a decadent nobility. Now it is the Shagar Zharala that is rife with
    turncoats and the spies of other guilds. They confuse its leaders and in some cases
    pervert the hearts of its masters to serve less noble ends. This deplorable state wore at
    the heart of Master Hamud ibn Rafik, the last uncorrupted elder of the school, and he
    spoke boldly against the others.<font color="#6B6B6B">CKS</font></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>For his words he was cursed and censured. He was accused of
    corruption himself, and shunned by his fellows. Over time, the decay of his beloved school
    and the scorn he earned for his uncompromising stance wore away at his heart. It was at
    this time that portals to the new world began to appear. After a particularly fierce
    dispute with his fellow masters, Master Hamud made his decision, and ventured through a
    portal. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Now it is rumored that in the sandy wastes of the new world,
    amid hordes of hostile creatures, Master Hamud gathers allies and creates networks of
    worthy followers. He has pledged to start anew, and to ensure that the this new world will
    be a stronger, purer world. </small></font></td>
