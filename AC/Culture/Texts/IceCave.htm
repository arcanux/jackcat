    1 Our studies of global crisis indicators show a high probability of a catastrophic event
    arriving some time around year 783. Preparations are underway for the fortification of our
    store of knowledge, but the Mage Council withholds its resources. I am afraid, for the
    moment, the mountain retreat will need to remain as it is. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 2 Lord Atlan's son shows a disturbing predilection for
    magical innovation. While this in and of itself may be an admirable quality, the lad's
    carelessness and cavalier attitude to the very serious consequences of experimentation are
    troubling. We must hope that the boy does not find himself in a position of great public
    power or responsibility. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 3 ...total lack of foresight in trapping him, or it, in

    rebutted that...&nbsp;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Entry 5 The Chancellor insists that I, of all people, lead an
    expedition to investigate that standing stone on the nearby peak. I admit, the runes of
    old Dericost can be an intriguing and worthwhile subject of inquiry, and its inscriptions
    are uncommonly well-preserved, but one would think that the monolith would be a low
    priority in such times as this. </small></font></td>
