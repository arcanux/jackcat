    After establishment of this facility was complete I set out to find the 
    &quot;Martine&quot; entity. It was embroiled in a battle with outlanders. Oddly it had 
    become enchanted by another of the race of the &quot;Light Child&quot;. It had 
    succeeded in fusing our understanding of the hollow shift with the carapace 
    of the &quot;hive parasites&quot; and had obtained a loyal collective. <br>
    <br>
    Posing as the &quot;Martine&quot; entity I convinced one of the members of its 
    collective to obtain a specimen for me from the cold sections in the north. 
    Once meatling was slain while the other suc<span lang="en-us">c</span>eeded.
    <br>
    <br>
    Capture of a lesser form of the mattekar was simple. The &quot;grey ones&quot; 
    furnished this name upon inquisition. They were bred and then destroyed so 
    that I could use their offspring for testing. Further harvests may be 
    necessary as my supply is now exhausted and a modicum of success was 
    achieved. <br>
    <br>
    Five offspring came from the process. The first was examined to further 
    understand the consistency of the meat body. Cessation resulted. <br>
    <br>
    The second was altered in the same way as the reedsharks given to Hea Tupera. 
    The <br>
    <br>
    implant took naturally to the beast. <br>
    <br>
    The third was unaltered when brought before the energy source. <br>
    <br>
    One of the remaining two has been placed in stasis for future examination 
    and the the last of the remaining two is catalogued in stasis. <br>
    <br>
    Findings: <br>
    <br>
    The unaltered beasts was taken to the energy source where it was exposed for 
    the same length as the &quot;croakers&quot; had been. <br>
    <br>
    After a moon cycle the beast was nothing like it had been. It had taken on a 
    bipedal stance, grown arm structures a torso rippling with meat structure 
    beneath a partially furred hide. Twisted and dark with physical prowess and 
    a ferocity unmatched. I returned to find 3 enhanced Puppets destroyed and 2 
    fighting for continued existence. The mattekar was destroyed without further 
    discovery. <br>
    <br>
    After the failure of the puppets I brought the altered beast into the 
    presence of the energy source. There I remained with 3 enhanced puppets and 
    waited while the <br>
    <br>
    moon cycle waxed. During that time I witnessed the transformation. <br>
    <br>
    The hind leg withered and crumble to dust. The front legs twisted and 
    obtained a new joining. The torso shifted upward as the spine structure 
    straightened upward. Fur withered and fell off in clumps and patches. The 
    flesh of the face twisted and the horns of the beast grew longer and more 
    twisted. It adopted a new stance and began to communicate through grunts and 
    chortles. Arms sprung from the center of the torso and the implant allowed 
    for the creature to harness mana. <br>
    <br>
    Puppets were taken by surprise as the assault began. I, however, was 
    prepared. The mattekar was dispatched without chance for further discovery. 
    I have decided to hold other specimens in stasis until further thought can 
    be al<span lang="en-us">lotted t</span>o alteration of this sort.<br>
