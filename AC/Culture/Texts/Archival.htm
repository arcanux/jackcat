    <align="left"><font class="BaseMsgFont"><font face="Arial"><small>Dispatch
    from the northern town of Daralet, received by the court of Emperor Caerlin in the year
    366 of Rhethis Eipoth. Copied by the scribe Wenheas for His Majesty Emperor Caerlin II's
    archive in the year 12 of Torethis Eipoth. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>To
    His Majesty Caerlin, Most Dignified and Enlightened Ruler of the Seaborne Empire of
    Yalain, Right-Trusty Regent of the Shattered Throne of Haebrous, Sovereign of Glystaene
    and Nesortania, and Chevaird-Commander and Protector of the Dericost Marches. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>From Sir Walthryl Senjanh, Viceroy of Daralet, Chevaird of
    the Gilgranne Order, and Bearer of Banner of Old Relmontaine. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>My Lord and Master, </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>It is with deep regret that I must inform His Majesty of a
    most distressing turn of events, and appeal to Him, in His boundless munificence, for
    assistance in remedying the calamity which has befallen my demesne. Within the last month,
    nearly all the children of Daralet have disappeared. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>It began with the orphans of the region, who are oftentimes
    left unprotected and unwatched at night. It is thought that the first to disappear in such
    a fashion was a Dericostian orphan of twelve years, by the name Myshenna. She had
    absconded from the orphanage run by Elder Naelidrye, the local missionary, while the Elder
    slept. The girl had arranged for a tryst with another orphan, Vendiir by name, in one of
    the stables on the edge of town. When she did not present herself for morning prayers, the
    missionary went searching for her. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>She discovered the boy babbling that &quot;the night had
    taken her away&quot; (his words). He was crazed with fear, and claimed to have heard
    Myshenna shrieking in pain and despair from somewhere in the clouds above. The Elder had
    to magically dull his wits in order to calm him. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>We at first thought that he had killed her in a jealous rage
    - the passions of the youth of Dericost are legendary, if His Majesty will pardon me for
    saying so - and had gone mad from guilt. However, on the following morning, no fewer than
    seven children had gone missing from the rolls of Elder Naelidrye's orphanage.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>At this point, the townspeople threw themselves into a
    hysterical panic, and virtually besieged my modest keep with demands that I deploy the
    guard. I do fear that my soldiers were left with little recourse but to be firm with
    several of the more alarmed residents. Despite this lack of reason among the people, I did
    ask several of my more trustworthy chevairds to keep watch around the town that night. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Though not a one of them heard nor saw anything untoward,
    four children of respected Daralet families disappeared from their homes. The following
    morning there was a small riot as the news spread, but my soldiers and I suppressed it
    with some alacrity. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I would spare His Majesty further tedious detail on the
    matter. The facts are plain, and maddeningly repetitious. Every night, anywhere from a
    single to a dozen children have disappeared, despite the presence of alert guards. There
    are but a handful left as I scribe this missive; I expect that by the time His Majesty
    receives this, they will be long since disappeared. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Only one thing has been noted as out of the ordinary, aside
    from the disappearances and the related chaos. Sometimes, in the middle of the night when
    the darkness is of such depth and thickness such that a candle cannot illuminate its own
    handle, we hear whispered voices. They are distant, as if carried on the wind, and seem to
    be chanting. We have made forays into the darkness to seek out their source, yet they
    never seem to be nearer nor farther. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Sir Seddan, a chevaird of considerable skill from Glystaene,
    disappeared himself while attempting to discover the source of these sounds. He had lagged
    behind the rest of his party by not more than a dozen strides when his torch flickered and
    died, as if it had been doused in water. Not a sound was heard. When he failed to respond
    to his party's hails, they returned to where he'd last been seen. There his torch was
    found upon the ground, still smoldering, and nothing besides. His footprints appeared to
    stop in midstride. After this incident, the men have refused to venture beyond the city
    gates. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>More distressing, some of the townspeople have claimed to
    hear the laughter of children at night, coming from the formless sky, or the withered
    fields around this accursed village. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I do beseech His Majesty that He might send aid to His loyal
    vassal in this time of crisis. The events occurring around me are thick with foul magics,
    a power the Elder Naelidrye cannot seem to match. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I must admit that I am helpless against this thing, this
    darkness within the darkness that steals us away without leaving any sign of its passage. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Yours in Faith and Honor,<br>
    Walthryl Senjanh</small></font></font></td>
