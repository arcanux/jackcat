      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nuhmudira began work on these items nearly 
      a year ago. She explained the basics of the transmutation of pyreal and 
      its innate magical properties to a small class of three individuals. Two 
      of them left the Arcanum after hearing the rumors of what she had done to 
      those people in her basement, leaving me as the last remaining member of 
      the Arcanum's Alchemical branch. <br>
      <br>
      I have been working in conjunction with the artificers and the tinkers to 
      decipher many other problem and so I apologize that this manuscript is 
      written with an air of haste. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Pyreal </b><br>
      <br>
      We began the collection of quality and high qua<span lang="en-us">l</span>ity 
      pyreal ingots in the months before and the months after the establishment 
      of the first housing settlements. This is when our study began. The first 
      few attempts were utter failures, entire modules of pyreal were ruined 
      beyond salvation. There was nothing that would consistently strength the 
      bonds that the metal already had. <br>
      <br>
      Our first efforts involved the use of Olthoi Ichor and later Grievver 
      Ichor. Neither did anything more than reduce the ingot to slag. <br>
      <br>
      Later with the discovery of diamond powder we began trying to find a way 
      to coat the ingot in the powder. <br>
      <br>
      Many elixirs were brewed in an attempt to imbue certain enhancing qualit<span lang="en-us">i</span>es 
      onto the ingots, but nothing worked. Our artificers spent their time 
      working on new spells to attempt to strengthen the metal and eventually, I 
      am told, Nuhmudira succeeded at devising a spell that would do just that 
      and hold our elixirs. Hiro<span lang="en-us"> </span>can explain that in 
      more detail than I. <br>
      <br>
      But the spell could only be used on fabricated pyreal, that which had 
      already been molded. The raw form, ingots, were resistant to the spell and 
      so we were left trying to devise a way to embed spells into the pyreal in 
      other ways. <br>
      <br>
      Nothin [sic] was working. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Purpose <br>
      </b><br>
      The purpose was clear from the first day for the four of us that worked 
      with the ingots. We needed to devise a way that we could make a weapon 
      that would be much better at slaying our foes. Nuhmudira was the first to 
      establish who that foe was, the Empyrean. <br>
      <br>
      We, the Arcanum, sat in long deliberation of what our intentions truly 
      were and though we knew that we were making efforts to ensure that our 
      people would have homes, defenses and ways to assist one another. <br>
      <br>
      By the end of a two week deliberation, during which Nuhmudira argued her 
      point so well, that nearly all of the Arcanum agreed that the greatest 
      threat to us on Dereth was indeed the Empyrean, it was decided that we 
      would branch into several different arms. <br>
      <br>
      As such we established the following: <br>
      Agents <br>
      Alchemists <br>
      Artificers <br>
      Librarians <br>
      Researchers <br>
      Spellcrafters <br>
      <br>
      And Tinkerers. <br>
      <br>
      There may well be more as we grew quickly, even though we were removed and 
      separate from the whole of the Isparian peoples. <br>
      <br>
      We, the Alchemists, were set to the task of manipulating the various 
      components and metals of the world in an effort to discover an alloy that 
      could be used to strengthen our weapons to a point where they would be 
      nearly unbreakable and immensely powerful. <br>
      <br>
      When Nuhmudira succeeding in loosing so much of the power that had been 
      locked away into the metals we though that she had succeeded at what she 
      wanted. <br>
      <br>
      We were very wrong. Our struggle had just begun, and we toiled long and 
      hard with no success. <br>
      <br>
      My recent efforts have been subject to the scrutiny of my peers and the 
      people of Dereth as they reel from the news that Nuhmudira had done 
      something less than noble, in fact despicable by most<span lang="en-us">'s</span> 
      standards. We, the Arcanum, are fractured over this news. <br>
      <br>
      When my two direct peers left, I was alone in trying to create these new 
      weapons. While I had seen some success in the crafting of the various 
      elixirs, that entire process had been taken from me and given over to Hiro 
      and the remainder of the Artificers, long ago. <br>
      <br>
      Now I was one lone person trying to calculate a new formula with an alien 
      metal forged on this world. <br>
      <br>
      Frustrating. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Resolution </b><br>
      <br>
      I had all but given up, when I was visited by a tall man that entered into 
      the building without a single sound. He loomed over me as I sat at my 
      workbench and placed a long finger to the left of one of the many pages 
      that were scattered on my workbench. <br>
      <br>
      I remember exactly what he said. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;The metal uses the magic, child, you cannot make new magic that will tame 
      it without first visiting the source of it's power.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      I glanced up and saw his long white beard and amber eyes, Lord Asheron 
      Realadain. <br>
      <br>
      If he knew the purpose of these weapons I was sure that he would have 
      killed me, but instead he went on to explain a great many things to me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our discussion took us long into the next evening from early in the night 
      before. By the end of that time I had lost all fear of this gentle, gentle 
      man. <br>
      <br>
      What he has done for me, has opened the doorway to the forging of these 
      weapons. <br>
      <br>
      He has made efforts to explain what we could not fathom and I have learned 
      from him. <br>
      <br>
      I put to page, in the following leafs, the steps that you will need to 
      create these new weapons and explain the enhancements that will be made to 
      these weapons from what once were the steps for creating the atlan 
      weapons. <br>
      <br>
      Ciandra <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Diamond Oil </b><br>
      <br>
      From the mana stream that Asheron will open to us we will collect pure 
      mana. To that we will add Diamond Powder and depending on how well we brew 
      the mixt<span lang="en-us">u</span>re we shall achieve one of three 
      qualities. Asheron has assured me that the gradient will be visible. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Oil of Nullification </b><br>
      <br>
      This oil is necessary for the creation of the tool that will be used to 
      remove stones from the weapons. To craft it we will need powdered 
      chorizite and the mana from the place that Asheron opens. The oil will 
      then be prepared. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Ingots </b><br>
      <br>
      Only High Quality Ingots can be used, the other grades are not potent 
      enough to absorb the diamond oil. <br>
      <br>
      Using the Oil on the Ingot will reinforce the metal. Depending on how 
      potent the brew and the care you take while infusing the ingot you should 
      receive one of four gradients of Diamond Infused Pyreal Ingots. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Weapon Infusion </b><br>
      <br>
      Once you have created any quality of Diamond Infused Ingots, you need to 
      purchase an infusion tool that will transfer your skill to the ingot 
      itself. <br>
      <br>
      We have supplied Silencia with these stamps, as she also has the Golem 
      that will forge the ingots into weapons. <br>
      <br>
      As you may have assumed you will then give the item to the golem who will 
      forge the weapon within its heart fire. <br>
      <br>
      You should obtain one of four qualities for weapons as well. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Elemental Stones </b><br>
      <br>
      Like their predecessors, the Atlans, our Isparian weapons can be fitted 
      with one of the four elemental stones. Asheron assured us that the Shadow 
      stone would not work. These will enhance you and also cripple you in some 
      ways, but the weapons have been designed to assist us with the growing 
      Elemental problem. Such that they will be much more potent against certain 
      elementals, typically the opposing element. <br>
      <br>
      This is a process that Nuhmudira was searching for, but Lord Asheron was 
      kind enough to show us. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Modifying Tool </b><br>
      <br>
      In order to remove a stone from within the weapon you will need a special 
      tool that uses the previously mentioned Oil of Nullification. <br>
      <br>
      You will need to use the oil on a pure Diamond Heart, this will be only 
      substance strong enough to unbind the stone from the Isparian Weapons. <br>
      <br>
      Once the heart has been imbued with the oil find one who can carve keys 
      and ask them to craft the altered Diamond Heart for you. The result should 
      be a tool that will fit perfectly into the weapon to remove any of the 
      elemental stones. <br>
      <br>
      <i>Notes: </i><br>
      Though potent, these weapons cannot be enchanted, but they will course 
      with the energy of the weapons type at the higher qualities. <br>
      <br>
      Further the addition of the elemental stones will not only increase their 
      efficiency against their opposing elemental type, they will also increase 
      ans [sic] modify the weapon into elemental types, for the major stones. 
      Both major and minor stones should alter the weapon so that they are 
      imbued with some manner of spell, though the major may shed some negative 
      spell upon you it will also increase other areas and offer the enhanced 
      damage against certain elementals. <br>
