    <p><font class="BaseMsgFont"></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 1: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I was able to breach the temple entrance and force my way
    into the tunnel. I could tell immediately no one has been here for many years, maybe even
    centuries! </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">The air is stale and hot. It's difficult for me to make any
    progress in mapping the tunnels because of the air and dust. I find myself struggling to
    continue when the air is so stifling. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 2: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">This is interesting. There are two burial chambers located
    two levels down from the entrance. Both chambers contain stone coffins covered in black
    soot. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I'll have to come back to these chambers later when I've
    finished exploring the rest of the area. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 3: </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Went back to Zaikhal for supplies.</small> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Bought a torch, tools, and enough food to last me the week. </small><br>
    <small><br>
    DAY 4: </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I explored the remaining areas on the first level today. I
    found something of interest...Four separate rooms located at four different corners of the
    temple. Each room has a coffin. Why are these coffins not in the main burial chamber? </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Tomorrow I plan to pry open the coffins. There might be
    something inside them explaining their importance. </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>DAY 5: </small><br>
    <small><br>
    By strength alone I was able to pry the lids of all four coffins. I wasn't surprised to
    see the bones and wrappings of the dead, but I found it unusual that buried with each was
    a key. </small><br>
    <small><br>
    I left the keys where I found them. If I find a use for them I'll come back. Tomorrow I
    hope to explore the remaining parts of the complex. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 6: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Didn't make much progress today. I was hindered by metal
    gates that were sealed tightly. I'm starting to believe the gates were never meant to be
    opened. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 7: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Another sealed gate slowed my progress. On the other side was
    a large chamber and I could hear the sound of fountains. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I couldn't pry or break the gate this time, it was too large.
    I'll have to look for another way into the chamber. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 8: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">There is a second passage from the other side, which leads to
    the same large chamber. And I was right! There are two fountains in this chamber! That
    explains the noise of running water I heard yesterday. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I just found a small area made of small rooms off from the
    main chamber. There<br>
    are two rooms with floor mounted levers. I think I'll leave these alone until I know what
    they go to... </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 9: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I'm running out of food. I'm so close to the end though!
    There are some details I'll have to write down later...I discovered what the levers do and
    found doors that can only be unlocked by those four keys. I don't have time to write the
    details in this entry, maybe later. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 10: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">With what remains of my strength I was able to push open the
    last remaining gate. I must be getting delirious. I keep hearing voices coming from behind
    me...I'm hearing strange noises, like wind, but different, and I can't find the source. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">There is a large audience chamber here with lit candles. I
    don't remember lighting them, but lately I've been having problems remembering things.
    Tomorrow I'm going back to town for more supplies. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">DAY 11: </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Whatever I've done I now know my presence here is not wanted.
    I was awakened last night by voices...And footsteps! I was not dreaming! The dead have
    come back to reclaim what was once theirs. I should have known better than to rush in and
    desecrate something which had been held sacred by them for many years.</font></small></font></td>
