    The days pass slowly. The process of
    weaving the spell is greatly tiresome. It is difficult to make myself feel any
    anticipation or happiness about the fact that we may end the war in a few short weeks.
    Light, to me, has gone grey and distant. It is not that the Darkness has put its thorn in
    my heart; I am simply tired. How strange. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">After all these years, these innumerable battles against the
    enemy, I see our last, best gambit against the Shadows as little more than a task which
    must be completed before I may rest. I feel as a washer woman at twilight, eyeing her last
    basket of soiled clothes with a hand to her throbbing back. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">The master of the Knorr Lyceum should not be a tired old woman,
    but a person of power and vibrancy; a spirit willing to forge boldly beyond the limits of
    current magics - as I did in my youth. This evening at dinner - a quiet, somber affair, as
    usual - I announced that I would give the position over to Asheron. His research into the
    dusty, scribbled theorems of Facill have placed us on our current path. As many eyebrows
    as my decision may raise, I know he will excel in the role. I can only pray that he, that
    any of us, will survive the coming grapple. </font><font color="#6B6B6B">
    SUCKS</font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">All day, again, the six of us worked on the necessary
    enchantments. The crystal array now pulses with a heretofore unknown power, a pulsing,
    amorphous violet swirl. White lightning crackles between the facets of the device. It is a
    beautiful thing that this mad, desperate plan has wrought. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Just this morning I remembered that tomorrow I shall celebrate
    the 524th anniversary of my husband's death. Half a millennium - gods, has it truly been
    so long? When he went north to oppose the massing Shadow-armies, I was still young. My
    hair had not faded from the fiery red of my youth to cool silver. I remember the woman who
    let sweet-smelling gardens of wildflowers and rare spice overflow the courtyards of
    Atlan's castle on the hill of Galann. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I remember the casual way she would gather the butterflies to her
    in spring, and watch them gently fan their wings; the way she would hold out a hand full
    of seed in winter, and bold little checik birds would clutch her fingertips in their tiny
    feet to eat it. She ran through marble halls made miraculous by sheets of red-gold sunset
    light, laughing and singing, her husband straining to catch her in his strong arms. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I remember these things, and I know I was the one who did them.
    They now seem like another woman's life, which I observed from a distance. Now I find
    myself moving through life with slowness and deliberation. They say I have become wise,
    but I do not think that is so. I am a woman disconnected. I have been this way for
    centuries now, but have only just realized. When Atlan died, he took my life and joy with
    him. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">I do not believe that this was due to some foolishly strong
    attachment to him. No, I think it was because he and I grew up in the time between the
    Black Rains and the rise of the Hopeslayer. We did not know the centuries of chill
    darkness our parents braved. We knew only the spring, when the soot and ash stopped
    falling. The world had not seen light for so long that it burst into a rapture of pure
    joy. We were raised in a time that knew only joy, and became innocents. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">When the Darkness fell upon the mountainsides and vales of the
    north, we did not worry. Atlan and his men and women sailed and marched, secure in the
    arts of our people and the killing blades he and I created. In one night, all save one
    were slain or enslaved by the superior arts of the enemy. Our innocence died under the
    shrouded faces of the moons. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Every time since that I have faced the Darkness directly, it has
    been with the fear that I may see, among the colorless ranks, my husband's broad
    shoulders, and the pulsing red heart of the sword we forged together. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">Tonight I saw an enormous gromnatross. She flew across the
    constellations to the south, from Sejaest to Irihane, skimming the tops of the mesas. She
    stood silhouetted by the pale face of Alb'arel for a brief moment, hovering on a thermal
    perhaps, and released a lonely cry into the darkness. I remembered the stories my mother
    told me as a child, about how the great gromnatross know when sorrow is coming, and leave
    for happier places - abandoning their eggs if need be. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">My mother said that during the Black Rains, the gromnatross had
    flown away into the stars, for there was no place on the face of the world which knew
    happiness. When the Rains stopped, they returned to the peaks of our islands. If I were a
    happy enough child, perhaps one would visit me. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">This gromnatross flew swiftly away from Ireth Lassel. I waited on
    the battlements until the rising sun caused the eastern sky to blush, but she did not
    return. In the darkest hours, Adja brought me a thick blanket. Imagine, a powerful
    sorceress giving her fellow a blanket instead of a small warming spell! She has never
    offered an explanation for her people's belief that every use of magic has a consequence.
    I think it may be the influence of the swamp people that once called her island their
    home. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">She stood with me for a time, sipping her strong tea, watching me
    with those odd marble-green eyes. I know her thoughts on our plan; such a gross use of the
    arcane power that flows in unseen currents across the world may cause a worse calamity. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">What choice have we? The sun's light ebbs daily. Darkness is
    ascendant, and our armies still fall, or are turned. We have too few left to resist for
    much longer. This island has become our final redoubt. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#ffffff">At last, I went to my quarters to sleep. I asked the captain of
    the guards to keep watch for the return of the gromnatross, but she still has not been
    seen. I keep trying to tell myself that it is but a child's fable, but I know too well how
    many fables bear the seed of truth. I lost my husband to fables. </font></font></td>
