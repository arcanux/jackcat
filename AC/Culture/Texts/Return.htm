    In the 10th year of our exile, the world cooled, and snows swept across the face of
    Dereth. At that time, many valiant heroes fought their way into the vaults of ancient
    Frore, in hopes of rescuing the lost exploration party of Sir Joffre Tremblant, late of
    Arwic. Foucault, Ali-Zaboo and the other Orion Hunters, Shao, Keth al-Sheth, and other
    brave adventurers fought through scores of Geldite necromancers. In the end, the tortured
    soul of Sir Tremblant was laid to rest, and The Great Work of the Geldites, a magical
    artifact of uncertain origin, lay shattered at the flaming heart of Frore. With its
    destruction, warmth returned to the world.<br>
    <br>
    Here Abrim of Morningthaw recounts the perils he and Kyoujin faced in the bowels of the
    lost city. The blessings of the Dragon Firebird, and Unicorn watch over them - over all
    who descended to the frozen hell of the dead metropolis. Without your sacrifice, we should
    have faced a still, cold doom. Your names should be held in honor forevermore, the first
    champions of a new era in Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    - <em>Fanzen San</em><br>
    <br>
    I knew the end was near. For good or bad, I had come to the end of my journey. I grieved
    the loss of my friend Kyoujin, his body broken by the denizens of this cold, dark place. I
    knew he would be all right, the magic of the lifestone had captured his spirit, protecting
    him against true death, but it was small consolation to me as I stood there over his body,
    wondering how I could go on alone<span lang="en-us">.</span><br>
    <br>
    This was not my first attempt to unravel the mysteries of this Lost City of Frore. The
    last, I had come alone, and had been thwarted by the locks of the City. The Geldites took
    great pains in preserving their privacy, in designing and constructing this place. I
    wandered, cold, and lost, for a long time before finally using my magic to escape the
    darkness, planning to return again.<br>
    <br>
    Return I did, this time accompanied by Kyoujin, an aspiring mage who also had some skill
    with locks. Together, we sought to bring an end to the bitter winter that blankets Dereth,
    not fully understanding the danger of this place, and the power of the forces within.
    Together we fough against the underlying guardians of this place, and had won our way into
    the City. Deeper and deeper we ran, finally coming face to face with Tremblant himself,
    now transformed into a hideous monster, his dead body reanimated by some evil magic.<br>
    <br>
    Kyoujin was no match for him: Tremblant had broken him, and had almost destroyed me as
    well, before I finally managed to bring him down.<br>
    <br>
    Now, as I stood before this doorway, the blistering heat from within was almost welcome in
    this otherwise frigid place. I feared in my heart that I might suffer the same fate as
    Tremblant, doomed forever to guard this dark place.<br>
    <br>
    As I stood there, I relived the long journey that had brought me here in my mind: the
    quest for Tremblant's party, seeking out the pieces of the mystic run transcription, the
    warnings of the translators, the long run to the Plateau.<br>
    <br>
    A sound from within roused me from my thoughts. The Great Work, perhaps sensing my
    presence, had begun to stir.<br>
    <br>
    The time had come for me to face this final challenge. As I opened the door, the heat from
    within washing over me in waves, I sent a silent prayer to the Poet, that my death might
    have meaning.<br>
