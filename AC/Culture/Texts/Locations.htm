    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Preliminary scouting reports that the 
    majority of nests on the eastern half of Dereth, Osteth, have been 
    destroyed. This leaves only the direlands threatened. Four towns, under the 
    protection of High Queen Elysa, have asked for assistance in ridding the 
    land of the Olthoi. I had been dispatched, as an emissary, to speak with the 
    inhabitants of each town, ensuring them that the High Queen will personally 
    lead the charge against the nests here. <br>
    <br>
    With that first task accomplished, I had turned my attention to finding the 
    location of the remaining queens and nests.<br>
    <br>
    A cursory glance across much of the direlands revealed very little of their 
    whereabouts and I grew increasingly concerned. I could feel the ground 
    shaking beneath my feet, which meant that the Olthoi were certainly moving, 
    but had found little in the way of solid proof. My first finding was at Fort 
    Tethana, northward heading toward the northern shore.<br>
    <br>
    There I found the first of the Queens. She was moving about with an elite 
    guard, but as I approached closer she burrowed beneath the earth quickly and 
    disappeared from my sight. She left behind a putrid but unique scent.<br>
    <br>
    I then traveled southward, after scouring much of the plains. I found myself 
    entering the direland swamp and assailed by a host of scents that I had 
    never encountered before. Immediately I thought that there must have been an 
    Olthoi Queen about and prepared to search for more defendable ground. I was 
    disappointed when I found that there was evidence that a Queen was nearby, 
    yet nowhere to be found.<br>
    <br>
    I then made my way further south. There I found more evidence of an Olthoi 
    Queen to the southeast of the Obsidian Plains. She had roosted in one of the 
    craters within the southeastern direlands. Again however, there was no sign 
    of her presence any longer.<br>
    <br>
    Making my way toward the center of the Obsidian Plains I was amazed to see 
    that there were still some Virindi maintaining watch over the center of the 
    blast area. Just outside the inner rim to the north I found more evidence of 
    a Queen. No signs of a nest, though there was a pungent scent in the air, 
    and more olthoi seemed to congregate there than anywhere else.<br>
    <br>
    Finally I turned my attention toward the west and delved into the forests in 
    the north. The golems who once marched through these areas were missing as 
    were all other manner of creature, save for the olthoi. After some more 
    searching and difficult fights I was able to find what I believe to be the 
    final location. I've listed coordinates here:<br>
    13.3N 71.8W<br>
    44.7S 49.6W<br>
    80.7S 43.2W<br>
    58.2S 64.1W<br>
    31.9S 88.7W<br>
    <br>
    They should allow you to find the Queens more easily, but it is difficult to 
    know whether they are willing to come back to the surface.<br>
    <br>
    My best wishes go with you. I shall be seeking the nests within a few days 
    more preparation. I pray you fare well.<br>
