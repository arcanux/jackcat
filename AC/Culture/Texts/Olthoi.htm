      story was written by Chris L'Etoile. (from <a href="http://zone.msn.com/asheronscall/ASHEolthoi.asp" target="_blank">the
      Zone</a>)</em> </font><p><small><font face="Arial">
	<img border="0" src="image_08.jpg" width="92" height="123" align="left">The mouth of
    the cave moaned piteously at me. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Are you certain you want to do this?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Jenavere, my traveling companion of late, leaned nonchalantly
    against the mossy granite of the mountain, idly tapping her staff against the toe of her
    boot. She was a Gharu'ndim woman of rangy build, with a raggedly chopped, dusty-red
    ponytail. Had I not met her while she was cracking an Olthoi carapace with her nabut, much
    as a Sho cracks the shell of a crab, I would have thought it a weapon unsuited for the
    endeavor. That was more than a week ago, before I knew that she was an Olthoi hunter of
    some repute. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">
	<img border="0" src="olthoi1_small.jpg" width="122" height="200" align="right">I nodded. I had heard just enough about these creatures to be
    both curious and wary. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Jena shrugged, and hefted the staff over her shoulder.
    &#147;As you say then. Or rather,&#148; she said, grinning, &#147;as you wrote.&#148; She
    pulled a small rag out from her pack, and tied it over her mouth and nose. I pulled a
    torch from mine, and lit it with the strike of a flint. &#147;Why don't you cover your
    nose?&#148; she asked. &#147;I'm telling you, the smell in these places is simply
    unbearable.&#148; I shook my head, though not unappreciatively, and waved the torch toward
    the cave mouth. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Oh no, after you, noble Hendac.&#148; She bowed. I
    favored her with a wry smile, and ducked into the maw, my free hand on my own staff, a
    small, swift jo of Sho craft. As much as I misliked the aloofness of the Sho, I had to
    admit that they made the finest weapons in the world; nimble and well-balanced. Jenavere
    gracefully turned to march after me. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">After only a few furlongs, all the light, save that of my
    guttering torch, was gone. All I could detect of my companion was her soft footsteps. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">That is when it hit me. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Up from the depths of the cavern rolled a warm wind, heavy
    with moisture. I staggered, as the foulest stench imaginable washed over me, a mix of
    rotting vegetation and insect droppings. Had I a voice, I should have made a noise of
    surprise. As it was, I nearly lost my portion of the rabbit we'd shared for breakfast. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;As I said,&#148; Jena's muffled voice scolded me.
    &#147;Here.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>A colorful scarf, decorated with geometric Gharu'n patterns,
    passed before my eyes, and settled over my nose and mouth. A firm tug secured the knot. I
    turned to her, my eyes still watering from the blast of fetor, and inclined my head in
    gratitude.</small> </font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;No thanks required,&#148; she replied, her dark eyes
    betraying far too much amusement. &#147;Hendac, before we go any further, will you please
    stop and listen to me for a moment?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I nodded, still reeling a little, and crouched against the
    wall, setting the torch on the ground before me. She squatted down, tucking an errant
    strand of hair behind her ear. &#147;I've been here before, you know.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">That didn't surprise me; she seemed quite familiar with the
    landscape of the area. What she said next did surprise me. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;I fought beside Strathelar and Cragstone.&#148; I
    looked at her in frank astonishment, and she shrugged fluidly. She planted the butt of her
    staff against the cave floor, and rested her cheek against it. &#147;When I was younger, I
    traveled with my father, a silk merchant, to your homeland. While we were there, we
    encountered one of that cursed mage's portals. You know the end of that story as well as
    I, do you not? We were both taken by the Olthoi. It was but a few months before open
    rebellion began, but my memories of that time remain . . . vivid. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;There are those who say that the Olthoi are among the
    weakest denizens of their own world, but prevail through superior intelligence and
    organization. I shudder to think of creatures that would make the Olthoi seem weak by
    comparison. Shortly after Strathelar and Cragstone raided the hive that my father and I
    were kept in, I had the opportunity to share a meal with them. Elysa talked, briefly and
    unwillingly, about the time she met Asheron. She had upbraided him for not opposing the
    Olthoi, and demanded an explanation. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The wizard said that the Olthoi were well beyond his
    control, and he could do nothing. He and his apprentices had opened a portal to their
    world as explorers, and the Olthoi, for reasons that remain their own, decided that the
    visitors must be destroyed. They slew the next exploration party, and swept into this
    world like a storm wind. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;There are four known castes of Olthoi. The smallest and
    weakest are the Workers. These do the rote labor of the hive: digging tunnels, nursing the
    larvae, and harvesting the fungus on which they live. Though many believe that the Olthoi
    are carnivorous, this is untrue. They practice a primitive form of agriculture, using
    fungus grown in the deep hive to make a thick broth. This foul concoction can be found
    bubbling in huge vats along the halls. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The next caste is that of the Soldiers. Their digging
    arms are stronger and sharper than that of the Workers, more suited for use as weapons.
    Unlike the Worker caste, Soldiers possess organs which generate acid. They often spit this
    at enemies in combat. These ferocious creatures are normally only seen in the deeper and
    more important areas of the hive -- guarding the nursery and the chambers of the Nobles
    and Queen, for example. They attack anything that is not Olthoi. When their armies marched
    across the land, the Soldier caste was at the forefront of the slaughter. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Above the Soldiers and Workers are the Nobles -- or so
    you Aluvians dubbed them. The Nobles appear to be more intelligent, and responsible for
    certain areas of the hive. One, for example, directed the Workers that harvested the
    fungal crop, and another oversaw those who minded the human slaves. Unlike the genderless
    Workers and Soldiers, the Nobles are male, and fertilized the Queen during their breeding
    cycle, which seems to take place only once every fourteen years. Like Soldiers, Nobles can
    spit acid at enemies. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The Queen was the mightiest and most intelligent of
    them all. There was but one of them on Dereth, praise be, but others must exist on this
    world, on the far side of the great waters. The One Queen slain by Strathelar laid the
    eggs of all the Olthoi still found in Dereth, and was attended by a retinue of Workers and
    guardian Soldiers. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;A Queen leads her brood in several ways. Like all
    Olthoi, she can click and chitter, and it seems she can move her limbs to instruct them in
    a variety of tasks, but for more general and urgent messages, she and the Nobles emit
    smells. The Olthoi sense of smell is far better than our own, or that of any other
    creature we know of. An Olthoi can literally smell what its fellows are thinking and
    feeling, and this causes it to think and feel the same way. I confess, I do not understand
    the principle myself, but the sages of Cragstone are quite convinced that the Olthoi form
    a single, vast mind, in which thoughts and feelings travel vast distances on the wind. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;By emitting the proper smells, the Nobles lead the
    lower castes, and the Queen the entire hive. The Queen's scents were a constant presence
    in the corridors, forming the cornerstone of their society. The loss of a Queen disrupts
    all the Olthoi -- for a time. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;This has been muddled in the course of much retelling,
    such that the common folk now believe the death of the One Queen left the entire race
    without any direction or intelligence. I will tell you, Hendac, and I pray you do believe
    me -- this is a false hope. The Olthoi were affected by the powerful burst of fear-scent
    the Queen emitted upon her death, and dissolved into blind panic. Once they recovered from
    that, the bewildered creatures focused on trying to find her, sparing only the barest of
    attention to the humans who harried them. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Now, they begin to recover. The scholars of Zaikhal
    believe that the Olthoi have retreated underground to regroup . . . and to brood a new
    Queen, surrounding one of their few remaining eggs with the One Queen's royal jelly -- the
    same foul-smelling ichor Elysa's soldiers smeared themselves with to infiltrate her
    chambers. It is not inconceivable that there they are growing multiple queens. Should this
    come to pass, may the heavens help us all -- hundreds and thousands of new Olthoi may
    flood the land. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;I will tell you what lies below us,&#148; Jena
    continued, interrupting my own grim musings. &#147;There will be no light, save that which
    we bring. The vision of the Olthoi is extremely poor, and they rely on their exceptional
    sense of smell to track prey. To find their way through the darkness, they use touch and
    hearing. Sound travels far in a hive, due to the substance they coat the walls with, a mix
    of fungus and their own droppings. They find their way, it seems, by making their strange
    chittering noises, and listening for the echoes. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;The halls will be long and twisting, and virtually
    featureless. Since the Olthoi are not tool users, you will find no trace of the
    decorations other races leave behind them. In the deeper levels, you will find the barren
    nurseries. While no one has seen an egg or a grub since the slaying of the One Queen,
    there may be dozens of hungry, adolescent Nymphs eager to devour you after their long
    pupation. Several months after the wormlike grubs hatch from the Queen's eggs, they spin a
    cocoon around themselves. They may remain in this state for years, before emerging as
    small, soft-skinned Nymphs. Eventually, these grow into members of the lower castes. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;You will find the vats of fungal soup, which humans
    were once enslaved to stir. Workers perform this task now, as they did before our
    captivity. On the lowest levels, there are huge rooms filled with the Olthoi's fungal
    harvest. There you may find some edible mushrooms, but it is more likely you will simply
    be choked by clouds of spores. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;A hive is the most alien and inhospitable place you can
    go,&#148; Jena concluded. &#147;If you still deem your scholarship worth the trouble, I
    shall take you further. I would not have you go alone.&#148; I looked up at her, and saw
    an unexpected softness in her eyes. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I drew forth my jo, which crackled with violet-blue
    electricity, and we continued down the winding passage. A chitter ahead of us brought me
    up short. Jenavere and I exchanged glances, and slid to either side of the hallway. The
    only sound was the sputtering of my torch -- I could not even bring myself to breathe. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">An insect lurched into view, filling the entire hallway.
    Jet-black it was, save for a pair of glowering red compound eyes, which bobbed as it swung
    its sleek head this way and that. I could see small appendages at its mouth working the
    air -- smelling, if what Jena said was true. I turned, and saw her, grim-faced, mouth the
    word &#147;Worker.&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Cautiously, it approached, its massive digging limbs
    polishing each other as it tasted the air to identify us. Perhaps, as nearly blind as Jena
    claimed it to be, it was dazzled by the unexpected light of my torch. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Without a sound of movement, Jena slammed the end of her
    nabut into its eye. It trilled and reeled away, striking limbs flailing madly, bleeding
    green fluid. I dropped the torch. Ducking under a foreclaw, I swung at its belly. As my jo
    grazed it, electrical bolts crackled and sheeted across its carapace, drawing forth
    another unearthly screech. Again, Jena's staff leapt out, sweeping low. With a hideous
    cracking noise, one of the insect's legs gave way, and it crashed to the floor, limbs
    flailing. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Between the two of us, we managed to batter the creature to
    death. It took an alarmingly long time. Finally, as the insect's last remaining limb
    twitched, Jenavere stood over it, her face an unleavened mask of hatred, and thrust her
    nabut straight down into its chest. The obsidian carapace shattered, exposing a quivering,
    unsavory mass of alien organs. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Gasping for breath, I used the butt of my jo to write in the
    dirt, &#147;Weakest?&#148; </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Jena, flicking green slime off her hands, nodded. I could
    barely see her in the purple violet dim of the tunnel. Against the light of the torch,
    still burning on the floor behind her, I noticed her hand trembling in silhouette. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">&#147;Let's leave,&#148; I wrote.</font></small><p>
	__________ </p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Olthoi are a scourge upon the land: insectoid 
	engines of death standing from seven to eight feet tall. They are 
	responsible for the Empyrean's flight from the world, and until recently ran 
	rampant across Dereth. Their numbers have diminished since Elysa Strathelar 
	and Thorsten Cragstone overthrew them, but they can still be found deep in 
	their dark, underground hives. </font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Olthoi are fast, vicious fighters, impaling 
	victims with their huge digging claws and eviscerating them with their 
	smaller, razor-sharp talons. Once they choose a foe they continue to attack 
	until that foe is dead. To them, anything that is not an Olthoi is either 
	prey or a potential slave. </font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Like ants and bees, Olthoi come in different 
	forms, each suited to a particular role in their society: </font>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Nymphs </font></b><font size="2">are 
	immature Olthoi. They are relatively weak and easy to kill, but can still 
	slaughter an entire party of inexperienced adventurers. <i><b>Deadly</b></i>
	</font></font></p>
	<font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Workers </font></b><font size="2">are 
	sterile drones, responsible for digging new tunnels and other menial tasks. 
	They are the most common form of Olthoi. <i><b>Lethal</b></i> </font></font>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b><font size="2">Soldiers </font></b><font size="2">
	have but one purpose: to find threats to the hive and destroy them. Their 
	barbed claws can slice through the strongest armor. They can also spit 
	streams of acid. <i><b>Lethal</b></i> </font></font></p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">Two other forms -- <b>Nobles </b>and <b>Queens
	</b>-- are now believed to be extinct. There are always rumors, though, that 
	more still dwell far underground, waiting until the time is right to conquer 
	the surface once again. </font>
