    <td valign="top" width="441"><font face="Arial" size="2">by Eldrin<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="1"><br>
	</font><font size="2" face="Arial">It was midday in Cragstone as Eldrin 
	entered the town. He had just run from Rithwic after a rather exciting 
	battle with Wardiel the Mighty, who had fled the field like a coward when he 
	found that the resistance was too strong. <br>
	<br>
	Eldrin had carefully noted Wardiel's path, and he was guessing that after 
	Rithwic the evil sorcerer would attack either Eastham or Cragstone next. As 
	it happened, Wardiel struck Eastham first, giving Eldrin and many others who 
	had chosen the same path just enough time to reach Cragstone before his 
	arrival. <br>
	<br>
	The evil sorcerer appeared, and before long a substantial group of fighters 
	and mages had gathered around, each hacking at the servant of Bael'Zharon 
	and casting their most powerful spells. Eldrin quickly ran in and tried his 
	blade. When his sword proved to be no match for Wardiel, he turned to his 
	bow and shot a rain of arrows onto his adversary. However, this is where the 
	story takes a dismal turn, for while heroism was in the hearts of many that 
	night, so was treachery. <br>
	<br>
	After loosing another frog crotch arrow, Eldrin paused to reload. It was at 
	that point he was struck from behind, and wounded rather badly. Astounded 
	and thinking some adventurer had misplaced a blow, Eldrin began to turn. He 
	had only moved slightly when the second attack came, leaving him with barely 
	half his health. He spun the rest of the way to find a man named Gal Etah 
	grinning evilly at him. Fearing for his life, Eldrin withdrew hastily from 
	the battle, Gal Etah in hot pursuit. He dodged between the houses, 
	attempting to lose his assailant, but it was not to be. At last, Eldrin 
	ducked into the local tavern and hid under the stairs, hoping to be safe 
	just long enough to regain his health and be able to put up a fight. But as 
	if from nowhere, Gal Etah appeared before him. Eldrin sprang to his feet and 
	tried to escape, but Gal Etah blocked his one way out of the small space he 
	had foolishly placed himself in. Gal Etah struck him once, twice -- and 
	Eldrin crumpled into a heap on the ground, dead. <br>
	<br>
	Fortunately for Eldrin, just minutes before he had bound himself to the 
	local lifestone, where he now appeared. He had the traditional five minutes 
	after death in which he was no longer a player killer, and he used them in 
	the only way he could think of: finding Gal Etah. Before long he had located 
	the murderous coward, who also appeared as a white dot on the compass -- he 
	must have died as well, killed by someone else. &quot;I still have a score to 
	settle&quot; Eldrin told himself, and quietly began to follow his killer around 
	the map, ignoring the battle all around him. Before long he had changed back 
	into a player killer, which meant Gal Etah wasn't far off himself. Eldrin 
	noted the dot turning to red on his compass, and quietly waited for his 
	opportunity. Gal paused and lay down to heal himself after a scrap with 
	another player, at which point Eldrin struck. He had lost his leggings, 
	gloves, sollerets, shield, and sword when he died, leaving him with only his 
	bow and some arrows. He pulled free his bow and let fly an arrow, which 
	struck Gal Etah, who now rose to defend himself. Before long, Eldrin was 
	seriously wounded yet again, and took off at a run. &quot;I'm going about this 
	all wrong...&quot; thought Eldrin. &quot;I was killed through treachery; perhaps I 
	should fight fire with fire.&quot; Eldrin quickly healed his wounds and set out 
	to find his foe. <br>
	<br>
	He quickly located Gal, who was wandering around town, no doubt looking for 
	some other poor soul to murder. Eldrin resisted the urge to let fly a hail 
	of arrows, and quietly stalked his opponent for a good five minutes. He 
	waited cautiously for his opportunity, then spotted it. Gal had engaged 
	another player, who seemed to be putting up a decent fight. Gal Etah was in 
	trouble, and Eldrin vowed to make him pay. Seeing that Gal's health was very 
	low, Eldrin quickly sprang from the bushes and leveled his bow at Gal. He 
	loosed an arrow, which struck Gal square in the back. Gal began to turn to 
	this new threat, but it was already too late. Eldrin quickly nocked another 
	arrow and took aim. He let fly the deadly shaft and watched with grim 
	satisfaction as it struck Gal Etah directly in the head, killing him 
	instantly. Eldrin let out a cry of victory as the murderer fell limply to 
	the ground. <br>
	<br>
	He walked over to the body, which was already being looted by Mortanius, the 
	fellow Gal had been assaulting when Eldrin made his shot. Fearing that 
	Mortanius would be upset that Eldrin had stolen his kill, Eldrin was 
	pleasantly surprised when he complimented him quite civilly on his shot. 
	Eldrin asked if he had found a particularly nice lightning ken on the body, 
	and perhaps a pair of sollerets, but Mort only answered, &quot;No,&quot; before 
	running off to join the battle. Eldrin checked the corpse to see what Mort 
	had left, and was again surprised to find a very nice silver basinet, which 
	he quickly donned. Still depressed at the loss of his items, Eldrin made his 
	way back to the inn where he had been killed. He wove his way around the 
	furniture to the small space behind the stairs and received his third shock 
	as he found all his items still lying on the floor! And not only that, 
	several there had belonged to Gal Etah, who must have been killed quite soon 
	after killing Eldrin. He quickly gathered what he found, and then, a broad 
	smile on his face, he ran back to join the fray. <br>
