    Children of Ispar,<br>
    <br>
    Since the dissolution of Gaerlan's power we have known that he summoned an 
    entity meant to eradicate us. You may also know that Gaerlan had intended to 
    place the essence of that form within me. He failed.<br>
    <br>
    Since leaving the Arcanum to my former student's capable hands, I have 
    continued my efforts to make life on Auberean simpler.<br>
    <br>
    I have provided for you where I can, creating new lifestones, and continuing 
    to garner knowledge of Empyrean culture, to learn why they faltered and 
    ultimately were destroyed.<br>
    <br>
    I have found that Asheron has lied to us several times. There are texts that 
    speak about a being such as the Harbinger, a being that slumbered within the 
    mana streams, a spirit of the land who watched over the most ancient of the 
    Empyrean.<br>
    <br>
    I have also learned that this being, having been removed from the mana 
    streams, is slowly draining the magic from this world. If it is not returned 
    to the place where it was intended to rest, it will ultimately tear this 
    world asunder.<br>
    <br>
    By speaking to Issk you have shown that you are of the character that I 
    require for this task. While I am powerful, I am not able to match the 
    magical prowess that is the mana of this world.<br>
    <br>
    While the Harbinger in it's physical form is relatively weak in comparison 
    to other creatures, its magical essence is potent. It was the reason that 
    Yanshi burned so quickly.<br>
    <br>
    If we are to leave the Harbinger to its own device, in time it will 
    construct a form that can house its indomitable power. When this occurs 
    magic will regress to the strength that most are accustomed too on Ispar.<br>
    <br>
    While this may at first appear as a boon, as the enemies that prowl this 
    land would also be affected, it would mean that the tenacity, and numbers of 
    our enemies would overwhelm us, relegating us to a position of subservience. 
    I will not see that happen.<br>
    <br>
    Issk has been given my permission to enact a rite upon you to grant you 
    greater knowledge into skills that you may possess. He will do so if you 
    agree to assist us, and show the resolve of your pledge by handing a trophy 
    found from the creatures that mar the landscape of Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    I have informed him that the items collected and handed to him should 
    represent a skill. These are the items that I desire and the skill that they 
    will represent to Issk:<br>
    <br>
    Drudge Cabalist Charm = Life Magic<br>
    Banderling Aggressor Scalp = War Magic<br>
    Murk Drudge Charm = Creature Magic<br>
    Insidious Monouga Idol = Item Magic<br>
    Peerless Drudge Charm = Magic Defense<br>
    Olthoi Mutilator Head = Sword<br>
    Telumiat Hollow Minion Mist = Melee Defense<br>
    Savage Banderling Arm = Missile Defense<br>
    Reedshark Reaper Hide = Unarmed Combat<br>
    Olthoi Mutilator Head = Sword<br>
    Banderling Bone Ring = Dagger<br>
    Rendeath Shreth Hide = Axe<br>
    Skeleton Primeval Shin Bone = Mace<br>
    Gauloth Shreth Hide = Spear<br>
    Gloom Drudge Charm = Staff<br>
    Drudge Bloodletter Charm = Bow<br>
    Dark Master Skull = Thrown Weapons<br>
    Banderling Predator Scalp = Crossbow<br>
    Reedshark Slasher Hide = Alchemy<br>
    Plate Armoredillo Hide = Item Tinkering<br>
    Drudge Mystic Charm = Magic Item Tinkering<br>
    Drudge Sage Charm = Armor Tinkering<br>
    Bloodthirsty Monouga Idol = Weapon Tinkering<br>
    Banderling Antagonist Scalp = Cooking<br>
    Banderling Slayer Scalp = Fletching<br>
    Merciless Monouga Idol = Lockpick<br>
    Drudge Ravener Guts = Leadership<br>
    Obsidian Golem Heart = Loyalty<br>
    Wood Golem Heart = Assess Creature<br>
    Ash Gromnie Tooth = Assess Person<br>
    Phantasm Essence = Mana Conversion<br>
    Copper Golem Heart = Jump<br>
    Iron Golem Heart = Run<br>
    Granite Golem Heart = Deception<br>
    Skeleton Hero Skull = Arcane Lore<br>
    <br>
    Once you have chosen the reward that you desire I would ask that you heed 
    Issk's request and enter into the levels beneath the ruined town of Yanshi. 
    I must warn you. There are enemies who lurk there waiting for your entry, 
    desiring to bring you death. The corrupt Virindi, Aerbax, has placed his 
    forces into the tunnels we crafted to gain access to the Harbinger. You will 
    need to be prepared for them.<br>
    <br>
    He has collapsed my portals from within and I can only open them for a short 
    time now.<br>
    <br>
    When you have gained access into the Harbinger's lair you will need to 
    disperse its physical form. When this is done I will summon a portal for 
    you. Use this portal.<br>
    <br>
    Using this portal will allow Issk to see that you have been given my 
    blessing, and have succeeded in the task set before you. Return to him and 
    he shall award with all the knowledge necessary to bring you closer to your 
    fullest potential in whichever skill you choose.<br>
    <br>
    Returning the Harbinger into the mana streams of the world will be a slow 
    process, one that must be done cautiously. I thank you for your efforts in 
    advance. It is through the wisdom and strength of others like you that we 
    shall this aberration returned to where it belongs.<br>
    <br>
    I wish you well,<br>
    <br>
