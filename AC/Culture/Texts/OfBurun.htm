	<font color="#FFFF99">Translator Aun Laokhe tells you, &quot;It appears that the 
	rumors that have been spreading through Elysatah's court could well be 
	true.&quot; </font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Aun Laokhe sighs. </font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Translator Aun Laokhe tells you, &quot;Apparently there has 
	been some activity in the Direlands Swamp in an area once populated heavily 
	by the Mosswarts. The Mosswarts have reached out and asked us for 
	assistance, as you might know. Bleeargh, an emissary that sought out your 
	people recently, went before Elysatah and asked for assistance. She told the 
	Mosswart that they would afford him passage so long as he and his tribe 
	remained peaceful.&quot; <br>
	Translator Aun Laokhe tells you, &quot;I speak of this because many believe that 
	the Mosswart exodus is related to the increase of the Burun, especially in 
	the direlands. I think that it would be better for me to write this down for 
	you.&quot; </font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Translator Aun Laokhe gives you Of the Burun. </font>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Translator Aun Laokhe tells you, &quot;Please, look into 
	this matter for all our sakes. </font><br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Thus far our findings speak to the souring of the land. The mosswarts 
	indigenous to Ezheret-Hazhatu have always been closely tied to the spirits 
	of the land, much like we Tonk. They are not as advanced and their culture 
	lacks the wisdom to heed many of the warnings, but they are driven more by 
	the feelings of the spirit than we are. Often times they have migrated from 
	an area before it became ravaged by storm because they felt the changes more 
	than learned of them. <br>
	<br>
	This supports the idea that the Burun are causing some changes in the world 
	that will bring about some time of ill if they are not stopped. <br>
	<br>
	We have seen what they can do to the world when they press their minds to a 
	cause, evidenced by the alteration in the A'mun desert. What can they do 
	with greater numbers? We can speculate that there are roughly one to two 
	hundred of the creatures presently making the A'mun their home. There are 
	countless others that are making the Blackmire swamp their home and their 
	numbers are growing. <br>
	<br>
	In the Direlands, there has been an increase in the existence of the beasts 
	as well as the types that have been found. Inquisitive Isparians seem to 
	have allowed the latest Burun into the world and as a result we are seeing 
	that the smaller caste of the creatures are now dominating the newly 
	arriving large beasts. If this continues we will undoubtedly face a powerful 
	threat to the world. <br>
	<br>
	We fear for our cousins that have fallen to madness' call. They know not the 
	threat that is presented to the world or to themselves. We must endeavor to 
	stop the incursions and seal these Burun away before they solidify and 
	complete their organization. Otherwise they may prove to be too great a 
	threat. The spirits of the world are restless and they feel the land 
	changing, not for the better. We are in a time of great need. <br>
