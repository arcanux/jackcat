      by Chris L'Etoile as a prize for the Loremasters of Dereth</font></em>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The snow piled upon the
      windowsills and doorsteps of Holtburg. Only the cobblestone roads, salted
      by the shopkeeps, remained patchily clear. Growing mounds of it glittered
      like Milantan emeralds in the evergreen light of enchanted Solstice
      candles. Below, the silver ribbon of the Prosper wound through the frozen
      valley, and above, the clouds gently shook the dust of heaven down.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And I? I was on my tenth
      mead, and fading into a comfortable drowse before the fire in the Helm and
      Shield.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It sounded nice enough when
      the evening began - get together with a few friends, sing the traditional
      Solstice rounds, and reminisce on old times in the highlands. Holtburg had
      a tolerable-large population from the Luparvium Mountains. But as the
      drinks disappeared, the old arguments broke out. Even here, the debate
      over Rellia Taran - whether she was abducted by the Kiraburn chieftain
      Wyrrkrake, or went willingly - is enough to bring the clans to blows. Then
      Daenwulf drunkenly brought up the rumor that the Taran had collaborated
      with Viamont...</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Old arguments still start
      the same old fights, even under different stars. Suffice it to say I was
      sitting on the only unbroken chair in the place.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Right. You there.” A
      stern female voice. That of Wilomine, the proprietor. A young and pretty
      woman, but opening my eyes to properly appreciate her seemed like far too
      much work at the moment.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Fugoff, m’sleepin’,”
      I muttered, snuggling my chin further down into the collar of my Mattekar
      hide coat. There’s nothing like the fur of a smelly mountain beast to
      keep the chill out.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A derisive snort, and I
      found myself pitched forward, chin cracking hard on the floor. “Meerthus!”
      I tried to rub my jaw, but had reached that state of drunkenness where
      everything is a little bit numb, and my fingers had trouble finding it. I
      shook my head to throw the grit and melted ice of the floor out of my
      beard. I got to my hands and knees, and scaled the uneven stonework of the
      hearth to reach my feet.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Yeh great drunken git.
      Drag yer damned bones out of my tavern!” Wilomine held the back of my
      chair in her left hand. The other hand brandished a mace in a way that
      suggested she only sought an excuse to use it. Her grey-blue eyes were
      sunken and bloodshot from the hour and the pipe smoke hazing the rafters.
      The long, ash-blond braid she kept her hair knotted in was slowly coming
      undone, trailing little streamers and arcs across the shoulder of her
      padded leather jerkin.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Normally, I find it hard to
      resist the charm of a beautiful young lowland woman cursing and
      threatening to bash my skull. In this case, I thought it likely that the
      mead would dampen my already meager charm.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Right, right,” I said,
      stumbling vaguely towards the door. “Just give me a minute to- oof!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A slam, the shunt of a
      thrown bolt, and I found myself on my face in the snow. My rump hurt.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Damnation,” I
      muttered, picking myself off the ground again. I promised myself I’d
      come back and woo the charming Wilomine when drunken highlanders hadn’t
      just ransacked her pub.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Time to go home, if the
      low-slung orb of the red moon had anything to say about it. I lurched
      forward two steps, and it took me all of that long to realize that my
      meads wanted out. I chuffed through the thickening drifts into the alley
      between the Helm and Shield and Fispur’s Foodstuffs, turned the face the
      wall of the pub where the snow was yellow, and unlaced my breeches. The
      world tilted a little, and I laid a hand on the tavern’s wall, leaning
      to steady myself. I hoped it didn’t take too long. I was a-feared of the
      cold harming something I hoped to introduce the barkeep to someday.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I thought I was making an
      unusual amount of noise. I peered down to make sure there was no blood - I
      had been punched a few times in the stomach, after all. Nothing. As things
      trickled to a halt, I noticed there were still some snuffling noises
      coming from behind the corner of the grocer’s.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A Drudge. Had to be. Three
      of them, sounded like, or I was a cow-herder’s son. They must have come
      into town to find shelter from the snows.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I hurriedly laced my
      breeches up again, muttering curses against the uncertain ancestry of the
      war party I would soon face. “Think to come into our homes when it’s
      cold, eh?” I growled, struggling with my breeches.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Damn it! Knot in the laces.
      My mead-thickened fingers fumbled with the rawhide. Looking up at where
      the noises were coming from, I called, “Think to disturb Wilomine,
      aye?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I hoped this Drudge army
      was patient. I could just picture them, dozens of the mewing things,
      gathering on the outskirts of Holtburg. I’d bet the crest of the hill
      was covered with a hundred of them already, and Brendan the Advocate was
      wandering dizzily around the West Outpost Lifestone. Ah, there…</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Come out!” I roared,
      hands scrabbling for the pommel of my sword. I stormed down the alley, my
      broadsword wiggling in the air before me, kicking up billows of loose snow
      that skirled away on the wind. “I’ll give yeh whafer- damnation!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I turned the corner to see
      a small girl, perhaps of eight summers, curled up against the wall of the
      grocery. </font>
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#6B6B6B">EpiK SUCKS</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Shut yer bunghole, yeh
      damned drunk!” Wilomine’s voice pounded through the wall behind me.
      “I’ll come out there and brain yeh!”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ah, me. The old ways are
      lost. Here all the women are highland women. I remember the days when the
      clans would go a-raiding, swooping down on some poor lowland village to
      steal the cattle and ravish the milkmaids. Or vice-versa. We loved our
      mead then too, I do confess. And I do miss the occasional smell of Viamont
      rosewater on the wenches…</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Who are you, then?” I
      asked the girl. She looked up at me with swollen, frightened eyes, and
      began to puff with sobs. Her river-blue eyes scrunched up, and she buried
      her face in the threadbare knees of her frock, cowering away from me.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ach, too gruff. Idiot.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Sorry. Ah... Sorry.” I
      fumbled my sword back into its sheath, missing twice, and dropped to my
      knees beside her. “I’m not gonna hurt ye lass, I’m just dru- tired.
      What’s your name?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She peeked around her elbow
      at me. “Calanna,” she said.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Right, good. Got her name.
      That’s good. That’s progress, so it is. Her dirt-smudged cheeks slid
      out from behind her knees and she sniffled loudly, exhaling a ragged trail
      of cloud.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She wants me to say
      something. Ah, Solvus Mother, what do you say to a frightened child?
      Pretend she’s Wilomine, you daft idiot. “That’s a pretty name,” I
      ventured, watching for tears like a wary mouse watches for a cat’s
      opening eye. “Like the lowland flower?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Uh-huh.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, that went well.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“You don’ talk much,
      eh?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She giggled through
      chattering teeth, and wrapped her arms tightly around her knees.
      Wonderful, success. Except this girl was in a light cotton frock, in the
      first snowfall known to Dereth. I noticed small flowers woven into her
      chestnut ringlets; young lavender-and-white calanna blossoms, shriveling
      in the cold.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“What are you doing
      here?” I asked her, swaying slightly. “Where are your parents?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I don’t know. I was
      going to fetch wood for the fire…” Fresh tears rolled down her
      flushed-apple cheeks, and the brave little face collapsed in on itself.
      “It was so pretty…” she sobbed.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ah. The picture flashed
      into my mind; the girl tarrying alone in the woods, chasing squirrels or
      picking berries, when a gossamer violet swirl blossoms before her. Another
      portal orphan arrives in Dereth. Thank you, Lord Asheron. Surely, your
      wisdom and beneficence know no bounds.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Don’t cry, lass,” I
      muttered, shrugging out of my coat. “Here.” I delicately dropped the
      gray mattekar fur around her little shoulders, and white fingers flickered
      out to pull it tight and closed around her.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“This smells bad,” her
      watery voice said, from somewhere in its bulk.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I grinned despite myself.
      “I guess ye’re not a farmgirl then, eh?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“No, sir. Father...”
      she drew a breath, forestalling another flood of tears. “Father is a
      woodsman.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Ah, well ye’re in the
      right town then, lass. Holtburg is a forester’s town - built to work the
      Tiofor Wood yonder.” I waved a mead-floppy hand towards the northwest.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I’ve never... heard of
      Holtburg,” she said, eyes glistening.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Aye, well... Come along.
      I’ll get yeh out of these snows.” I started to get up, wavered
      off-balance, and steadied. I reached down to give her a hand up. She took
      it, but didn’t let go once on her feet. Holding her hand, I guided her
      up the hill to the advocate spire.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Calanna made a small noise
      of surprise as we cleared the scribe’s. I glanced down, saw her saucer
      eyes, and looked up at the spire again. “It’s pretty,” she said. The
      high spikes of the roof illuminated the snow on the ground and the tree
      branches with warm orange light.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Aye. I guess it is, at
      that.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We trudged up to the door,
      kicked the snow off our boots, and went inside.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Oh!” she said,
      blinking around the room. “It’s warm in here.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brendan, sitting in the
      central column, looked up from a book. “Can I help you two?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“She just arrived here,
      Brendan.” Lowering my voice and leaning across the counter, I added,
      “Alone.” A pained look crossed his face, and he swung out of his chair
      and his little room. I could see his aegis on the bookshelf in the little
      room, endlessly orbited by a fairy-swirl of luminous sea-green dustballs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“It’s always warm in a
      spire,” he said, with false cheer. “Or cool when it’s warm outside.
      Really, it stays the same all the time within the walls. One of the magics
      of the Empyrean, we expect.” He was appraising her with the eye of a
      practiced healer. “What’s your name?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Calanna,” she said,
      looking away with sudden modesty. Well, Brendan was rather a handsome man,
      or so the ladies told me. “Who are the Empeerin?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He leaned close to me and
      said, “She looks fine. You got her out of the cold quick - good man.”
      I decided not to mention that I’d only chanced upon her while painting
      the snow. “Has she used the Stone?” I shrugged. “The Em-pie-ree-an,”
      he told her, carefully. “The people who used to live here. They made the
      spire.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“They made it warm?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Yes.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“And bright?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“You mean the spire
      lights? Yes, indeed.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“They must be nice,”
      she said, with all the wisdom of a child.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I sighed, thinking of how
      she had come to be here, and Brendan spared me a glare. Right. I looked at
      my boots. There’d be plenty of time to tell her of the one Empyrean we
      had ever met.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Calanna, I’m going to
      go get a friend of mine, another Advocate. Her name’s Zell. She’ll
      have a bed made up for you, so you can sleep tonight. Is that all
      right?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I want to go home,”
      Calanna said, plaintively.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brendan smiled, but his
      eyes were pained. He too had arrived as a child alone, when the Olthoi
      still ruled. He still forswore the use of magic, and walked rather than
      use a portal. “For tonight, at least. We’ll see about getting you home
      tomorrow, aye?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“All right.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brendan stood and turned to
      me. “Stay here with her. I’m going to roust Zellie. Maybe she’ll be
      able to heat some food up for her too.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Ah, Brendan... what
      should I do with her?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Do with her?” he
      asked, looking at me as if I had three heads. “Tell her a story, yeh
      dumb highland brute! And for the love of the Mothers, chew a mint leaf.
      You smell like an alehouse.” He cinched his robe tight and stepped out
      into the storm.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I looked down at the girl.
      She looked up at me.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“So. Erh...” I
      scratched my head. “Have you heard the one about the Aluvian enchantress
      and the Gharu’n swordsman’s war stallion?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“No.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I paused. The blossoms in
      her hair had perked up again in the warmth of the spire, releasing a
      lightest breath of mountain-vale scent. “Well, good!” I said,
      reluctantly. “Yeh shouldn’t have, at your age. You know the story of
      the Frost King, aye?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Yes.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Want to hear it again?
      It’s good weather for it.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Yes.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Right. Have a seat on
      the stairs, there, lass. Let me see if I can remember the way my mother
      told me...”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the far, far north,
      where the ground is forever besnowed and the sea-ice lays so thick that
      men may build houses upon it, there lies a great palace of silver-blue
      ice. It has no name that men speak, though some say that long ago it held
      as many titles as there are dreams. Its walls are the height of mountains,
      and the width of the great, slow Canfeld, measured one bank to another.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Yet for all their size, you
      can see clear through them. The slightest luminance of sun or moon is
      caught within their facets, and sets them all alight. It is said the walls
      can be seen for a hundred leagues, sparkling on the horizon. By day they
      shimmer warm gold; at twilight they blaze like the crimson stars the
      Gharu’n revere; by moonlight, they burn with the bone-pale fire of snow
      falling on pines.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lofty and proud is this
      palace of Borimel, King of Frost and Keeper of the North Wind. His task is
      to loose snow upon the world. Long ages has he kept his appointed task,
      and diligently measured out the frosts and squalls each year, lest a chain
      of heavy weather crush the trees of the forest and the cities of men.
      Borimel was in the world before us, and given his task by our Blessed
      Mothers themselves: the Three-as-One who observe us from the shadows of
      every dream (where we are more ourselves than in waking hours), and sing
      wisdom in the secret heart of every woman.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Few have reached his
      marvelous walls, for they sit upon the backs of the great Garannic
      Mountains. High they are, beyond any other peaks of Ispar. Lendramm, a
      seer of Celdon, claimed that they actually meet the sky, and from Garannic,
      one may walk out among the stars. Perhaps Borimel wanders thus. Often
      enough a bright streak of light jets across the heavens. “Borimel is
      throwing snowballs at the moon again,” the elders say.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Frost King is a giant
      man, the size of a great northern bear. His eyes are the vein-blue of
      frozen lakes, and his hair white as hoarfrost. As he performs his work he
      wears a great, stormcloud-grey cloak. The key to the Gates of the North
      Wind hangs from his neck, held by a heavy chain of cold iron. On the days
      when his duty calls, he slings the cloak around his broad shoulders, and
      walks through the silver gates set in his walls. He walks - none know how
      far - to the Gates of the North Wind.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some say Borimel lives
      alone-</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Isn’t the Frost King
      married to the Winter Queen?” Calanna interrupted.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“No, the Winter Queen
      was-” I just barely stopped myself from saying “a real person.”
      “...Alfrega,, a queen of Aluvia. She was called the Winter Queen because
      of the paleness of her skin, and because of her cruelty.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She blinked, accepting this
      without question.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Right. Where was I...”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some say Borimel lives
      alone. Others say a legion of frost creatures serve him faithfully,
      guarding his stupendous walls from intrusion and keeping the Gates of the
      North Wind sealed during the summer months.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On the darkest nights of
      the first winter of the world, Borimel, keen-eyed beyond measure, looked
      out from his towers. He looked beyond the flashing walls of his lonely
      citadel, and his eye rested upon the small hovels of men in the south. He
      saw then that they were cold and frightened. The nights were terrible
      long, and growing longer, and all their hopes faded. Some whispered the
      sun was being swallowed by a great beast; others that our Blessed Mothers
      had turned their backs.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But Borimel, being a
      creature more of the land than we, knew the truth. The long nights and
      bitter cold were merely the dreamtime of the world. As we must rest from
      time to time, so must the earth. It has long been known that the fruit
      grown in the same field year after year loses its flavor.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Frost King saw the fear
      of the people, and, being a kindly man, resolved to do what he could to
      cheer them. He could not keep the tempests from being loosed - for that
      was his duty to our Mothers. He searched his palace high and low, seeking
      some boon he could give to men. But he is a creature of simple tastes; he
      has little but his bed, chair, and table.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At last, at his wits’
      end, he sat as his chair, and put his feet upon his table, and he watched
      the colors of sunset play through his walls of ice. Then he realized what
      to do.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Calling forth the powers
      entrusted to him by our Mothers, he changed the walls of his palace,
      bending and shifting them, until their light was directed towards the sky.
      Sheets of fire appeared in the north, and men cowered in fear. But when no
      evil came of the lights, they stood again, and looked in wonder; for it
      was as if beautiful ribbons had been loosed to dance across the stars, and
      the nights did not seem as dark as they had.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This, then, is the truth of
      the sky-banners; the Frost King keeps his duty, and is stern and
      unswerving. The storms of winter will come as they must, and the earth
      shall dream of spring. But Borimel thinks of us always in his palace of
      ice, and bends the light of the sun and moon so we may be warmed in heart.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">* * *</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Is he real?” Calanna
      whispered, eyes shining in the candlelight. “Does the King exist? Is
      there a magic castle in the north?”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I looked into her wide
      eyes, clear water splashed with the foam from a falls. No lying to this
      one. “Come along,” I said, and stepped up onto the stairs that wrapped
      around the central column of the spire. I reached down and offered her my
      hand. Little pink fingers tried to wrap themselves around my callused
      hands. I lead her upwards.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The instant we passed the
      threshold of the roof entrance, the chill descended. It’s quite odd
      having your face and shoulders swirled in snow, but your feet pleasantly
      warm. The magics found here are strange and subtle. Buildings maintain a
      constant temperature despite the weather. Paper made of crushed flower
      petals remains intact and sweet-smelling after thousands of years. Columns
      whisper in dead languages to stones that wait patiently for untold
      millenia. Massive, seamless towers hum with power and throw light upon the
      waves below.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And, looming above our
      heads, tall spikes reached to the sky, throwing tawny light down from no
      source at all to highlight the swirling snow.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“Here, Calanna.” I
      picked her up, grunting a little at the weight. She wasn’t as Silveran
      as she looked. I held her away from my chest. “Look up.” She did, and
      gasped.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I looked up too. The snow.
      Spiraling and floating, falling lazily down around us like falling stars
      in the spire-light. I spun slowly around as we looked up. So many motes of
      white. Luminous constellations came at us in endless numbers and variety,
      blew past, and more followed. Ribbons of auroral light rippled and blazed
      behind them.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“I’m dizzy,” she said
      breathlessly, swaying and stretching out her arms like a young sparrow’s
      wings. “It feels like flying.”</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“This world has its own
      magic,” I whispered into her hair. “It doesn’t abide at any one
      compass point. It’s in the ground, and in the air. Every breath you take
      is charged with it. It wraps itself around you when you sleep. It becomes
      you. Here, we’re all magic.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">“This is the Frost
      King’s realm.”</font></td>
