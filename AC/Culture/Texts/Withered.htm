      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To whomever may find this:</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If I am addressing a reader of my previous
      note, then I must heartily apologize for the uncertain state of affairs I
      left you in leagues away in a small dungeon many miles west of Sawato. I
      hope you will understand that I had to let the demands of the moment
      outweigh the normal priorities of civilized discourse.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having hundreds of Banderlings running
      towards you, waving large and heavy objects menacingly in your direction,
      while at the same time being surrounded by only slightly more friendly
      Mosswarts, many of whom are holding long pointed sticks close to delicate
      parts of your body, and then adding to this: you and your Mosswart
      companions (Indeed, it is a forced companionship, but I look for whatever
      signs of civility as I can) are sprinting away from these bloodthirsty
      Banderlings, none of this makes for a composed and fit state of mind
      capable of producing the tone of writing of which I would normally
      attempt.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For all you readers who may have not had
      the pleasure of reading my previous small travelogue, a pithy recap
      follows: I was captured by a group of Mosswarts. We were then set upon a
      group of Banderlings intent on doing us harm. The Mosswarts apparently
      managed to kill the attacking Banderlings, although at grievous harm to
      themselves. I had thought everything had quieted down, when a new and even
      larger group of Banderlings were sighted to the east of us and approaching
      us fast. The Mosswart leader immediately shouted out a string of orders,
      and I noticed a sizeable contingent of some of the smaller
      Mosswarts making their way west individually in small groups. Being
      temporarily an object of no one's attention, I used this time to sprint
      into the dungeon portal, where I made my way to my holding cell, where I
      had left my note for some brave adventurer to find and get back into the
      hands of the Society. I quickly added most of my postscript before two of
      the more ferocious Mosswart guards burst into the room and absconded with
      me once more.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Trust me, it felt as frenetic as it sounds.
      At least my note remains back in the old Mosswart Dungeon. Unless a
      Banderling ate it.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">West and west the Mosswarts and I headed,
      through swamp and forest and then surrounded by mountainous peaks as we
      crept and snuck and ran through the deep brown valleys. Running. Always
      running. I had liked to think that I was in a shape befitting an active
      Explorer of the Society. These Mosswarts disabused me of that notion.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The near constant physical exertion, almost
      to the point of exhaustion, left me unable to truly ponder the
      circumstances of recent events.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was only when we reached the desert that
      I was able to turn my attention to what had been transpiring. We had
      finally either lost our Banderling pursuers or they had given up. Here was
      the first issue of note. In all of my wanderings in Dereth, never had I
      seen Banderlings pursue their quarry for such a long distance or period of
      time.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many hours and miles passed beneath our
      feet, and yet step for step was matched by our pursuers for most of the
      way. What desire lurked beneath those misshapen bodies to fuel such
      effort?</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">And why such enmity in the first place?
      Never had I heard of such interspecies conflict before. While I had heard
      the same rumors as most of the Society that the Banderlings and Mosswarts
      had come from the same place before they were transported here, rumors so
      widely spoken that almost all assumed they were true, I never considered
      that perhaps they were mortal enemies back in that long distant homeland.
      And yet if they did have such bloodlust towards each other, would we not
      have seen it before this?</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was only when we reached the Maze that
      some of these answers began to take shape. How to describe this miserable
      place? When I was a boy, long before I could have ever have dreamed of
      being whisked away to a strange time and place, bereft of most whom I
      loved and cared for...again, I apologize, such moments occasionally
      overcome me. I'll speak no more of it.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">When I was a boy, I used to play with
      certain types of puzzles, long drawn out maps of lines, written on
      parchment, arranged in such a way that it was almost impossible to figure
      out how to traverse from beginning to end of the labyrinth. When I was a
      boy I think I had some skill in such matters. I wish I was that boy again.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">I can make neither north nor south of this
      hell. Twisty curves leading back upon one another up and down turning
      round and round like an inscrutable sentence with neither beginning nor
      ending that makes its readers cry out in agony to end the pain, the
      interminable pain. That is the essence of this Maze. Luckily, my party
      does not rely upon me for guidance through the dungeon. Not only do
      Mosswarts have a superb sense of smell, but apparently they do not have to
      rely on any of the known senses of man to find their way through madness.
      At least this is how it seems to me.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">But I talked of answers, not so long ago,
      and while I know nothing for sure, here is what I can guess. When we came
      to the Maze, I was surprised to see that there was already a small party
      of Mosswarts waiting for us. And they were holding a huge rock. What this
      rock's purpose is, or where it had come from I had no idea. But when our
      groups combined the Mosswarts held up the rock in triumph, even though it
      took ten of them to do it. And those Mosswarts who had taken Banderling
      scalps now threw them up in the air, and there was much shouting and
      rejoicing.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Afterwards, the Mosswart leader then drew
      out of his pack a large piece of strangely colored green cloth. It
      glistened in the sun, as if covered by some oily substance. Upon the cloth
      was a faint image of a Mosswart. As he brought it out the Mosswarts turned
      immediately silent, and bowed in the direction of the cloth. He then
      proceeded to put it back in his pack, and the entire group proceeded to
      enter the Maze.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Obviously the cloth is some kind of token
      for these Mosswarts, of what kind I could not say. But it has apparently
      immense importance for them.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps the rock has some sort of similar
      importance for the Banderlings. I wish I knew more about them, but if you
      receive this note than please try to find a Olivier Rognath, who resides
      in Eastham, on the eastern coast of Dereth. While he is not a full fledged
      Explorer in the Society, he has been a close ally to our purposes. He is
      also far more knowledgeable about Banderlings than I am, although of
      course even experts on our new neighbors know little.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">But if you find this note, and its brother,
      please journey there to see him. Maybe he can shed some light on what has
      been transpiring here.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Olivier -- My own idle speculations lead me
      to believe that some kind of religious conflict or worse is taking place
      among these two cousin races. How or why it started I have no idea, and
      how it ties into these random rumors of Mosswarts moving west I remain
      likewise in the dark.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please forward this to the Society as soon
      as possible. I look forward to sitting in front of a fireplace telling you
      these harrowing stories in person.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sincerely,</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Candeth Martine</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And yet another impromptu addition: We are
      moving again. Apparently some of the Mosswarts had been moving the stone
      into the deepest caverns of the Maze when they were set upon by forces
      unknown and unseen. When we came across their mangled and shredded bodies
      the stone was nowhere to be found. I have been thrown into another cell,
      watched over by two guards, but they have not interrupted my writing.
      Hearing all the commotion outside, I have decided to guess they are making
      preparations to leave. I assume I will be a part of that process.</font></td>
