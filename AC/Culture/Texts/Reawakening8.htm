          <font face="Arial" size="2">Hendac and Jenavere arrived at the castle 
          an hour after the summons. They had expected the news to be grim, as 
          the last time they had seen Elysa she was feverish and breathing too 
          shallowly to last for much longer. Yet the letter they had received 
          was signed in her hand and sealed with her seal. They hoped, beyond 
          hope, that she was awake.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          guards let them pass without trouble. They knew them on sight now and 
          were under orders to allow them passage into the castle. Hendac wore a 
          bright beaming smile upon his face, and the cold winter air had made 
          his nose and cheeks turn a rosy red. Jenavere, while sharing her 
          companion’s elation, wore her ever-present scowl.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Within the castle courtyard, Elysa 
          waited with Antius. Jenavere saluted the High Queen and took a step 
          forward. The two laughed and embraced. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“None the worse for wear, I see.” 
          Jenavere quipped.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Better, I’d say.” Elysa smiled 
          genuinely and clapped the woman on the back. Hendac knelt before the 
          High Queen. Elysa cuffed his ear. “Stand up. I’m not about to give you 
          accolades of knighthood.” Hendac rubbed his ear and smiled up at her. 
          He shrugged and looked at Antius.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Don’t look at me, I told you not to do 
          it,” he chuckled.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Borelean?” Jenavere asked.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Inside, lessons with Asheron.” Elysa 
          pulled Hendac to his feet and wrapped an arm over his shoulder, then 
          placed the other around Jenavere. “I hear that it was the two of you 
          who found the Olthoi Queen’s hive.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Hendac did,” Jenavere stated as they 
          walked to a pair of benches where new fallen snow had been cleared 
          away and a small fire burned to warm them. “I just poked around a 
          bit.” Hendac made a few hand motions to make it clear that Jenavere 
          was being modest and sat on one of the benches. He warmed his hands 
          over the coals and continued to smile.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Either way, you found it first…you’re 
          the best Olthoi hunters I’ve ever known.” Elysa sat beside Antius on a 
          bench opposite Jenavere and Hendac. “It’s why I need you to check on 
          something for me.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What’s that?” Jenavere asked as Hendac 
          produced four ripe apples from within a pouch. He handed them out and 
          happily crunched into his own. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I’ve been given a report by one of my 
          guards that there was a rumbling felt heading south beneath 
          Lytelthrope. We know with absolute certainty that Nuhmudira failed to 
          kill the Olthoi Queen. We’ve got to find out if the Queen is still 
          here on Dereth. If she is, then I need to organize an assault and we 
          have to kill her.” Elysa reached toward Antius. He produced a small 
          scrap of parchment and handed it to her. “This is the location.” She 
          handed the map to Hendac. He popped the apple between his teeth and 
          wiped his hands on his leather pants. “I’ve dispatched one guard to 
          the area for the moment. No need to arouse anyone’s suspicion. 
          Besides, the longer I can go without too many people knowing that I am 
          awake the better my chances are at finding out who tried to kill me.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You want to know what I think?” 
          Jenavere asked. Antius shook his head.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I’ve been over it with her, Jenavere. 
          She woke up more stubborn than ever.” </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Stubborn? Perhaps…but also cannier. 
          I’m not about to make accusations of anyone. I know enough about what 
          happened and I’ve taken steps to ensure that this place will be safe 
          against such an attack again.” She slipped her hand into Antius’. 
          “I’ll wait for proof, and then when I have it I’ll make my move 
          against <i>whoever </i>made the attempt.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I don’t envy you Elysa,” Jenavere said 
          and bit into her apple.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Why is that?”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“You’ve earned the ire of some 
          individuals who see you as standing in the way of their life goals. 
          You’re too good a person to call them out, and too strong a person to 
          let them kill you.” She shrugged. “I don’t envy the position you’re in 
          at all. You’ve got to handle the Aluvians, Sho and Gharu’ndim…it’s 
          more than Pwyll ever did.”</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius took a bite of the apple, and 
          looked at Hendac who was busy plopping apple seeds onto the snow and 
          stamping them down. Elysa let his hand drop away and leaned toward 
          Jenavere.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Aye. It is a difficult position that I 
          find myself in, but it’s a position that I created for myself. I let 
          the people who built our cities and towns place me here, and somewhere 
          along the way I lost sight of those people. I lost sight of the reason 
          that they followed me.” She shook her head. “When he was alive, 
          Thorsten used to say that I was the strongest woman he had ever met. 
          When I was lying in my room, poison coursing through my veins, all I 
          could think about was waking up. That is my strength.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I don’t expect that it will be easy to 
          win them back. I don’t possess the wealth of magic that Nuhmudira 
          does. But I will not stand idly by and see the witch continue to draw 
          more of the good and decent people who live here to her banner. I will 
          not see them slowly bent to her will nor will I see them suffer. 
          No…I’ve been away for too long. The time has come for strength and for 
          leadership…and I shall lead.”</font></div>
