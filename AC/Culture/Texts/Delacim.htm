    Mournful disaster struck as we breached the world of those things. We have 
    catalogued them as Olthoi in our libraries, and the warden shall be informed 
    of their existence. But my heart shall never recover. <br>
    <br>
    For more than 1700 years I have lived upon this world, mindful of the burden 
    that every man and woman carries throughout their lives. Their days are 
    filled with the wonder of learning and splendor that has been the Cerulean 
    throne now since the Darkness was repelled and the Council of Five gave 
    their lives for all, but these people have not seen the spread of time. They 
    have not watched as those whom they new as children grew old and passed away 
    to the dust from whence they were born. <br>
    <br>
    Now my prodigy is dead. A victim of a hostile world the likes of which my 
    wards could not comprehend or warn. A world that teemed with virulent life 
    that choked the very sun from the sky and poisoned the air with a scent of 
    fruit set to long in the summer heat. <br>
    <br>
    Delacim is dead. His brother has used his position to levy the Emperor to 
    force further expeditions to this world despite my trepidation and staunch 
    objection. They will conduct their surveys and collection regardless of my 
    aid, and I cannot allow the sole responsibility of summoning fall to Gaerlan. 
    His mind is not open enough to comprehend the nuances of the planar flux, so 
    it must be my hand that the portals to the Olthoi homeworld are made. <br>
    <br>
    Knorr will become a facility to test these monstrosities in the depths of 
    the Lyceum scholars sent by the Emperor shall prod the creatures and learn 
    what makes them resistant to our magics. Unlike the Tonk these creatures are 
    horrors, incapable of communication away from their masters. In a sense they 
    remind me of Gaerlan, unfaceted, flat, base and depraved with a sense only 
    for survival, at all costs. (Translator's note: This line was scratched over 
    once as though to be stricken. Personally I agree with Asheron here.) <br>
    <br>
    These events were cloaked from me, and so I think that all the ages that 
    shall come hence will be forever altered. I wonder if this is the beginning 
    of the Darkness' next sending, is this my next test? <br>
    <br>
    Delacim was my hope. Now he is gone. I, the servant of the Light, am alone 
    to bear the weight again.<br>
