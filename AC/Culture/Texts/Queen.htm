    <br>
    She pushed aside the velvet curtain and stepped out onto the balcony. Dawn 
    peeked out over the horizon, wispy and shy. Although she could not relax the 
    clench in her hands, she closed her eyes, pressing her face against the 
    gentle wind. <i>To relax is not to surrender. </i>The words themselves 
    rarely soothed, but thinking of Asheron's gentle face as he said them did. 
    Her flaxen hair twisted in the light breeze. The feeling harkened her back 
    to the time before Dereth, when she was an adventurous girl on Ispar. She 
    stretched her arms wide and relished the memory for as long as she dared.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Had life ever been that simple? Such times 
    now seemed a half-remembered dream. It scared her to think how quickly 
    memory changed, how frail the strands of one's life truly were. What else 
    would she forget over time? Asheron had long ago proven himself to be 
    fallible. She opened her eyes and stared out over the rolling green hills, 
    stained now by bright oranges, dull purples, and earthen yellows. Autumn had 
    arrived nearly overnight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It had been almost a year since she had last 
    been amongst the people, the fateful night that the Hopeslayer's Thorns had 
    sought to slake his vengeance. The night Arwic died. She pressed her hands 
    down upon the balustrade, took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She hated this feeling. Yet every year at 
    this time it returned. A bright day containing much to celebrate and enjoy, 
    and she could only think of the things undone, the problems still to be 
    faced. There was some consolation in being alone. Her guards stood without 
    the chamber and would not bother her, unless a matter of importance arose. 
    She gritted her teeth. She knew that she must make a journey today, and the 
    thought of it pained her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From within the chamber she heard a soft cry. 
    Her son. She wiped away the tears and smoothed her cotton smock, her bare 
    feet padding softly on the stones beyond the curtains. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He was still sleeping, caught in the throes 
    of a dream. His face, more like hers than his Thorsten's, shone bright with 
    a gentle smile. She sat beside him and ran her hand gently over his dirty 
    blond locks. He shifted toward her. This brought a smile to her lips, ever 
    so brief. She leaned down and kissed his forehead before rising and crossing 
    the chamber to the doors. Behind her came a vague mutter--reflexive 
    adolescent annoyance--and the sound of sheets being pulled over wild hair.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The day had just begun. Borelean would sleep 
    for another hour, perhaps two. She had time to deal with other matters 
    before taking on the role of mother. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She opened the door gently so as to not stir 
    the sleeping Prince and stepped out into the hall. The guards, a pair of 
    glittering, white crystal monoliths, turned to inspect her. Pure 
    affectation, she knew. The eyes etched upon their faces were decorative. 
    They did not see with such fallible human organs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“See that he is not disturbed,” she 
    commanded. “If he awakens tell him I will return shortly.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The pillar across the hall--like the Golems, 
    a gift from Asheron--glowed, and faint, foreign whispers floated on the 
    still, indigo air. The Diamond Golems bowed in unison, making a noise like a 
    small avalanche. She winced. Fearsome, yes, but not the best choice for 
    protecting sleepy children. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">He'd meant well. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She strode through the halls of the keep 
    without meeting the eyes of any of the human guards. They bowed as she 
    approached and she dismissed each such action with a wave of her hand. Her 
    chin settled further with each one, her shoulders drawing closer together. 
    This was not what she had foreseen when hobbling out of the bloody darkness, 
    her body bearing the weight of a cold mountain of a man, a warm mote of a 
    boy, and uncounted tears. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">How could she rule those that she could no 
    longer identify with? Already in the cloisters of the Arcanum, acrimonious 
    scholars railed against her return. “Strange wizards hiding away in towers 
    distributing arrows is no way to inherit the divine right of kings!” Her 
    cheeks burned at the words, her teeth set, her hands clutched at a bow that 
    wasn't there. <i>The damned nobles. So what if I'm not blueblood? </i>She 
    darkly mused over the choices as she stalked through the marble halls.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira's plan had worked. Isparians were 
    purchasing their homes and wares to place within at a pace far greater than 
    the carpenters could match. Yet the Monster of the Labyrinth had perfected 
    her art and continued the flawless execution of placing <i>The Keepers</i>. 
    She was capable, ardent, and knowledgeable. Yet Nuhmudira was more out of 
    touch than Elysa. Her obsession grew with each day, dark stains on her soul 
    that pulled apart her sanity. In time her hatred of the Empyrean and drive 
    to harness their magic would be her undoing. One could not rule through 
    paranoia. No, better for Nuhmidira to remain her vizier, and one kept at 
    arm's length, lest Elysa find herself a fly within the spider's den. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Celdiseth, another of the Archmages, was a 
    hermit by choice. He was also a poor choice for a leader. He was a potent 
    speaker and perhaps the most intelligent of her council but too often his 
    study and teaching of the School of the Arm led him to think of destruction 
    before mediation. She chuckled and bit her lower lip. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jaleh al-Thani, a noble man by birth, with an 
    ignoble heart. His eyes saw the world as profit to be made. He was no 
    leader. He was a privateer, sure as any Viamontian Sea-Captain or other 
    rake, willing to sell his mother for pyreal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>What a menagerie we are</i>, she thought.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She approached her own bedchamber and pushed 
    the doors open, paying no heed to the rumbling crystals that aped a human 
    bow as she passed, a pair for each of them at Asheron's insistence. Her 
    guards scorned them, but they were used to fighting ones weakened by 
    centuries of neglect. The nobles, of course, whispered that it was just like 
    the absent queen, relying on Empyrean magic over her own people. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ya damned old fools,” she muttered, 
    irritation bringing the highland back to her voice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Swinging the doors closed, she made her way 
    to the stand where her armor and bow rested. They had been placed down, she 
    had hoped, for the last time after the Hopeslayer fell. She shook her head 
    and listened to the birds cooing in the distance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Simple.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Young sunlight blushed the room as autumn 
    wind brushed aside her curtains. It filtered into the room and struck the 
    carapace armor. The dark purple devoured the light. Her brow furrowed as a 
    chill ran down her spine. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A clatter of iron boots on stone sounded in 
    the corridor outside. It was her guardsmen and someone else, steps lighter, 
    unrecognizable. The chill came again, something was wrong. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She strode toward the door and met the group 
    as it opened. Three men entered and bowed their heads. Two she recognized 
    immediately as members of her Royal Guard. The third, dressed in deep blues, 
    eyeing the Golems with considerable suspicion, was unfamiliar. She knew she 
    had seen him once or twice before. The guards bowed their heads as she 
    approached. The man took a knee. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Queen Strathelar, this is--” the guard began 
    only to be cut off by his queen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius Blackmoor,” she stated 
    matter-of-factly, remembering his name. “What brings the warrior-scholar to 
    my keep?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The guards lifted their heads and stood at 
    attention. Antius, light brown hair damp with sweat, remained on a knee as 
    he spoke. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Queen Strathelar--” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Her gut twisted as he presented the back of 
    his neck. “Come sit down,” she said briskly. “You look as though you've had 
    a hard journey.” She looked to the guards. “Bring me Viamont toast and 
    juice.” She dismissed them with a nod and motioned to the chairs flanking a 
    table near the window. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I am sorry Your Majesty--” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elysa,” she stated plainly, her voice 
    brooking no argument. “We are two people having a conversation, please.” The 
    chair scraped along the stone floor as she pulled it out and sat. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius followed suit, obviously unused to 
    such candor from one of Elysa's station. He freed his pack and set it on the 
    floor with a soft groan. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Now, what have you come to speak to me 
    about?” Elysa asked as she studied the man across the table. His features 
    were softer than most Aluvians, lacking the angular cheekbones and thin 
    nose. His eyes, however, were piercing blue, like the haze left in the wake 
    of lightning across the sky. He was nearing his middle years, and was in his 
    own right accomplished. He had been a student of the sword that became 
    enamored by the call of the Library in Cragstone. Celdisith had told her of 
    him on several occasions. He was a student of the Heart under Fadsahil al-Tashbi's 
    tutelage and showed “a great predilection toward gathering knowledge.” She 
    had met him sometime before the Thorns. He was older now, but time had not 
    hardened him, nor taken the whimsical look from his eye. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the moment, however, his face was creased 
    with worry. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I have just come from Marae Lassel,” he 
    began. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She was aware of the portals that had 
    appeared. She was also aware they were the work of the fallen knight and 
    former Explorer Society, Candeth Martine. Martine had become something of a 
    hero to the people of Dereth, surviving against dire odds and becoming a 
    powerful legend. She knew also that he had assaulted Asheron and lost, and 
    that were it not for the Magus' care he would be dead now. “I discovered 
    much there, so much. . . but the most important thing my qu--Elysa, is the 
    Wharu.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She blinked. The word was wholly meaningless 
    to her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The Olthoi, rather. The spirit of decay that 
    the Tumeroks of the island battle.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ice crept along her neck and scalp. This was 
    too much to be a coincidence. Antius paused as she leaned back against the 
    chair and cast her gaze outside. Curtains plumed behind her, a stronger wind 
    was rising. She locked her gaze on a tree that clung tightly to its leaves, 
    defiant of the wind and the oncoming storm. Already, far in the distance, 
    rumbling thunder sounded and dark clouds gathered in the sky. The morning 
    sun was all but blotted from the sky. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Holding her gaze, she spoke. “Go on, Antius.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“They fought an Olthoi Queen once, Elysa.” 
    Darkness, like the roiling storm clouds, filled his voice. “They think she 
    is returned, or a fledgling at the very least.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A heavy silence filled the chamber. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She sat in the wooden chair, bare feet 
    planted firmly on the cold stones, her cotton smock and pants rippled in the 
    rising wind. She could not speak. No words could break the memory in her 
    mind, the sound of the Queen's death knell and the shattering of her own 
    heart. The silence hung until a thunder of footsteps in the corridor forced 
    them both to turn to the door. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A guard and a cook entered carrying a tray 
    with two cups of juice, two plates of toast and two apples. They, too, 
    glanced nervously at the glittering sentinels. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She stood suddenly and walked to the black 
    breastplate perched upon its stand. No--not black. A purple so deep it could 
    only be seen where in the highlights the guttering sunlight glittered.
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Antius, eat and use the library in this 
    place if you wish.” She turned to the guard. “See that Sir Blackmoor gets 
    all that he requires.” She pulled the breastplate off the stand and laid it 
    on her bed. Opening her armoire, she removed and began to don a set of heavy 
    quilted armor. The guard had wheeled and left the room already, leaving 
    Antius alone, she noticed his nervousness from the corner of her eye, such 
    manners after all were not befitting of a Queen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elysa--” he began, and faltered. An awkward 
    moment passed as his face contorted as he searched for the right words. She 
    looked toward him and wanted to laugh, even in the dark depth of the moment. 
    “--Where are you going?” he finally managed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She smirked, and went on about her dressing 
    leaving him to wonder as she strapped her leggings and reached for her bow. 
    Her hand hovered over the glowing wood, eyes going away for a moment. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Antius tugged a piece of the toast free and 
    popped it into his mouth as she pulled her helmet over her honey-colored 
    locks and made her way back toward him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She snapped a stern gaze on him and he 
    straightened, blushing. “I am going to talk to a friend,” she said firmly. 
    “I need you to do something for me, Scholar Blackmoor.” He nodded. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I need you to watch Marae Lassel for me, do 
    what you can to learn about the construction of the portals to that place, 
    and about Candeth Martine. We--” She stopped, her mouth left open on an 
    unuttered word, and shook her head. “Will you do this?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Yes, my Queen.” She allowed his use of the 
    honorific to go un-chided. After all, Antius had realized the difference 
    between friendly chatter and a regal request. <i>I hate having to do this</i>, 
    she thought. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Very good. I'd appreciate weekly reports 
    from you for a while.” She tightened her gloves and left the room, passing 
    her guards, who bowed their heads. She stopped in her tracks and skipped 
    back into the room. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She made her way to the table and snapped an 
    apple from the plate. “Sorry for running out on breakfast, Antius, but I 
    have very little time before Borelean wakes. Thank you for your warning.” 
    She turned then and disappeared through the doorway, her footfalls grew more 
    distant until they faded behind the rush of the wind and the thunder in the 
    distance. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">__________ </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><br>
    He wouldn't do that</i>, she thought as she walked past her guards and into 
    a private antechamber beneath the main floor. <i>Asheron told me how injured 
    the man is, body and soul, but he would not purposefully bring the Isparians 
    to harm. </i>Her thoughts rested on her discussion with Antius. She could 
    not fathom that Martine would open portals leading to a land under the sway 
    of an Olthoi Queen. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Looming shadows concealed her as she pulled 
    an orb from a belt pouch she carried. Incanting a phrase taught to her while 
    she was in her self-imposed exile, the sky split and enveloped her in 
    running streams of liquid silver. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There it was again--on the edge of hearing. A 
    certain squealing that no thing on Dereth or Ispar could make. She strained 
    to concentrate on the sound, to pull it from the cacophony. . . </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The silver threw itself past her, and the 
    world snapped back into place, the air trembling slightly from the abuse. 
    The smell of seawater teased her nose. She walked over to the cliff edge and 
    looked out over the ocean. The view from this place was what had brought her 
    to his island the first time, secluded and removed from the bustle and 
    responsibility. Borelean had liked it here because he could spend more time 
    with his mother. <i>Why did I ever leave?</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Behind her the sun was peeking through wispy 
    clouds, pitching shadows from the ivory tower that stood at the center of 
    the alabaster castle. Birds chirruped and butterflies danced from flower to 
    flower. Though the signs of autumn were apparent in the red and yellow 
    leaves, there remained an eternal, near immortal feel of this place. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She returned the orb to her pouch and walked 
    toward the door beyond the silent guardians. Her presence was known, of that 
    she was certain. Not a soul who entered could go unknown. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ornate tapestries graced the walls, woven in 
    the finest silk, depicting a time long before the arrival of the Isparians. 
    The flooring, tables, and chairs were all a testament to the beauty and 
    glory of a lost civilization. They were all slightly larger than those that 
    the Isparians used but they were more like home to her than the keep where 
    she lived now with her son and guardians. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Running her fingers along the edge of a 
    perfect marble table she found herself smiling, remembering a tender moment 
    spent with Borelean. She shook her head to free herself of the vision. There 
    was little time for whimsy now. Her melancholy all but forgotten she strode 
    to the main hall, toward the tower. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The door was open, and the guardians stood 
    unmoving. A warm red glow beckoned from within; she steadied her pace, 
    controlling her eagerness. It had been some months since she had been to see 
    him, now though she wanted nothing more than to trade memories over an 
    ancient wine, she knew that she must tell him. . . warn him of the coming 
    storm. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">His royal blue robes, trimmed in golden 
    brocade, were perfect. He sat beside a spinning vortex of red energy, 
    watching something within that only he could understand. She cleared her 
    throat to announce her arrival. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again she cleared her throat, and Asheron 
    finally looked her way. With a wave of his hand the vortex swirled in upon 
    itself and collapsed into darkness. He turned from her and motioned to the 
    seats where they had discussed goings-on many times before. He wore a solemn 
    expression, as if he knew already the words that she would speak. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Ash. . .” She spoke to him as she would any 
    other. “. . . there is much changing on Dereth.” He regarded her in silence 
    and nodded. “We have established a vanguard of our own against any enemies 
    that we may face and it appears as though we have driven the Virindi back.” 
    She was dodging. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I'm worried for you.” She paused and waited 
    for his reaction. None came. “Nuhmudira means to prepare for war. Martine, 
    it seems, has opened portals to a place where a new Olthoi brood and their 
    Queen live. I worry. . . that they do these things to strike against you.”
    </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Do you worry that they mean me harm, or that 
    they bear ill against you?” he asked. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She sighed and slumped into the chair 
    opposite him. “I don't know. I never wanted this, Asheron. This was never 
    what I wanted. I wanted a simple life for my son, but--” She stopped, 
    looking at him. “Did you know?” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“About the Island, and the portals, yes.” He 
    walked to the chair opposite her and sat. “Of Nuhmudira, no. My attentions 
    have been. . . elsewhere.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“What can I do to help you, Ash, these 
    people, they have no idea. . . they blame you for everything that they 
    face.” </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Elly, there is nothing you nor I can do. . 
    .” He turned from her. Stunned, she rose. “There are forces at work here 
    that you cannot understand,” he stated. Distant. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“But--” she began to protest. He turned back 
    to face her. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“This is that time of which I warned you. I 
    cannot--your people need a strong leader. You stated that to me, when you 
    chose to leave with Borelean. They need you, Elysa. As the Empyrean needed 
    me.” He paused and looked at her; she remained stone-faced, fighting the 
    frustration mounting within, and finally nodded. With a wave of his hand and 
    a final parting word, “Go to your people, Elysa,” she was returned to the 
    shadows. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She sighed and leaned against the wall. 
    Making her way back through the hallways, she stopped in her bedchamber to 
    remove her armor and found that Antius had left. She made her way onto her 
    landing and leaned against the balustrade. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">She played the memory over in her mind. They 
    sat, looking over the sea from a landing; they had been talking about 
    Cragstone while Borelean napped, and she had fallen to tears. Asheron had 
    turned to the sea and with a heavy heart spoken: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>I have done much in my life that I regret, 
    Elly, but none so much as the pain that I have caused you. I have taken your 
    life, your love, and left your son without a father. But my greatest regret 
    is that there will come a time when you need me most, and I will be 
    powerless to aid you.</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thunder crashed as a bolt of lightning tore 
    the sky. Rain fell in heavy drops, turning the light gray granite of her 
    keep an ominous black. She lifted her head to greet the rain with the same 
    candor she had the wind earlier this day. There was much to do once Borelean 
    was awake. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Outposts needed fortification, the people 
    needed guidance and protection, and she needed to be there for them. She 
    lifted her head to the rain to feel the drops wash over her face. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again the thunder came and the High Queen 
    returned to her duties. Alone. <br>
