    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am one of Nuhmudira's former students. I 
    happened to be working within the crystal storage warehouse at the same time 
    as it was robbed. I was in a corner packing a crate and heard a noise, what 
    must have been Aun Talamura having been struck from behind. I was on the far 
    end from the manager's chamber and crept nearer to see through the door. In 
    the room with Aun Talamura sprawled on the floor I saw... well, I cannot be 
    certain, but I could feel the presence of power. Fear then overcame me. I 
    quickly crept back to a corridor leading to an unused storage chamber and 
    peered around the corner. Numerous shadowy figures appeared and dashed about 
    grabbing the boxes of crystals. I could hear hissing. A portal was cast and 
    the creatures went through it, taking most of the boxes with them. A few 
    moments later the portal disappeared. Then, all was silent, the warehouse 
    almost empty. I went over to check on Aun Talamura. He still breathed, 
    thankfully he was still alive. I tried to decide what I should do next. I 
    should alert someone as I had just witnessed a deed that I was not meant to 
    see. Yet, I had also done something they did not expect.<br>
    <br>
    You see, I had tied to the portal! A few moments of indecision, several more 
    for summoning courage and I utilized the portal tie. As portal space churned 
    about me I berated myself for foolishly launching on this pursuit, yet I 
    knew I had to protect the interests of my teacher, Nuhmudira! I arrived in a 
    dungeon. Fortunately none of the perpetrators were present in the chamber 
    when I arrived, it appeared they had already taken the boxes of crystals 
    elsewhere. I could hear hissing and sounds of activity in the corridors 
    beyond. Heart pounding I crept forward. The sounds retreated into the 
    distance. Around a corner I discoverd <span lang="en-us">[sic] </span>the 
    stolen boxes but the creatures had left. It appeared most attention had been 
    given to one box of crystals of special value. I picked one up and realized 
    it must be very rare, it was unlike any I had seen previously. Placing it 
    within the folds of my robe I went further into this dungeon... and towards 
    great confusion and dismay. I did escape from there without notice, yet also 
    without future direction. Eventually I created a few portal gems tied to the 
    location of the perpetrator's portal. You may find them under some rocks 
    atop a plateau, next to a favorite lair of sandy armoredillos somewhat north 
    of my tent. I leave it to you to sort out the meaning in what you may find. 
    I will only tell you this- I know now there are convoluted schemes afoot.
    <br>
    <br>
    Trust whom you will, but realize the trust in your heart may be replaced by 
    a dagger.</font></p>
