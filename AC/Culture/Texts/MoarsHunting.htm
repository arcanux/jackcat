    <p><font face="arial" size="2">The bulk of this text was unreadable. 
    Numerous pages are missing and the covers appear to have been chewed upon. 
    Given the sad state of the original tome, it is difficult to successfully 
    translate it completely. The following writings are as close as I can come 
    to understanding the intent of the text. <br>
    <br>
    --- <br>
    <br>
    Much like previous texts, this book takes pains to differentiate between the 
    Moar and the creature created from the Moar. <br>
    <br>
    Even though we only know of the Moarsmen as they are now, they were 
    apparently once a very different creature, with a very different set of 
    habits, tastes, and hunting styles. <br>
    <br>
    The Moar is referred to as a variable hunter. The notes mention that they 
    hunted alone for their usual prey, but when bigger prey is present they were 
    known to form impromptu packs. The book comments on the ability of the Moar 
    to hunt and kill creatures that sound very similar to the Burun we have seen 
    appearing in our swamplands, although the creature described in the text 
    sounds built more like a tusker than the gangly creatures that we have 
    encountered. <br>
    <br>
    The Moarsman is noted as a vicious solitary hunter. Only when the prey is 
    many times the match for the Moarsman would it willingly cooperate with 
    others. The exception to that rule lies in the tamed Moarsmen that the 
    Falatacot kept as guards. These Moarsmen would forgo most of their 
    apprehension to working with others in the interest of a free meal. <br>
    <br>
    that the tamed Moarsmen were not killers. Quite the contrary, they were 
    known to attack and kill Sclavus servants that they were unfamiliar with.
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, the wild Moarsmen were credited largely with balancing the population 
    of the Burun on the world of Bur. The wild Moarsmen were responsible for 
    preventing their numbers from growing beyond the means for the mires to 
    support. <br>
