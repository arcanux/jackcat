    <td valign="top" width="439"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><small>Here are some of
    the historic organizations known to have existed in the homelands of the Gharu'ndim. How
    will these groups - and other groups not written of here - fare in the new land of Dereth?
    Your actions will doom some to the dull dust of obscurity, and raise others to the fiery
    glow of fame.</small></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Jaladhaqa
    Qalathina, the Jaladh</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    The Warriors&#146; Brotherhood</font></p>
    <font size="2"><p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;Truth always before the sword.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: Called &quot;Jaladh&quot; in all but the most formal
    cases, this is the Warriors&#146; Brotherhood. All fighting men and women of honor are
    permitted to join. The Jaladh are disciplined and dedicated to vanquishing evil in all its
    forms. They sometimes ally with the al-Khuraqa, but have been known to oppose them when
    the Eagle-Children embark on crusades the Jaladh consider dishonorable. They are sworn
    enemies of the Zharalim.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Some have lamented the lack of the Jaladh in Dereth.
    Perhaps some worthy and courageous new arrivals will re-form this much-respected
    organization.</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p><font color="#FFFFFF">Khuraqa Tha&#146;ratali, the
    al-Khuraqa</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Khuraqa Tha&#146;ratali, the
    al-Khuraqa</font></b><br>
    Children of the Eagle</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;Glory comes from battle alone.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: The al-Khuraqa believe Rakhil al-Khur, the warlike Malik
    who first conquered Gharu&#146;n, to have been the greatest fighter who ever lived, and
    have taken it upon themselves to do all they can to live up to his example. Formed within
    the last fifty years as a splinter faction of the much older Jaladh, the al-Khuraqa
    believe battle to be the greatest of all pursuits. Most of the time, they keep on the path
    of the Dozen Roads, but the al-Khuraqa are not squeamish about doing deeds the more rigid
    Jaladh would frown upon. They have little use for the more intellectual factions, and look
    down on the al-Sadharamad. Though they do not admit it openly, the al-Khuraqa have
    occasionally worked with the Zharalim in the past.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Dereth&#146;s challenges would be met with delight
    by any al-Khuraqa to arrive in this world. New monsters and lawless humans would be
    excellent targets. </small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Ighazaqa Talina, the
    al-Ighaz</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Ighazaqa Talina, the
    al-Ighaz</font></b><br>
    Academy of Sorcery</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;Power shared is thus made greater.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: The Academy of Sorcery, or al-Ighaz (&quot;the
    academy&quot;), is an exclusive sect devoted to furthering the study of the arcane arts.
    It possesses tremendous power within Gharu&#146;ndim society, but seldom deigns to wield
    it. All wizards of moderate power are invited to join the al-Ighaz; those who do not are
    looked upon with disfavor for keeping their secrets to themselves. The al-Ighaz rarely
    operate in the field in numbers, as do the warrior factions, although many individual
    members adventure on their own. The al-Ighaz and the Walim sometimes overlap in interests
    and duties, but the Academy cares little for any of the other factions &#150; least of all
    the al-Khuraqa.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: As of yet, no sign of the Academy&#146;s
    resurrection have been seen. However, there are plenty of opportunities to form a powerful
    society devoted to Dereth&#146;s magic, so perhaps, as knowledge grows&#133;.</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Walim</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Walim</font></b><br>
    The Searchers</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;The words of men bear Truth aloft.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: The Searchers, or Walim consider themselves distinct
    from and superior to the rest of Gharu&#146;ndim society. They appeared a few years after
    the death of the poet Yasif ibn Salayyar, vowing to continue his explorations of the
    nature of truth. They believe the way to truth comes through conversation. Hence, their
    main activity is talking &#133; and talking &#133; and talking. Walim will discuss
    everything, from whether there are more grains of sand in the Naqut desert than there are
    stars in the sky, to the color of the slippers they&#146;re wearing today. There is a
    saying: &quot;If you want to kill a foe swiftly, send a Zharalim. If you wish him to die
    slowly and in agony, shut him in a room full of Walim.&quot; To keep conversation
    interesting, many Walim travel and seek out new experiences. In their minds, only the
    al-Ighaz approach their level, though many wizards are too focused on magic for their
    tastes. Still, the Walim will allow anyone who enjoys philosophizing into their ranks.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Though no formal return of the Walim has been noted,
    some newcomers, even those of other Heritage Groups, have been mistaken for members of
    that august faction.</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">al-Sadharamad</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">al-Sadharamad</font></b><br>
    The Way of Stealth</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;Do no harm, but take what you will.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: The al-Sadharamad, or Way of Stealth, is actually a very
    loose but extensive alliance of individual thieves&#146; factions. Their members seldom
    follow all of the Dozen Roads, but neither are they thugs. Instead, the al-Sadharamad
    prefer to steal from the immoral, or to go adventuring for their riches. They are thus
    surprisingly well-liked by the common people (though not the wealthy classes). They are
    indifferent to other groups save the Zharalim, who have historically besmirched the honor
    of thieves. Rather than openly fighting the assassins, however, the al-Sadharamad prefer
    trickery, exposing their enemies for the killers they are and letting others dirty their
    hands with the punishment.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: There is so much treasure for the taking that, as
    some people joke, &quot;Everyone here is al-Sadharamad, whether they know it or not.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <font size="2"><b><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Shagar Zharala, the Zharalim</font></b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF">Shagar Zharala, the Zharalim</font></b><br>
    The Order of Assassins</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><em>Motto: &quot;To fight darkness, first become a shadow.&quot;</em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Background: Founded by Malik Amul ibn Rakhil as a covert weapon to
    avenge the torture of Yasif ibn Salayyar, the Shagar Zharala, or Zharalim, are the most
    feared and misunderstood group in Gharu&#146;n. They exist outside the strictures of the
    Dozen Roads, based on the belief that evil is best fought with evil. They are professional
    killers, who will use any method at their disposal to see a job done. They kill out of a
    profound sense of duty, and not out of pleasure. They are, in fact, effectively under a
    constant contract to hunt down and eliminate those who do commit murder wantonly (as it
    gives them a bad name). They do not even return other groups&#146; hatred, since they see
    other Factions as tools for carrying out contracts. As such, they have agents everywhere;
    there is even a rumour that Malik Sunadin the Unlucky met his untimely end at the hands of
    his own sister, who was secretly Zharalim. As other tales of the Order, the truth will
    likely never be known.</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Current: Many hope that too few of the Zharalim will ever
    arrive to form a cohesive, unified force in Dereth, but others are not so sure. Perhaps
    now is the time for the Zharalim to re-form, as a new shadow against this world&#146;s
    darkness.</small></font></td>
