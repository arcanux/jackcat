    from </i></font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>The Nights of
    al-Nafalt</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>, a history composed of tales told
    by various personages who lived in that lost palace in its most glorious days, back in the
    old world. This story is believed to have been told by Mansur al-Rajan, who later in life
    became vizier to Malik Tu&#146;azar ibn Amul.</i></font></p>
    <font size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Do you know, I can still smell the
    almond blossoms? It is a strange thing, memory, all the more now that my days near their
    end. I could not tell you what I had for supper yesterday, or what color tunic the Malika
    wore, but that scent remains.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I was fourteen years old, and a scullion in the
    palace of the al-Nafalt, when Yasif ibn Salayyar went to Milantos. I had met him before
    &#150; he had a fancy for sweets, and would come sometimes to the kitchen to snack on
    honeyed dates &#150; but we had never spoken before then. It was not a servant&#146;s
    place to talk with the royal emissary, after all.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">He traveled a great deal in those days, over land
    and sea. Gharu&#146;n was a young kingdom then, and many of the other realms about the
    Ironsea had not recognized our sovereignty. He sailed to Aluvia and Viamont, spent a year
    in Roulea, even voyaged as far as the land of the Silverans. One by one, his quick mind
    and glib tongue won the respect of neighboring rulers &#150; all but the Milantans. Again
    and again they refused his petitions to travel to their nation and hold parley with Arpad,
    their king. In time, the politeness of the refusals gave way to hostility and threats. But
    the Emissary would not be daunted: he would only wait a season, then ask again.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So it would have remained, I suppose, until the end
    of time, but for the fact that King Arpad was, like all men, mortal. I don&#146;t remember
    hearing about it when he died, but I heard the stories afterward. Accounts varied wildly:
    it was known he was involved in dark rites, and some said he&#146;d made the mistake of
    summoning a beast he could not control. Others claimed he was murdered by one of his
    courtiers &#150; just which courtier that was, and how he&#146;d been killed, varied with
    the teller.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The truth, as it happened &#150; and I know this
    only because the Poet told me later, after the events I mean to relate &#150; was that
    Arpad had swallowed a chicken bone, and choked to death while his concubines looked on.
    Any of them could have helped him; none did. Would you save a tyrant&#146;s life if you
    could?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Poet did not take delight in Arpad&#146;s
    untimely demise: he was not that sort of man. But he <i>did</i> send a new petition to the
    Milantan court, hoping to catch the eye of the new king, Laszko. Laszko was not a true
    heir &#150; Arpad had no children, and his brothers had all died young and suspiciously
    &#150; but rather Arpad&#146;s chief advisor, a man schooled in the ways of both sorcery
    and war. No one knew much else about him, and no one, not even the Poet himself, expected
    his response to be any different from Arpad&#146;s. Imagine everyone&#146;s surprise,
    then, when Laszko accepted.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yasif came to the palace kitchen the night before he
    was to depart. I was the only one there: it was late, and the other servants had taken to
    their beds while I raked the ashes in the great hearth. He came in quietly, as was his
    way, but cleared his throat softly to warn me he was there, so I didn&#146;t scare myself
    half to death when I turned from the coals. He grinned mischievously at me &#150; I know,
    it&#146;s hard to imagine such a look on his face, but there it was &#150; as he opened
    the jar of dates. He took one, offered me another. I accepted &#150; who was I to refuse
    the royal emissary? &#150; and we munched them together in the silence, him carefully
    groomed, me grimy and grey with soot.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;I do not know what awaits me in
    Milantos,&quot; he told me. &quot;The Malik, praised be his name, does not trust this King
    Laszko. Nor, I suppose, do I.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Then why do you go?&quot; I asked, greatly
    daring. Trust me that the first time I ever spoke to him, it would be to challenge his
    wisdom.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Because I must,&quot; he said, and finished
    his date. &quot;There are things one must do, even in the face of sure danger. I am the
    Malik&#146;s Emissary, therefore I will go, though I fear I shall not return.&quot; It was
    strange, the word &#145;fear&#146; coming from such a man. &quot;Do you understand,
    lad?&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Yes, my lord,&quot; I answered, though I<i>
    didn&#146;t</i> understand. Not then, anyway.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And that was that. Yasif never saw me again, though
    I would see him. His caravan departed for the port of Mawwuz the next morning, and thence
    he sailed to Milantos, for his long-awaited parley. That was the last anyone saw of him
    for five years.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It was nearly winter, and snow freckled the western
    mountains, when the rumors started. By that time, the Emissary had been gone for six
    months, two more than expected. This was not unusual, for the whims of rulers oftimes keep
    diplomats away from home overlong. Etien of Viamont, in particular, was notorious for
    this: once, he&#146;d kept the Poet at his court for nearly half a year longer than was,
    strictly speaking, proper.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But word began to spread that this was no ordinary
    absence. The older servants were sure some ill had befallen Yasif. If all the tales had
    been true, he would have had an unpleasant voyage indeed: captured by Viamonter pirates,
    waylaid by Souia-Vey bandits, thrown into the dungeons beneath Laszko&#146;s palace,
    flogged, poisoned, stabbed, stoned, and torn to pieces by wild animals in the way the
    Rouleans once did in their arenas. The more stories I heard, the more I hungered to know
    the truth, and the harder it became to sort through the lies.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the end, I had no choice but to go to the highest
    authority I knew. No, not the Malik, of course, nor any of his courtiers or generals. I
    didn&#146;t have their ears &#150; not then, at least. But there <i>was</i> one man I
    could trust: Jadagur, the royal cupbearer. He was also a servant, you see, and he owed me
    a favor for certain aid I&#146;d rendered him in wooing Irdana, the baker, who had since
    become his wife. So I cornered Jadagur in the kitchen one night when he came to fetch mead
    for the Malik, and asked him what he knew of the Poet&#146;s absence.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;First you must swear,&quot; he said, after
    much cajoling. &quot;No idle talk of this in the kitchens. The Malik will know I talked,
    and mount my severed head on Eagle&#146;s Claw Gate.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I swore, on my father&#146;s name, that I would
    sooner stuff myself in the oven than speak a word of this to anyone else while Jagadur
    lived. I keep my promises, which is why I have not told this tale until now that he is
    dead, his body burned.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">That seemed to satisfy Jagadur, although I&#146;m
    sure the flask of palm wine I&#146;d brought to loosen his tongue helped a little, too.
    &quot;It&#146;s passing strange,&quot; he told me. &quot;The Malik, praised be his name,
    is furious with worry. The Emissary is not only past due to return, but there had been no
    word.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;No word?&quot; I echoed, hardly believing.
    &quot;Are you sure?&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Jagadur nodded solemnly. &quot;I am. The Malik,
    praised be, asks the royal courier every day for tidings, and gets none.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">This was troubling indeed. Anyone who knows aught of
    Yasif ibn Salayyar knows how he loved to write. Not a day went by at al-Nafalt when he did
    not pen some verse, parable or fable, and even when he was away he sent messages back to
    the Malik every week. That he would be gone for so long, and not a word, was simply wrong.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;What&#146;s to be done?&quot; I asked.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;I don&#146;t know,&quot; Jagadur answered.
    &quot;But there is talk of war.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>War.</i> The word excited and sickened me at the
    same time. Gharu&#146;n, you must understand, had not</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">been to war since the siege of Tirethas, when the
    realm had taken shape. Yasif would have frowned on such a thing, and the thought of the
    Malik taking up arms over him was truly terrible.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;So,&quot; I said, &quot;the court believes
    Yasif is dead.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Jagadur nodded. &quot;The generals are sure of it,
    and the Malik, praised be, thinks so too. Now I must go,&quot; he added, glancing around.
    &quot;His Majesty wants his mead, and it&#146;s my head if he sends another man to look
    for me. Remember your promise.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I remembered, and told no one. And sure enough,
    within another month there was more than talk of war. Soldiers began to gather at the
    palace, drafted from all across the land. The Malik was preparing an army, and for once
    all the servant-gossip agreed: when it was assembled and trained, he would send it east
    across the hills, into Milantos. He might even have led it himself &#150; like his father,
    the legendary Rakhil, Malik Amul was a warrior nonpareil &#150; if the Black-Sealed Scroll
    had not arrived.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The scroll arrived on Midwinter&#146;s Eve, less
    than a fortnight before the army was due to march. Jagadur &#150; whom I was now regularly
    giving filched palm wine in exchange for news &#150; told me the courier&#146;s face was
    as white as an Aluvian&#146;s when he brought it. He handed it directly to the Malik,
    rather than giving it to his vizier, but Amul did not reprimand him once he saw the seal
    upon it: a snarling wolf&#146;s head pressed in black wax. King Laszko&#146;s seal.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><i>My lord Amul</i>, the scroll read. <i>My spies
    say you are readying an army. March on my lands, and your beloved Emissary will scream
    long and loud before he dies</i>. Below, it bore a second black-wolf seal.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">But that was not the worst. For furled in the
    scroll, meticulously cleaned and drained of blood, was a finger. It was ebon-skinned, with
    a silver ring shaped like twining vines. There was no doubt that the finger had once
    adorned the hand of Yasif ibn Salayyar.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Malik flew into a rage that lasted three days.
    He swore to tear down King Laszko&#146;s palace stone by stone, and put every Milantan to
    the sword &#150; man, woman and child. In the end, though, his better judgment won out: he
    took King Laszko&#146;s threat to heart and disbanded the army. He sent missives to
    Milantos, demanding the Emissary&#146;s return. When he received no reply, he asked what
    Laszko wanted as ransom. Still there was no answer, and finally, two years after Yasif
    sailed out of Mawwuz, the Malik&#146;s messages became pleas for a reason why the
    Milantans had kidnapped his Emissary.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Finally, there came a response: a second scroll,
    this one blank. With it, a second finger: proof the Poet still lived. But still there was
    no reason.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Soon after that, people began to disappear from the
    al-Nafalt. The youngest of the Mailk&#146;s courtiers were first, then some of the best
    soldiers, and finally even servants. Dozens vanished without a trace, men and women alike,
    not a one older than seventeen summers. It was as if one of the old gods had stolen them,
    and indeed many of the servants believed just that. Even Jagadur refused to speak of it,
    and when I pressed him on the matter he walked away, and never asked me for palm wine
    again.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The next day they came for me.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The stories of the disappearances told of masked,
    black-cloaked men coming in the night to steal the young men. In fact, those tales could
    not have been more wrong. It was morning when they came for me, and they were dressed as
    servants &#150; but I had never seen them before. Still, when they closed around me and I
    felt the edge of a jambiya against my ribs, I did not argue. They promised I would not be
    harmed if I went with them quietly, so I went.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I&#146;d like to say I was brave, that I didn&#146;t
    weep or tremble as they led me out of the al-Nafalt and into the carriage that waited in
    the courtyard, but that would be a lie, and an obvious one at that. I was sixteen and
    callow, and once I was alone in the dark carriage &#150; it had no windows and its doors
    were locked &#150; I blubbered like an infant. It was a long journey: I don&#146;t know
    exactly how long, for I spent the whole trip in the dark, save when my captors opened the
    doors long enough to give me bread and fresh water, but I reckon it was five days at the
    least. By the time the voyage ended, I no longer wept nor shivered. I was numb. I was also
    unused to sunlight, and I was blind for a while after they let me out of the carriage
    again.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When my eyes started working again, I found I was in
    the courtyard of a stout fortress &#150; old, probably Roulean, but with signs of having
    been newly fortified in the past few days. All around us loomed tall mountains, their
    snowy peaks shrouded in clouds. Whether they were of the eastern range or the western, I
    still do not know.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I was not alone, either. The other lost ones, the
    young people who had mysteriously and quietly vanished from the al-Nafalt, were in the
    courtyard too. I asked, but none knew why we were there. Our guards would not speak to us
    at all. One thing was clear, though: we couldn&#146;t leave. We were prisoners &#150; of
    whom, no one knew, though many were sure the Milantans were involved.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">I wasn&#146;t the last to arrive at the keep, but I
    was close. A few more arrived, about one every other day, for the next two weeks. Finally,
    the windowless carriages stopped altogether. We numbered fifty exactly, all orphans whom
    no one would truly miss, all uncertain of our fates. We dwelt in that ignorance for a full
    month. Our guards kept us well &#150; in truth, my life in that mountain prison was more
    comfortable than it had ever been as a scullion.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">After thirty days, our keepers herded us into the
    courtyard. When we had formed into orderly rows the gates opened, and a band of hooded
    riders galloped in. They pulled up before us, and the leader dismounted and stepped up
    onto a wooden dais the guards had forced us to build the day before. He cast off his hood,
    and all fifty of us gasped as one. Of all the people we had thought our captor might be,
    none of us had dared imagine it was the Malik himself. Yet there he was, Amul ibn Rakhil
    in all his glory, looking down on us with haughty compassion.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We knelt, of course. He was our king. We stayed that
    way, heads bowed so they touched the ground, until he bade us stand. Then, as we stared in
    wonder, he spoke.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;You have been chosen for a grave
    responsibility,&quot; he told us. &quot;As you know, the greatest of my subjects, the poet
    and royal emissary Yasif ibn Salayyar, has been missing these past two years. I have sworn
    to bring him back, but cannot do it by force of arms. Instead, you will do it for
    me.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You can imagine the murmuring that followed. It took
    a while, and a fair bit of shouting from the guards, to quiet us down. When we were still
    again, the Malik was smiling.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;I understand your confusion,&quot; he told us.
    &quot;I will explain. When I was a boy, Yasif had me read many of the ancient texts
    written by the philosophers of Old Roulea. One of those was the <i>Treatises</i> of
    Archephoros. It is an old tome, perhaps two thousand years, but there is much truth in it.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;As I was pondering the Poet&#146;s fate, I
    kept returning to one passage in particular,&quot; he went on. &quot; &#145;To fight the
    dark, one must sometimes be a shadow.&#146; &quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">He looked at us a long time, not saying anything. We
    were quiet too: we didn&#146;t really know what was happening, but we knew it was
    important. More than that, we knew <i>we</i> were important. For me, for many of us, it
    was the first time that was so.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Finally, the Malik took a deep breath. &quot;You are
    to be my shadows,&quot; he told us. &quot;For the next three years, you will live here.
    You will learn to fight, kill, steal and lie. When you are done, each of you will be a
    weapon, as keen and merciless as any blade. You will be the Shagar Zharala, the Walkers in
    Shade. And the best of you will go the Milantos, bring back the Poet, and wreak vengeance
    upon King Laszko.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">He said nothing more; he simply stepped down from
    the dais, swung up into his saddle once more, and rode back out of the fortress with his
    guards. We did not see him again in those three years.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So began my training as an assassin. Of those years,
    I can say little: I am bound by oaths sealed in blood not to reveal the secrets I learned
    there. I will say that they were not easy times, and many of us broke, either in body or
    spirit. Some went mad, others were crippled. A few even died. We heard nothing of the
    outside world in all that time: for us, our world ended with the fortress walls, and the
    mountains around it. Yet none of us sought escape &#150; looking back, I think the
    Malik&#146;s agents had known we wouldn&#146;t when they chose us. Those of us who made it
    through unbroken (I will not say unscathed, for all of us bore scars when our training
    came to an end) became the first of the Zharalim &#150; thirty-six of the original fifty,
    all blades thirsting for blood. I was nineteen.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Those three years were hard on the Malik, as well:
    when he returned, his beard had run grey, though he had not yet seen forty summers. We
    assembled before him as we had done before our training began, but we were confused,
    frightened boys and girls no longer. We were women and men, ready to fight and die at his
    word. He surely knew this, for there was sorrow in his voice when he spoke.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;The time for training is done,&quot; he
    proclaimed. &quot;We must act, and soon.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yasif, he told us, was still alive: he had received
    two more fingers from King Laszko since our training began, but still no explanation or
    demand for ransom. The last message, however, had intimated that the Poet&#146;s days
    would soon end. That missive had come two months ago.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Already I fear we have tarried too long,&quot;
    he told us. &quot;Your masters have selected the dozen of you they have deemed best. Those
    will return with me to the al-Nafalt on the morrow.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">With that, he stepped down, and the masters began
    calling the names of those who would embark to Milantos. I was third on that list, and
    when I stepped forward to kneel before the Malik, I was fairly bursting with pride. Three
    years ago, I had been a mere scullion, and now I was one of king&#146;s chosen!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Chosen or not, however, I still rode back to the
    al-Nafalt in a windowless carriage. I have never returned to the mountain fastness where I
    had my training, nor could I if I tried. The next time I saw light, I was in the main
    plaza of the palace, with the other eleven assassins chosen for the mission. A herald
    summoned us to the Malik&#146;s court, and soon we knelt before his turquoise-studded
    throne. I remember greatly enjoying the stunned look Jagadur the cupbearer gave me as the
    Malik bade us rise.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;You have trained in the skills you need,&quot;
    the Malik declared. &quot;While you have done so, my spies and scholars have divined much
    about Milantos, and what you might face. You have a week to learn all you can, then you
    will set out on your mission. Some will go by sea from Mawwuz, some by land across the
    eastern hills, but all will &#150; &quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Something extraordinary happened then. For the first
    time I had heard of &#150; perhaps for the first time in his life &#150; someone
    interrupted the Malik of Gharu&#146;n.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It was the court herald, the same man who had
    summoned us to the audience hall, but he had lost his cool diffidence, and now more
    resembled one of the pale chalkfish I had sometimes filleted, back in my scullion days. He
    pushed the court&#146;s towering, mahogany doors open a bit too hard &#150; it was the
    double-bang of them hitting the walls that cut off the Malik in midsentence &#150; then
    stood there, pale, pop-eyed and gaping, while everyone stared back at him. There were
    levin-bolts in the Malik&#146;s dark eyes.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Well, then?&quot; asked Fathim, who was the
    Malik&#146;s vizier at the time. &quot;Why this disruption, man? Speak!&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The herald could only sputter in reply, but that
    didn&#146;t matter, for soon we saw the reason. Yasif ibn Salayyar hobbled into the room.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">It&#146;s the silence I remember most about that
    moment. Aside from the faint, slightly uneven whisper of the Poet&#146;s footsteps,
    nothing broke the stillness. We all stared, amazed, as he entered the court, tottered
    halfway to the throne, and stopped, turned slightly away from the dais.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">They had taken his eyes. That was the first thing I
    noticed, before his fingerless left hand, before his gaunt, stooped frame, even before the
    way that, in the five years he had been missing, he seemed to have aged twenty. He wore no
    cloth across his face, as blind men often do, nor did he keep his eyes shut. Instead he
    stared into the vague distance with two sightless holes in place of the gleaming,
    intelligent orbs that had sometimes met mine across the kitchen.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;Ancient gods,&quot; the Malik swore, and sat
    down heavily on his throne. The sound crystallized the moment, changed it from a waking
    dream into reality.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yasif smiled. He was missing teeth, too. &quot;My
    lord,&quot; he said. &quot;It is good to hear your voice again at last.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We twelve, the blades Amul had spent a fortune
    carefully honing for the past three years, quickly found ourselves forgotten. There were
    tears and laughter both. The Poet told his tale: King Laszko had been using him in some
    prolonged, dark ritual, invoking the same demoniac beings King Arpad had been said to
    worship. The experience had nearly ruined him, he said: ironically, it was the blinding,
    the inability to see the horrors that surrounded him, that had saved him from madness. He
    never spoke of those long years in detail, never told me what he faced. Even years later,
    it gave him nightmares.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">When Laszko&#146;s ritual was done, he said, he was
    sure he would die. The sorcerous forces might even have torn his soul apart. But instead,
    with scarcely a month before the end came, a miracle happened. His own jailer, the one man
    with whom he&#146;d spoken at any length during his imprisonment, had come to his rescue.
    Refusing to let Yasif perish, he turned against his own king and freed the Poet, smuggling
    him out of the dungeon and away from Milantos. It was an intricate escape &#150; the
    jailer had clearly been planning it for some time &#150; and it had most likely cost the
    jailer his life, but Yasif had made it to a galleon bound for Mawwuz, and from there had
    made his way back to the palace.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The tale told, the Emissary turned and looked toward
    we twelve blades. Looked <i>through</i> us, actually. &quot;It would seem,&quot; he said
    quietly, &quot;that you will not need your avengers after all, my lord.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The Malik was silent for a time, then shook his
    head. No one seemed surprised that Yasif knew about us.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;No,&quot; the Malik said at length, his voice
    low and solemn. &quot;They are still needed. If not for you, than for that dog,
    Laszko.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;That is not necessary, my lord,&quot; Yasif
    declared. &quot;I am safe now, back in my beloved al-Nafalt. I do not need blood to quiet
    my soul.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;That may be,&quot; Amul declared. &quot;But I
    do. No, Poet,&quot; he added as Yasif opened his mouth to speak. &quot;Laszko did not only
    hold you hostage while he performed his depredations. Through you, he captured me, and my
    whole kingdom. I will have my revenge &#150; not even your honeyed words will sway me from
    this.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Even now, after so long, I understand the
    Malik&#146;s thinking more than the Poet&#146;s. For five years, King Laszko had tormented
    his closest adviser and dearest friend &#150; and, through his silence, had tormented Amul
    as well. Of course he yearned for vengeance. Other than Yasif himself, who would not?</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yasif seemed to understand this, though he shook his
    head grimly as he replied. &quot;So,&quot; he said. &quot;You will do this thing, I know,
    whether I assent or not. Two things, however, my liege. First, death is never a balm. So
    Archephoros wrote in the <i>Treatises</i>.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;I remember,&quot; the Malik said quietly.
    &quot;And the other?&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;I would ask you to spare one of your blades,
    and give him to me. I will be needing a guide now, in my darkness.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Amul thought on this, but not for long. If he could
    not forgive his friend&#146;s torturer, neither could he deny the Poet&#146;s request.
    &quot;Very well,&quot; he said. &quot;Which would you take?&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And then, though he could no more see me than a man
    can touch the moon, the Poet looked straight at me with those twin, sightless pits.
    Afterward, he said he recognized the sound of my breathing. That may be so &#150;
    Yasif&#146;s hearing was astounding in his final years &#150; but somehow I think there
    was something else at work.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">&quot;That one,&quot; he said, nodding. &quot;The
    kitchen boy.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">So the Poet&#146;s compassion spared my life, and
    most likely my soul as well. The other eleven Zharalim left a week later, as planned. All
    of them perished before they could return, but they succeeded in their quest. One day, it
    is said, King Laszko went out riding in the hills, and was never seen again. Nor was his
    body ever found. He never completed the unholy sacrament for which he had tortured the
    Poet.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yasif &#150; or, if you will, old Archephoros &#150;
    had been right about death and balms. The Malik found some satisfaction in Laszko&#146;s
    death, but even so he was troubled to the end of his days. The Zharalim, so the story
    says, continue to exist, and even now, from time to time, a young man or woman
    mysteriously vanishes from the al-Nafalt, bound, I am certain, for that hidden keep in the
    mountains.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">As for me, I gave up my life as a shadow-walker
    before it truly began, and I do not regret it. No longer fit to serve as Emissary, Yasif
    simply became the Poet. Without eyes, however, he could not write, so I served as his
    scribe as well as his guide. When we weren&#146;t at court, we spent many a day in the
    Garden of Almonds, his favorite place in the whole palace, he speaking verses aloud while
    I sat beside him with quill, book and ink. It is my hand that wrote the first copy of the <i>Alamakhaida</i>,
    his greatest work, from which scholars have since gathered the Dozen Roads of honor. I was
    there, twenty years ago, when he died, quietly, beneath the blooming trees. I held his
    body in my arms.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">And do you know? I can still smell the almond
    blossoms.</font></font></td>
