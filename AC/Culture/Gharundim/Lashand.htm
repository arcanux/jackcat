    from Suma bint Nayn the Librarian in Zaikhal - 13.8N, 0.1E</font></span><p><font face="Arial"><em><small>This story is from a parchment
    that was found in Dereth:</small></em></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>There
    came a time, in the reign of the Malik Taraj al-Saum, when the call went out for warriors.
    This was a strange thing, for the land had known peace for many years, and no foe yet
    loomed upon the horizons. The Gharu'ndim were a prosperous people, and the smiths forged
    many more plowshares than swords. But still, even in the quietest of days, the need for
    fighters sometimes arose. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>It was a minor noble, the Mu'allim Fasair ibn
    Jambuz, who sent out the call. From his manor in the hills of Qush, a dozen runners went
    out, bearing missives scribed on the finest vellum. They traveled across the land, to the
    cities and towns and also the camps amid the dunes, bearing his words to anyone who would
    take up their blades and follow. Men from all over answered the call. Most were
    youngsters, barely able to grow proper beards and eager to prove their mettle, but there
    were older men as well, who had been fine swordsmen in their youth and had grown restless
    for days of action. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>By the time the messengers returned to
    Fasair's manor, each led a score or more of the land's finest warriors - more than two
    hundred and fifty in all. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Among these warriors came Ibriya bint Raglan.
    This was some time ago, when the sight of women wearing armor and bearing swords was still
    strange. In fact, Ibriya was unique within the host that descended upon Fasair's manor.
    When she first presented herself to the Mu'allim's messenger, the other warriors responded
    with jeers and mockery. The messenger himself tried to dissuade her from joining the
    company, but she was adamant. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>She went along, though the other warriors
    scorned and avoided her, calling her a wanton girl who did not know her own station. Even
    so, Ibriya was in the front of the throng when it assembled before the silver gates of
    Fasair's manor. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Mu'allim appeared on a balcony on the
    topmost floor of his home, resplendent in golden tunic and snow-white turban. He gazed
    down upon the mob, who stared back anxiously, awaiting his word. He did not see Ibriya -
    if he had, he would have turned her away, and this story's ending might have been much
    different. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Instead, he raised his hands, each festooned
    with rings of gold and turquoise, and bellowed for silence. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I have called you here,&quot; Fasair
    declared, &quot;because I seek the strongest arms and the quickest blades.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The warriors who had gathered murmured and
    glanced importantly at one another, their chests swelling with pride, none more haughty
    than when they glared at Ibriya. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;You may have heard of the death of the
    swordsman, Ulyush al-Nadur,&quot; continued the Mu'allim. Most of the warriors nodded
    knowingly: Ulyush, one of the most renowned fighters in the kingdom, had perished barely a
    month ago, in the jaws of the Beast of Hawwun - which is itself a tale of note, but not
    for the telling now. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;When he died, Ulyush was betrothed to
    my daughter, Lashanda,&quot; said Fasair. &quot;The ceremony of marriage was to take place
    three days hence. Though Ulyush lies cold in his tomb, I am determined that the wedding go
    ahead. I have called all of you here to vie for my daughter's hand.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The messengers had said nothing of this, and
    there was some consternation among the ranks. Many of the warriors already had wives, and
    a number were already promised. And while it was true, in those days as in these, that a
    man was not limited to one wife, nor a woman to one husband, it was not fitting for a
    Mu'allim's daughter to be anything but a man's First Wife. Of the scores who had come to
    Qush, more than a hundred had made the journey in vain. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Why did you not tell us this?&quot;
    asked one of the older men, a grizzled veteran who already had three wives and a small
    host of children. &quot;I have come a hundred leagues from my home, and for nothing!&quot;
    </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Other warriors shouted in agreement, but the
    Mu'allim raised his hands. &quot;Please, my friends!&quot; Fasair shouted. &quot;Be at
    peace. If it were common knowledge that I sought a husband for Lashanda, my manor would
    have been swamped with would-be suitors, most of them unacceptable. That is why I hid the
    truth, even from my own messengers. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>I understand that many of you cannot compete,
    and I am sure that others will not wish to do so. I will make recompense for your
    inconvenience: half a hundred pieces of gold to each man who does not enter the
    tournament, and my hospitality from now until the tournament is done.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Fasair was a shrewd man. By promising gold to
    those who did not fight, he not only placated those who could not enter, but also kept the
    greediest knaves from entering the tournament. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>He also kept out those who were given to too
    much drink: there was a feast that night at the manor, with much boasting and freely
    flowing wine, and when the seneschal came around at dawn the next day, calling for those
    who wished to enter to gather in the courtyard, the men who had drunk too much were in no
    shape to do so. Thus, the scribes' lists of those who were to enter the tourney bore only
    seventy-three names. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>One of those was Ibriya bint Raglan. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The seneschal was surprised to see her come
    forward. &quot;How can you enter the tournament?&quot; he asked. &quot;It is not
    proper.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;It is not forbidden,&quot; she replied
    coolly. Which was true. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Still troubled, the seneschal sought out the
    Mu'allim. Fasair, however, only laughed. &quot;Seventy men and one woman,&quot; he
    scoffed. &quot;Those are long odds. Let her join: she will lose in the first bout
    anyway.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>So Ibriya's name was put on the roster, and
    on the first morning of the tournament she dueled with Ghalan al-Tarith, a swordsman of
    some repute from the north country. They fought with blunted blades - the tournament was
    not meant to bring death upon the defeated - and after several minutes of circling each
    other and trading quick flurries of blows, she knocked away his own weapon, sent him
    stumbling back with a vicious slash, and ended up straddling his chest, her sword pressed
    against his throat. The judge of the fight, who had clearly favored Ghalan throughout the
    bout, had no choice in the end but to declare Ibriya the winner. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>That afternoon, Ibriya won her second bout
    just as handily as she had the first, and in even less time: in only took half a dozen
    passes for her to disarm her foe and rap him hard in the chest with the blunted tip of her
    weapon. Another clear victory, reluctantly declared by a judge who feared what the
    Mu'allim would do when he heard about it. As the tourney's first day closed,
    three-quarters of the combatants were out of the running: Ibriya was not one of them. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>That night, after the feasting was done, the
    Mu'allim summoned her to his private garden. They stood on a terrace overlooking a grove
    of almond trees, surrounding a bubbling fountain. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I will give you five hundred pieces of
    gold,&quot; Fasair told her, &quot;if you withdraw from the tournament.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I thought you were sure I would
    lose,&quot; she replied, sipping the Mu'allim's excellent wine. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>He smiled. &quot;I did this morning. Now, I
    am not so sure.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>She inclined her head politely, then shook
    it. &quot;Respectfully, my lord, I cannot withdraw. It would not be honorable, no matter
    what compensation I received. Besides, I am but one of twenty. Luck is still against
    me.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The next morning, Ibriya was unsurprised to
    find herself matched against Dusif ibn Walar. Dusif, who was known simply as the Ox, was a
    massive man, capable of lifting any of the other combatants at the tournament above his
    head with little effort. His previous opponent had been forced to yield and bow out when
    the Ox broke his swordarm. Ibriya knew it was no coincidence that she would be paired with
    such a fearsome foe: it was the Mu'allim's message to her, and the message was, Out. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But Ibriya knew something else about the Ox,
    for she had watched his earlier fights with the suspicion that she would be made to fight
    him before the tourney was done. During the fights, she had seen that, besides being
    strong, Dusif had little else going for him. With big came slow, and Dusif moved like an
    ogre from the old tales. On top of that, he had been breathing heavily by the end of each
    bout, though they had been short and he had moved very little: he had strength, but no
    stamina. Seeing this, Ibriya had made a plan. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Now, when the war drums sounded the beginning
    of the fight, Ibriya carried out that strategy. As the Ox was charging toward her, howling
    in battle rage, his massive sword raised high, she turned and ran. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>At first the onlookers jeered, calling her a
    coward; she paid them no mind at all. Ibriya did not mean to flee; she simply meant always
    to be moving, never staying in one place long enough for the Ox to catch her. He lumbered
    after her, but she always kept just out of his weapon's reach. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The Ox began to tire. After a few minutes he
    was breathing with his mouth open; he chased her for a few more, and soon was covered in
    sweat. It became harder and harder for him to keep pace with her, even though she slowed
    her pace to keep tempting him onward. At last his weapon drooped, and he doubled over,
    hands on knees, wheezing. She finished him with two quick strokes, the second of which
    struck the side of his head and would have shorn it in two if her sword had been real. He
    crumpled to the ground, senseless. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then she was one of ten, with the final round
    to come that evening. The Mu'allim's seneschal sought her out at the midday meal, and
    doubled his master's offer. She sent him away, but not before striking him across the face
    for trying to bribe her. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The second-to-last round was different from
    the first three: instead of a man-on-man duel, it was to be an open melee. All the
    remaining combatants gathered at the fighting grounds, armed with sword and shield. The
    seneschal himself took the judge's place, and Ibriya's spirit sank: not only were the nine
    men who would fight with her eyeing her with disdain, but she knew the seneschal would not
    ignore what had passed between them earlier. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;The fighting will continue until all
    but two are defeated,&quot; the seneschal proclaimed, and smiled venomously at her. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The fight was fast and brutal. The men
    battled Ibriya in twos and threes. She fought back like a madwoman, and emerged bloody,
    bruised and exhausted... but still standing. Of the ten who had fought in the melee, the
    only two who remained were Zaqim al-Farabad, a young lord from the eastern mountains, and
    Ibriya bint Raglan. The seneschal decreed them victors - though he looked as though he had
    bitten into a lemon when he spoke Ibriya's name - and declared that they were to fight in
    the final bout an hour after dusk, with the Mu'allim himself to judge. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Some say Fasair exiled the seneschal from his
    lands after that melee; others say he had him killed. Whatever the case, none of the
    combatants saw him again. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The sun set, and a great crowd formed about
    the fighting grounds. Every warrior who remained at Qush came to watch the final duel, as
    did many folk from the nearby town: word had spread that the Mu'allim was on the verge of
    losing his daughter to a woman, of all things. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>To the people's surprise, Fasair arrived at
    the grounds in a good mood, and was even smiling as he took the judge's seat. Folk looked
    at one another, amazed: wasn't he worried that the warrior who won the tournament might be
    the one least suitable to become his daughter's husband? Would that not be a scandal?
    Their only answer was that mysterious grin, which seemed to broaden as Zaqim and Ibriya
    strode forward to stand before him. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;You know the rules,&quot; he told them.
    &quot;You will fight until one remains, and that one shall earn Lashanda's hand.&quot; His
    gaze swept past Ibriya and rested firmly upon Zaqim. Then he rose from his chair,
    motioning to his servants, three of whom came forward with a bearing wine goblets: one
    carved of green malachite, one of blue lapis, and one of white onyx. &quot;But first a
    toast,&quot; the Mu'allim continued, &quot;to she for whom so many have fought and fallen.
    To my daughter.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>He took the onyx goblet from the nearest
    servant. Zaqim took the malachite, and Ibriya the lapis. They raised the cups in salute,
    and drank - all save Ibriya. &quot;I'm afraid I do not drink wine before battle,&quot; she
    told the Mu'allim, bowing, then poured it upon the ground. &quot;Instead I offer it as a
    libation, in tribute to your daughter's grace, my lord.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Those who were present that night say the
    grin on Fasair's face seemed to freeze then, but only for a moment. Then, with a nod to
    Ibriya, he resumed his seat, and the servants collected the goblets. To this day, no one
    is certain what was in the lapis cup, but many are sure they know nonetheless. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Begin,&quot; the Mu'allim said, no
    longer smiling at all. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Ibriya and Zaqim touched swords in salute,
    then began to trade blows. It went slowly at first, more a careful dance than a fight -
    especially strange after the vicious melee, earlier that day . They delved the depth of
    each other's skill, striking and parrying, noting strengths and seeking weaknesses. After
    a while of this they parted, weapons quivering in their hands, and began to circle each
    other, looking for the right opening. An unspoken signal passed between them, and they
    rushed at each other, blades awhirl. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Then the unthinkable happened. Zaqim
    al-Farabad tripped. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>A great cry rose from the crowd as he fell,
    his sword flying from his hand. Ibriya stood above him, her own weapon ready... and did
    nothing. &quot;Stand,&quot; she said. &quot;I will not win this tournament because of bad
    luck.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The crowd murmured, and the Mu'allim shifted
    in his seat as Zaqim rose. Ibriya stood by, waiting patiently, while he retrieved his
    sword. Only when he was armed again did the fight resume. Zaqim was humbled, however, and
    before long Ibriya's puissance drove him to his knees. He struggled to rise, and could
    not. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Hold,&quot; he told her. &quot;I am
    done. I yield - you are the victor of this match, and the tournament besides.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>A silence settled over the field, and once
    again Ibriya helped Zaqim rise. When he was on his feet, she went to stand before the
    Mu'allim, and dropped to one knee. She said nothing. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Fasair looked down upon her, at a loss.
    &quot;This cannot be,&quot; he said. &quot;I will not have it. You cannot wed my daughter,
    girl.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I do not wish to wed her,&quot; said
    Ibriya. &quot;But you did offer me her hand, and I would take it - not for myself, but for
    her. She is her own woman now, not yours to give like chattel. I have won her in fair
    combat, and so give her freedom. She, and no one else, shall choose her husband.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>There was great uproar at this, and the
    Mu'allim's face turned as dark as wine. &quot;This is unthinkable!&quot; he thundered.
    &quot;You have won this tournament through deceit and trickery, Ibriya bint Raglan! I
    disqualify you! Come forward, Zaqim al-Farabad.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>But Zaqim shook his head. &quot;No, my
    lord,&quot; he said. &quot;She defeated me fairly - you saw how, even when I fell, she did
    not strike me down. Ibriya is the victor, and I will not take her place.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>At this, the other warriors began to clash
    their swords against their shields and shout their approval. Fasair had eliminated the
    most dishonorable suitors before the games began, and none of those who had fought in the
    tournament wanted to sully their names by taking Lashanda to wife after meeting defeat. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;What I want of you is not so difficult,
    my lord,&quot; Ibriya declared. &quot;I only ask that you trust your daughter to make her
    own choice.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;And if she chooses poorly?&quot; the
    Mu'allim contended. &quot;She is my only child. What will become of my name?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;What would become of your name if it
    were learned you did not give the victor of this tournament her due?&quot; Ibriya
    returned. &quot;There are many people here, my lord. Word of such things has a habit of
    spreading.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Fasair thought on this, and knew he was
    beaten. His shoulders slumped. &quot;Very well,&quot; he relented. &quot;Lashanda shall
    marry the man of her choosing. But know this - if the husband she picks does not satisfy
    me, I will sire another heir, and grant my title and holdings to him.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Your judgment is fair, my lord,&quot;
    Ibriya said, and bowed. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>During the feast after the final battle,
    Lashanda bint Fasair appeared before the combatants, her head covered with a turban, as
    was custom for unwed ladies at the time. It was the first time most of them had seen her,
    and they were breathtaken by her grace and beauty. &quot;If I had known,&quot; many a man
    said to nodding comrades, &quot;I would have fought all the harder.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Lashanda sat at her father's right side
    throughout the feast; on his left sat Ibriya, for it was her right as victor to dine in
    that place of honor. The Mu'allim did not speak to her, or to anyone else: he only sat in
    stony silence and picked restlessly at his food. At last, when the servants cleared the
    last dishes away, he rose and turned to his daughter. &quot;My child,&quot; he told her,
    &quot;a victor has emerged from the field of battle to claim your hand.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>When Ibriya rose from her seat, Lashanda
    looked at her in pure, open-mouthed surprise, which turned to joy as Ibriya explained her
    wishes. Tearfully, the two women embraced. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;Now, my child,&quot; the Mu'allim
    pronounced, &quot;I ask you to choose: who will you wed?&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>Every man in the room leaned forward
    expectantly: warriors, courtiers, even the servants. Lashanda's lips parted in a radiant
    smile. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I choose no one,&quot; she said. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>The noise that rose shook the rafters of the
    great dining hall. Men shouted and pounded their fists upon tables. Fasair himself shook
    with rage. &quot;What!&quot; he bellowed. </small></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"><small>&quot;I choose no one,&quot; Lashanda
    repeated, unperturbed. &quot;I am still in mourning for Ulyush, and will not take a
    husband simply because a wedding is planned. In time, I will choose one - I have no
    intention of becoming a spinster, Father. But not while my love's body is still fresh in
