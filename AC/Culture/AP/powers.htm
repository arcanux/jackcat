	<p>
    <span lang="en-us">War had finally come to Freebooter Isle. The tropical 
	fortress resounded with the shrieks of combatants, the cries of the wounded, 
	and the ever-present hum of magical energy. Even as the keep’s foundation 
	stones shook with the magical energy unleashed by both besieging and 
	defending forces, two men sat in the deepest subterranean fortress levels 
	and enjoyed a quiet drink in the last few undisturbed moments they had.<br>
	<br>
	The two men were old friends, comrades in a long-ago war on another world, 
	and had not seen each other in years. Still, they seemed to be uninterested 
	in making conversation or trading stories about their adventures, as was the 
	usual conduct of two Aluvian veterans meeting over mugs of beer. Instead, 
	they both seemed to be more curious about listening to, and analyzing, the 
	sounds of battle that filtered down to them through the many passageways 
	that led to the surface from this room.<br>
	<br>
	There was one particularly deep, resounding boom from above, followed by a 
	moment of silence. Then, rising above the piteous cries of the wounded and 
	dying, there came the staccato beat of many boots, running down stone 
	corridors.<br>
	<br>
	The taller of the two men stood up and adjusted his weapon belt. He tipped 
	his cap to his companion. “That’ll be it, then,” he said. “The gate’s gone, 
	the flags will be up shortly I’m sure, and you’ll soon have some new 
	temporary business partners.”<br>
	<br>
	The other man, still seated, nodded his head. “Aye, I’m sure they’ll be down 
	here soon enough, demanding to confiscate me stocks and expectin’ the laird 
	o’ the castle treatment, just for clearin’ the front yard of all that scaly 
	trash.”<br>
	<br>
	His companion shrugged melodramatically. “You could give it up, MacTavish. 
	Just accept my offer. In the days to come, with so many people to play off 
	against each other, there will be riches beyond even your greediest dreams. 
	High risk, high reward, never boring. And you’re guaranteed an equity 
	position in the group, of course…”<br>
	<br>
	“’Tis a tempting offer, old friend,” MacTavish said. “But I’m too old to get 
	back into the game. Either that or I’ve gotten too soft here, working for 
	the Shrouds. I’m content to leave the risk to the young bucks now and just 
	take a percentage off what they bring in.” He stretched elaborately, popping 
	and cracking a few joints as he did so, as if to punctuate his point about 
	his advancing age.<br>
	<br>
	“What a pity,” the other man said as he stepped away from the table. “I 
	could have taught you the secrets to life and death, a secret known only to 
	a handful of people on this odd, troubled world. Knowledge I haven’t yet 
	shared with any of my eager acolytes.”<br>
	<br>
	MacTavish shook his head. “Even more reason to turn ye down. I’ve only just 
	gotten used to the lifestones… I know me limits. I know I’m just a smuggler 
	and a brigand, I know I’ve not got the courage or the craziness to take on 
	such power. In truth, I wonder what that power will do to yer own head,” he 
	said, chuckling lightly to try and take some of the sting or challenge out 
	of his words. When he looked around, though, his friend was gone. Even with 
	a smuggler’s keen senses, he’d not heard the man depart.<br>
	<br>
	All for the best, he reflected. He finished his beer. “Say hello to me 
	cousins, when ye see them again,” he muttered to the darkness as he 
	stood.There was a sound from the far end of the complex, the extended shriek 
	of a great door moving on rusted hinges. That was followed shortly by the 
	tromp of several boot heels as a small party entered the tunnels, presumably 
	a delegation from the victorious conquerors of Freebooter Isle, coming to 
	claim the entire island as their own. <br>
	<br>
	Out of the dark corridors stepped a man and a woman, at the head of a column 
	of soldiers in red and gold armor. The man was, by his form and bearing, an 
	old warrior and a commander of soldiers. He was Gharu’ndim, and his age and 
	scars marked him as a veteran of the Gharu’ndim resistance against the 
	Viamontian invasions back on their home world of Ispar. He was dressed in 
	elaborate plate armor, the color and ornamentation of which reflected his 
	rank as a senior officer of his Society. The giant mace in his right hand 
	still steamed from the blood and ichor of the Moarsmen he’d slain on his way 
	to clearing the path into the fortress.<br>
	<br>
	The woman was older, well into her elder years, and wearing a simple grey 
	robe that carried not a hint of decoration or even a badge of rank. Even so, 
	MacTavish recognized her as Nuhmudira, blood sorceress, former member of 
	Queen Elysa’s royal council. She was the warlord in charge of this group.She 
	carried herself with the same kind of arrogant self-assurance and cold-eyed 
	stare as that of his friend who’d just left walked… And no wonder, MacTavish 
	thought, as they both had mastered the same secrets to life and death… <br>
	<br>
	The old woman’s gaze swept the room until it settled upon him. “You are the 
	smuggler captain MacTavish?” she asked in an imperious voice that echoed the 
	underground chamber.<br>
	<br>
	“That’s me, milady,” MacTavish nodded pleasantly. “I’ll guess ye’re the 
	witch Nuhmudira that I’ve heard so much of.”<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira gazed blankly at him, not even bothering to acknowledge his 
	question, and pressed on with her own agenda. “Where is he?” <br>
	<br>
	“Ye’ll have to be more specific than that, milady. Where is who?” He was 
	being more insolent than he strictly needed to be, and that was probably 
	because he was still buoyed up by drinks with his famously arrogant and 
	self-assured friend. He sat back down and leaned back in his chair, kicking 
	his boot heels up on the table.<br>
	<br>
	“You know exactly who I mean,” the woman hissed. “The assassin, Oswald! He 
	was just in here, and he skulked out just before my troops could get down 
	here to capture him. Don’t try and lie to protect him, I can smell his stink 
	still in this room.” She looked to the soldier who stood next to 
	her.“General Tamiar, have your men secure the entire facility. I want no one 
	leaving or entering without my warrant.” <br>
	<br>
	The general bowed and turned to issue orders to the troops who’d entered 
	behind them. Nuhmudira stepped forward to confront MacTavish, who was still 
	lounging insolently in his chair. “Aye, me friend was down here. I see ye’re 
	already familiar with him. We were just downing a couple o’ brews and 
	talking about old times. We were in the wars together, back on Ispar, ye 
	see.”<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira sneered. “I know all about your war service with Oswald, knifing 
	Viamontian scouts in the back as they marched throughout your benighted 
	country of drunken ruffians and half-civilized brutes. I’m more interested 
	in why you’re treating with him now, placing yourself in a very precarious 
	position with my own occupying forces here.”<br>
	<br>
	MacTavish laughed. “Don’t think to threaten me like that, lady,” he 
	cautioned her. “I’m not some apprentice ye can order about and abuse. I’ve 
	got me own backers who look out for me, and I imagine we’ve got some wares 
	in our stocks that even yer own soldiers, well supplied as they must be, 
	will find useful. So it wouldn’t be in yer best interests to kill me and cut 
	off yer supply of such rare and wonderful items…”<br>
	<br>
	Nuhmudira stared down at the insolent smuggler with unconcealed contempt. 
	“My people have given me a briefing on why it is we should tolerate your 
	presence on this island, and they have even convinced me that you are too 
	useful to kill outright. But I will suffer none of your insolence, and if I 
	find even a hint that you are colluding with Oswald against me, I will bleed 
	you on an altar and bribe your masters to forget the inconvenience.Because 
	even they have a price, smuggler.” <br>
	<br>
	The surety of her words and the dangerous gleam in her eyes made MacTavish 
	sit up and adopt a slightly more polite posture. “Aye, I’ll keep it 
	respectful from here on out, milady,” he said. He was about to say more when 
	there was a series of explosions from outside and a rumble that shook the 
	walls of the underground redoubt. Shouted commands rang out from the 
	corridors as Nuhmudira’s soldiers ran back to the surface, alerting each 
	other to the presence of another group of invaders on Freebooter Isle. The 
	old woman barked a couple of commands at the soldiers nearest her, preparing 
	to head back up herself.<br>
	<br>
	MacTavish smiled broadly as he addressed Nuhmudira again. “As I was saying, 
	I’ll be respectful from here on out, and I look forward to a mutually 
	beneficial arrangement between yer Society and the trade consortium who 
	backs me… Provided ye can hold the island against yer own competition, 
	milady. Looks like there’s someone out there taking issue with yer plans for 
	domination. Worry not though, I’ll be here, ready to do business… with 
	whoever comes back down the corridor.”<br>
	<br>
	Furious, Nuhmudira trudged back up the tunnels to organize the defense of 
	the keep, even as the smuggler captain’s laughter echoed bitterly in her 
	ears.</span></p>

	<p><span lang="en-us">Greetings and welcome to the 100th content update for 
	Asheron’s Call! This is a special time for all of here at Turbine, having 
	reached this most incredible milestone. With this update we wanted to make 
	sure we did something special for the players. For the longest time, the one 
	thing we have been asked for was an Elder Game system. So with this update, 
	we are giving players the beginnings of that system. We are also giving our 
	PvP players something to fight over, with two new PvP controllable towns.
	<br>
	<br>
	The entire staff here at Turbine is proud to be able to release this update 
	to our players as a small token of our appreciation for everyone who has 
	heard the call over the years. So lets get in to all the new and exciting 
	things coming this month in Asheron’s Call!<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Societies are Coming!</b><br>
	A new faction system has been introduced with this update. Players wishing 
	to join one of the three new Societies will speak with one of the Society 
	Recruiters located in the capital cities of Dereth. The Celestial Hand will 
	be in Hebian-to, the Eldrytch Web will be in Cragstone, and the Radiant 
	Blood recruiter will be located in Zaikhal. Once players choose which 
	society they wish to join, they will begin their journey with the initiate 
	quests. The recruiters for each society will have all the details a player 
	will need to make their choice as to which side to join. When a player 
	completes the tasks set out by one of these recruiters, they will be well 
	rewarded and then instructed on how to claim their rewards. <br>
	<br>
	As part of this new system, some creatures will now be able to discern which 
	faction you and they are a part of. NPC’s who are part of your faction will 
	not attack you, however if you get too close to those belonging to another 
	faction, they will attack. These NPC’s can and will also attack each other, 
	if they come in contact. <br>
	<br>
	Deception and Assess Person now have another use for players involved in the 
	Faction system. All players who join a faction will display which faction 
	they belong to in their description panel. Based on a skill check of Assess 
	Person and Deception, some players may be able to “hide” which faction they 
	are a part of. This ability can be particularly useful in conjunction with 
	the new Land Control elements of the game. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>PvP Land Control</b><br>
	Two new PK towns have been added to the game. The first of these towns is 
	located just north of the Vesayen Isles, while the other town is located in 
	Northern Osteth, near the top of the Dereth mainland. Each town will start 
	out being held by a rogue faction of Moarsmen who will need to be defeated 
	in order to gain control of the town. Players who want to control one of 
	these towns will need to be player killers, however. Non-player killers will 
	be able to fight the NPCs of the town, but will not be able to claim control 
	of the town.<br>
	<br>
	Each town will have three banners that a PK must gain control of in order to 
	take the towns. Once all three of these banners are “controlled” by the same 
	faction, the town will be owned by that faction thus granting access to the 
	Black Market. This portal will only be useable by the members of the 
	controlling Society. <br>
	<br>
	The Black Markets are the provenance of the Shroud Cabals, unscrupulous 
	humans who have allied with the Virindi to exploit the factional chaos sown 
	by the three new Societies. Players may use the various Vendors and NPC’s in 
	the Black Markets to buy unique items. The Archmage and Shopkeep will also 
	have some nice extra items unavailable elsewhere. Some of the items players 
	will be able to purchase only in the Black markets will include XP gems 
	which can be purchased for MMD’s and level 8 dispel gems. There are some 
	other items of high value that these vendors will sell as well. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>New Loot</b><br>
	A new tier of loot is now available to players. This new tier of loot will 
	have a base wield requirement of level 150 and will have the potential to 
	generate with level 8 spells and or Epic level cantrips. There will also be 
	the chance that this new tier will be part of a greater set of armor. Pieces 
	which are part of a loot generated set will have a base level 180 
	requirement in order for players to equip them. Spell components for the 
	creation of level 8 spells will also be found in this new higher loot tier. 
	This new level of loot will mainly be found as rewards from questing, but 
	there will also be a chance for players to collect Mana Shards off some 
	landscape creatures, which they can then use to purchase keys to gain access 
	to this new tier of loot. In addition, we will be adding these keys to 
	several of our older quests in the coming months, starting in September. 
	Here is a breakdown of how players will get keys for the new tier of loot.

	<b>Level 8 Spells</b><br>
	Level 8 spells have been introduced into the game. To accommodate the desire 
	of some players to have a research system in the game while at the same time 
	accommodating others’ lack of desire to participate in a research system, we 
	have implemented a new system for learning level 8 spells. Players may 
	obtain quills, inks, and glyphs from our new highest tier treasure profiles 
	which may be used to craft spells. Quills may be combined with the new Mana 
	Scarab item (which is also the casting scarab for level 8 spells) in order 
	to craft infused quills. Infused quills may be crafted with inks to create a 
	combination of the two. This combination may then be crafted with a glyph to 
	create a level 8 scroll. <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	All components may also be traded or sold to a vendor, and the scrolls may 
	likewise be traded or sold to a vendor. We anticipate that those who wish to 
	participate in the system will enjoy it, while those who do not will be able 
	to obtain the scrolls they need through trading. It should also be noted 
	that not all spells exist at the level 8 tier – notably, we have elected not 
	to implement Creature Other buffs, Life Other buffs, Life Other imperil and 
	vulns, the self debuffs, and the item spell Defender. In addition, the Item 
	spell Blood Drinker 8 will appear only on treasure and will not be available 
	as a player-castable spell. If crafting something you expected to work 
	fails, very likely the spell simply does not exist for level 8. You will not 
	lose components upon failed crafting, and there is no skill associated with 
	level 8 spell crafting, so feel free to experiment safely with the various 
	components and see what you may accomplish!<br>
	<br>

	<b>New Areas<br>
	</b>A new landmass has appeared near the Vesayen Isles, known as Freebooter 
	Isle. While many of the landscape features will look familiar to the region, 
	many of the creatures that will appear on this new landmass will be changed 
	in some way. Creatures on this island will also have a chance of dropping 
	Mana Shards, which can be used to purchase keys for the new tier of loot. In 
	order to gain access to this new island, players will need to join one of 
	the new Societies. <br>
	<br>
	There is a new Moarsman city that has been discovered. Players will need to 
	discover how to access this new area. <br>
	<br>
	The Graveyard has been expanded to help accommodate the number of players 
	who will be hunting there for Society-related tasks.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	So there are just some of the things we have in store for Asheron's Call in 
	August. Please remember that along with everything listed here, there are 
	several new quests and exciting things going into the game for the August 
	event.</span><br>&nbsp;</font></p></td>
