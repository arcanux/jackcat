      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hate 
		rabbits! Furry little troublemakers.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear that Asheron is having an open 
		house. I think he's planning on sub-letting some of the rooms in his 
		castle. I believe he's calling them the Realaidain Suites. There's no 
		way I would live with him though. I bet he leaves portals lying all over 
		the place and forgets to leave the seat up. And oh yes, toilet seat 
		etiquette is important to a man with thirsts like mine.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tanada in the southern land bridge, 
		eh? I'm afraid that must be my fault. I told a certain furtive-looking 
		Sho gentlemen to invest in cliff-side beach real estate because in a few 
		years people will be killing for that property. How was I to know he was 
		a ninja master in disguise? Sound mind for investments though, those 
		Tanada.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The cute little ones grow up to be 
		dangerous vegetable thieves! The Hares of March are upon thee!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Me? No, I don't plan to pull any 
		pranks on April Fool's Day. I pulled a prank on Claude a few years ago 
		and it ended up leading to a Virindi takeover of Ayan Baqur. Or wait... 
		was that Claude's counter-prank on me? The fiendish airbag!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The graveyard in the Direlands? Why 
		would I visit such a place? All my dead loved ones are in Ispar. 
		Especially old Uncle Jurgrim. Some of my happiest childhood memories are 
		of Uncle Jurgrim. Oh, no, Uncle Jurgrim wasn't a blood relative. He 
		owned the local brewery, you see.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bah to all these ghost stories I've 
		been hearing. Next they'll be telling me that the ale fairy really does 
		exist.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Can't have a drink in peace without 
		some furry monstrosity hopping by!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those Falatacot, you've got to give 
		them credit. Asheron's been freed from their clutches but they're going 
		to carry on preparing their rituals like they've still got him? There's 
		something to be said for total insanity, I suppose. I wouldn't want to 
		have to get into a staring contest with one of those Matriarchs.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The fur was everywhere! The huge 
		biting teeth lunged for my throat! The hind legs tore at my chest! The 
		enormous ears beat me about the head mercilessly! That's when I 
		remembered my stout mug. With astonishing speed I swung the mug in a 
		death arc without spilling a drop. The hulking brute never new what 
		mighty hand had slain him. He lay upon the ground twitching while I 
		finished the stout that had been his undoing.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Stinkin' rabbit! Stouts are for Ulgrim!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm done with the Colosseum. I fought 
		everyone and everything they had. I even remember fight cows and 
		chickens or was it some kind of pink thing. I can't remember. What I do 
		know is that I'm the Super Ultimate Champion of the Colosseum.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Old Jaleh is dead. I think we should 
		elect a new leader for Ayan Baqur.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now let's see... who would make a good 
		leader?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, I couldn't!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Could I?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll do it! I will shoulder the heavy 
		burden of leadership.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;First law I pass? Free drinks for the 
		Mayor!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Surprisingly enough, pancakes and 
		stout don't mix so well. It pushes the stout's consistency past 
		'pleasantly doughy' into 'mushy and lumpy.' Though stout does go pretty 
		well with butter and syrup...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Since Asheron's ordeal on Bur, I've 
		taken to sleeping with one eye open. I don't doubt those Falatacot would 
		be interested in blood like mine. The magic they could unleash with my 
		blood would be incredibly smooth, dark, and refreshingly bitter, with 
		just a hint of oak and currant flavors. Mmmm, blood magic...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Asheron invited me to come to his 
		castle. Seems he needs someone who knows about spirits. Not the kind 
		that sneak up on you and go 'Boo!' either.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Easy guys, I drink my stout just like 
		the rest of you - one sip at a time. Except, once my mug's empty, I make 
		gold gromnies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you seen some of these people's 
		names? So... their mother was really a mule? So they can't reproduce 
		then? That's probably for the best.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wanna hear a poem, kid?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The birds they sing of Spring! 
		Spring!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The frogs they play in muck.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The bees continue buzzing buzzing!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The rabbits love to eat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;It's thirsty work, setting up shop back in 
		the desert.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I saw a cute little Ursuin Cub the 
		other day. I tried to pat it on the head. Cute little teeth on that cub. 
		See my cute little bite mark?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Why would restless spirits be walking 
		among graves in the Direlands by night? Ain't heard nothing about that 
		before this. You would think a necropolis would have been noticed before 
		this. Especially if those undead are as powerful as they are claiming.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm gonna need more cowbell!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Are you standing comfortably?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Then we'll begin...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Baker's man&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bake me a cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;As fast as you can.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, I've heard about the Tanada 
		appearing on the southern land bridge. Seems like they're spread out all 
		over the place, huh? I've seen this before. The Tanada are going to 
		squeeze out all the fine Aluvian, Gharu'ndim, and Viamontian assassin 
		families with their superior organization and low-ball rates!&quot;<br>
