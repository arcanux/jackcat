		the Pale is mucking about with Linvak Tukal again, eh? I know what he 
		wants. He's looking for the good luck stones I hid there. Well, someone 
		should tell him he can't have my lucky charms!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, I've already been to the 
		Empyrean Graveyard to trade in my coins for some of those new items. 
		I've greatly improved the acid resistance of my stomach, so I can eat as 
		many spicy snacks as I want while I drink.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;First it was bug glands, now they're 
		after Carenzi livers? I've sampled many strange brews in my time, 
		especially when Duke Raoul was running his experiments, but even I think 
		Carenzi livers would make for an awful beer flavor.&quot;<br>

		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you met this prodigal Tumerok 
		that Aerbax supposedly 'uplifted'? Gloomy bugger. Not very uplifted at 
		all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, undead sailor masks. All the 
		rage these days. Very fashionable. But I just find it's not very 
		flattering on my desert-tanned skin.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, I've heard that Aerbax 
		'uplifted' some Tumerok. I met the Tumerok in question. Shared a drink 
		with him. I tell you, Aerbax may have granted him incredible powers, but 
		he can't hold his liquor at all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I got myself one of those new masks, 
		but I'm not going to wear it in public. Last time I wore a mask that 
		made me look like an undead, I got propositioned by Lady Aerfalle, and 
		who needs the hassle? She doesn't take rejection kindly.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oswald passed through here just the 
		other day. I think he was looking for some new recruits. I told him I 
		couldn't work with him, though, because he doesn't let his apprentices 
		drink. Barbarism, I say! Barbarism!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim stumbles and mutters something unintelligible, &quot;Y syh uhla 
		tnaysat ra fyc y piddanvmo. Frah ra yfuga, ra hu muhkan ghaf ev ra fyc y 
		piddanvmo tnaysehk ra fyc y syh, un y syh fru ryt tnaysat ra fyc y 
		piddanvmo.&quot;<br>

		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Aerbax is coming for me, next. I'm 
		going to be the next prodigal he tries to uplift. I'm kind of looking 
		forward to it. I always felt like I could dominate the world, if only I 
		had the proper motivation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ugh! There's a diseased Carenzi liver 
		floating in this mug of stout!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ha! Made you look. Berkholt's 
		standards of cleanliness aren't quite that bad.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm gonna need more cowbell!&quot;<br>

		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yesterday, I almost drank a one that 
		was not cold. Good thing I caught myself in time!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, so I know what Oswent the Pale 
		is really after in Linvak Tukal, and it's not my lucky charms. He's 
		trying to find out what happened to Lord Kresovus's pet Mattekar, Balor. 
		I know what happened to Balor. Here's a hint. Stay away from Berkholt's 
		fried steak, okay?&quot;<br>
