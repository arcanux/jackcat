      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Poor 
		Elysa, it's like she's cursed. Every man she gets close to dies 
		horribly. I wonder if Asheron has anything to do with it... That's why I 
		had to send back that box of chocolates she sent me a while ago. I'm no 
		fool! Besides, romancng a Queen would surely interrupt my drinking 
		time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a hint, youngster. Get me 
		some stout, or I'll fix her up with you next.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I knew Kurth was going to go on over 
		to the other side. The man was loyal as a dog, but a starved dog will 
		turn feral eventually. I guess Elysa never had any pets.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ghosts and shadows cavorting on the 
		northeast coast? I'll believe it when I see it. Of course, I'm not 
		planning to get up there any time soon.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yeah, I think I'll change my 
		occupation. Wait, what do you mean there's no Tessera for Competitive 
		Drinking?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yanshi's been rebuilt, eh? Nice high 
		walls? That's all fine and good, but... How is the tavern?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Boy oh boy, another winter. I'm not 
		looking forward to this one. I'm not sure I can afford to heat my 
		mansion, what with the price of firewood going through the roof. I may 
		have to give up stout, or turn to a life of crime...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hrm. Definitely a life of crime.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A moment of silence for a brave and 
		noble man. We will not forget you, Antius.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I 
		see Nuhmudira's hand in some recent events. That woman! Imagine if I'd 
		married her like she asked me to. I'd probably have drunk myself to 
		death by now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If we build a new town I say we call 
		it Ulgrim's Ridge. Now that's a town name with style!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So it's true. Real death has returned 
		to Dereth. All right, I'm being overdramatic. Varicci's not the first to 
		discover that terrible power, but he's certainly the most... uncouth.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, have you heard the story about 
		that ghost at the ruined temple, way up on the northeast coast? Gives me 
		the creeps. It reminds me of my brothers, back on Ispar... No, wait, I 
		hated those guys. There were always filching my stout. I'm glad they're 
		not here!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear 
		itself. That, and weapons that can sever your lifestone connection. 
		That's something to fear, too.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Kurth willingly gave his allegiance to 
		Varicci, but there's no way he willingly got changed into one of those 
		monstrous things. Just goes to show what happens when you cooperate with 
		a tyrant. Keep that in mind, friend.&quot;<br>

		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've seen it all in my time on this 
		weird, wacky world. Nothing surprises me any more. Not even foul, 
		stinking betrayal. But don't listen to me. No one ever does.&quot;<br>
		<br>
