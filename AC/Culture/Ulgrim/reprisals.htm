      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Seems to 
		be some new group of sneaky people trying to stab there way to peace. 
		Trouble is, if they were really good at being sneaky, we wouldn't even 
		know about them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I got a visit from Mr. P. the other 
		day. Not a bad little chap for flightless aquatic bird. He gave me a 
		little pack doll of himself. I usually don't go in for self aggrandizing 
		merchandise, but it was pretty cute.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Boy oh boy, another winter. I'm not 
		looking forward to this one. I'm not sure I can afford to heat my 
		mansion, what with the price of firewood going through the roof. I may 
		have to give up stout, or turn to a life of mime...&quot; (Goes into this 
		emote mime bit, it's pretty funny)<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard that Varicci is pulling his 
		troops out of Yaraq. Apparently they didn't find any weapons of magic 
		disruption.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear that the remains of the last 
		Fiun woman have been stolen...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There are some very sick people in 
		this world.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's ridiculous even if there were a 
		Giant Tusker on Aphus Lassel he wouldn't be interested in our women. He 
		would be more interested in finding Giant Nanners and stomping on 
		people.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;But invariably we would trick him into 
		coming to Arwic and force him to put on a show with song and dance 
		numbers. He would get bitter and jaded and demand more nanners until he 
		was replaced with a cheaper even more giant Tusker. To make nanners meet 
		he would be forced to do dinner theater in a small pub in Kara, mourning 
		for his glory days as a Giant Tusker Song and Dance star.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So sad, why couldn't we just leave him 
		alone?! Why?!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah yes, the hatch. I told you it was 
		real, but you didn't believe me! No, even if I did know how to open it, 
		I wouldn't tell you now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hurt my feelings.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Think they know better than me.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;See how they like it when those violet 
		balls explode.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Maybe old Lunnum just decided to take 
		a break from the monotony of laying there on fire all the time. I've 
		seen other skeletons do much more surprising things in this world.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Moral issues aside, the problem with 
		Viamontian society is that it's unsustainable.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No civilization can last forever by 
		simply conquering those around them. As I see it there are only three 
		possible outcomes to this kind of expansionism.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;One, they eventually come up against a 
		more powerful enemy who will crush them. Two, they conquer until their 
		holdings are just too vast to control and the entire civilization 
		crumbles under its own bloated size. And three, they conquer everything 
		in reach and then the one thing that defines their civilization works 
		against them. They look inward at who to conquer, thus feeding on 
		themselves and eventually falling into many separate nations.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Uh...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;How many Viamontian's does it take to 
		bind to a lifestone?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Two. One to bind to the lifestone and 
		one to run off and tell Varicci about it insuring the first's death.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, I've been annoyed by something for 
		awhile. I think my backpack is infested with malicious Zefirs.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I keep placing my drinking supplies in 
		the front pockets of my backpack, but every morning when I wake up and 
		go to get a drink I find it's all been shifted back into my backpack.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tricksy little Zefirs! You'll pay for 
		this mild inconvenience!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I stand firmly behind any decisions 
		our Queen makes on the matter of dealing with the Viamont incursions. 
		I'm really hoping she decides to stomp on them though.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Epileptic spongemonkies? I never said 
		that!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I figured out a way to make a Really 
		dark lager using the Damaged Shadow Stones people are finding on the 
		Caul. It's a complicated process, but it makes a Lager with a kick to 
		its kick.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm not ready to share the recipe with 
		anyone yet. There are still some... side effects that I need to work 
		out.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim belches and his eyes flash red.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You will bow down to me and bring me 
		drinks in supplication weak one!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim shakes his head and his eyes return to normal.<br>
