      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey, 
      welcome to Ayan Baqur! Buy me a drink friend?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Fill me up a Beer Stein and I'll tell 
      you the story of how I tied to a broken lifestone.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wish I could take my sword with me. I'd 
      at the very least like to have it on my wall at home.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Where's everyone getting those slick 
      looking hats and suits from?&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'd look pretty good in one of those 
      getups don't you think?&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yeah, I'd be like Jack Diamond in the 
      &quot;Dark Mystery of the Stolen Stuff!&quot;&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a great story.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I saw a cute little Ursuin Cub the other 
      day. It tried to pat it on the head. Cute little teeth on that cub. See my 
      cute little bite mark?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating people 
      to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
      fascinating.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You the man!&quot;<br>
      You say, &quot;No, You the man!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're right, I am.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now I have the power of ten Uglrims!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;From hence forth I will be know as 
      Captain Stout! An amazing hero devoted to truth, justice and the pursuit 
      of free drinks.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wherever there are those in need of 
      help, I'll be there!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wherever there is a wrong to be righted, 
      I'll be there!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wherever a stout is left standing 
      unwatched, I will be there!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Easy guys, I drink my stout just like 
      the rest of you - one sip at a time. Except, once my mug's empty, I make 
      gold gromnies.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll stop what those Virindi are 
      planning. Just as soon as I figure out what that plan is.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey don't worry, I can handle it. I 
      drank something.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What's with the rabbit costume?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
      day.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he said 
      &quot;You, Gimpy! What kindof a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
      everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Maybe I should consider getting some of 
      those new attribute transfer gems.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I had a bad dream the other night. I was 
      in the ruins of some town and I couldn't get anyone to talk to me or give 
      me stout.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That wasn't the worst part of the dream 
      though. There were these horrible wormy things floating around and I was 
      terrified they would see me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in Candeth 
      Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me anytime! 
      Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tell Let me give you a bit of advice my 
      friend. Never look up a magician's robe, it ruins the surprise. Wait, or 
      was it a magician's sleeve?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear old Jaleh got killed. Aaminah 
      really looks as if she's broken up over it. I think we should elect a new 
      leader for Ayan Baqur.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now let's see... who would make a good 
      leader?&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, I couldn't!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Could I?&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll do it! I will shoulder the heavy 
      burden of leadership.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;First law I pass? Free drinks for the 
      Mayor!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's really good to be back in Ayan 
      Baqur. It hasn't changed all that much. The big difference is I see more 
      crazy fools running around killing each other than I used to. How can they 
      stand all the Vitae?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you noticed how dazed the people at 
      fishing holes look?&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Just try talking to one of them. You'll 
      be lucky if they even acknowledge you. More than likely they'll just stand 
      there casting and casting and casting.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They're Fishing Zombies! Fishing Zombies 
      I tells you!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;People were surprised that I changed my 
      portal recall spell. Hey, I warned people it would change. It's my spell 
      and I go where I like. Plus, I don't really trust Lifestone Recall 
      anymore...&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If you want to get to my island then 
      talk to the Drunken Madman, he knows the way.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Epileptic spongemonkies? I never said 
      that!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's time to kick it!&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's my new dance!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I visited Claude and Leopold the 
      yesterday.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Same old virindi. Still think that we 
      can't tell they aren't human.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked them to go cliff diving with me 
      tomorrow. Hehe.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I told them it was a traditional human 
      activity.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll just make sure they jump first.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I thought Mosswarts smelled bad, but 
      Burun smell like Tremendous Monouga feet. At least you know when they're 
      close.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bah! I told you so!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That white rabbit may look cute an 
      fluffy, but he's an abomination.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If we build a new town I say we call it 
      Ulgrim's Ridge. Now that's a town name with style!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know I'm glad my duplicates are 
      gone, but I've been thinking of the glorious things we could have 
      accomplished.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have formed an Fellowship of 
      Ulgrim, roaming the land looking for people to save and drinks to be 
      drunk.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have tried out a few of the 
      group spells I've been dabbling with.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have gone on fishing trips.&quot;<br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;...I miss those guys.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait in 
      case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
      discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
      dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
      while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
