      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Whoa, oh 
		no, there's Tanada over here, whoa, oh no, there's Tanada over there!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They asked me to help with the portal 
		summoning ritual. I said I'd help, too... Who wouldn't want to?&quot;<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Ulgrim pauses sadly.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Then they told me they were summoning 
		a portal to the world of Bur, not the world of Beer...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who keeps stealing my Bael'Zharon Lawn 
		Gnomes and sticking them in the Valley of Death?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You 
		won't catch me on Bur, no way. I've heard what it's like there and all 
		that swampy air is terrible for my delicate skin.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So they've almost figured out what 
		happened to Asheron, eh? That's good. Ben Ten was getting really 
		anxious. See, Asheron owed her a lot of money. They had some kind of bet 
		on how many pickled Olthoi eggs Asheron could eat, and he hurled after 
		the second one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I could sure use a mug of stout, kid. 
		I'll need it to get through the dark days ahead. No, I'm not talking 
		about winter, or the Tanada, or whatever the heck is going on with 
		Asheron. I'm talking about an enemy that the people of this town know 
		well...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've got a great new weapon. It's a 
		club. Or a tree trunk. Or maybe it's both. Either way, it looks pretty 
		snazzy hanging in my living room, but I'm not going to tell you where I 
		got it. You'll see, soon enough.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear tell Prince Borelean is fixing 
		to do some kind of mighty ritual. Borelean? The teenage prince? Come on, 
		now. When I was his age I couldn't concentrate on one thing long enough 
		to finish a mug of beer. This is going to end in crying, I can tell.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes, it seems that the Nanjou Shou-Jen 
		are prowling about in the mountains some more. I don't like the idea of 
		faceless assassins. I once knocked a ninja out and went through his 
		pockets to see if he had some identification. Turns out he was actually 
		a traveling knife salesman with some wrongheaded ideas about aggressive 
		marketing.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tell I've been saying it for years, 
		but no one ever listens to old drunk Ulgrim, even though I'm right every 
		time. The most perilous thing that we face, in this realm packed full of 
		peril, is not Shadows or the Tanada or Varicci or whatever the heck it 
		is that stole Asheron's underpants. No, the real enemy can be found 
		right here in this town. Beware, beware, their flashing blades, their 
		cloaks of air!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever stop to think about what 
		it is that drives me to drink? It's thirsty work, being a prophet that 
		no one listens to!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard about the statues of 
		Bael'Zharon showing up in the Valley of Death. Come on, now, people. 
		Worshipping Bael'Zharon is so five years ago. These days, the hip and 
		chic evil to sacrifice your soul to is Ulgrim'Zharon, the Stout Slayer. 
		I hear he accepts stout in lieu of souls, though.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Ulgrim sniffs you suspiciously, then seems to 
		relax.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah, okay, you're fine. No evil smells 
		on you. Either you've refrained from blood sacrifice, or you've found a 
		really premium brand of deodorant.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah, the unfamiliar sight of the bottom 
		of my mug. You know, the last time I saw the bottom of my mug, it was 
		when I was in the tavern at Arwic and I overheard that crook Ketnan 
		plotting something with one of his assistants, a little weasel of a man 
		named Dobblar. Watch out for Dobblar. He'd cut your throat if he thought 
		there was a clipped Pyreal in it for him. I don't know why I told you 
		about such a trivial thing, but I am sure it will be suspiciously 
		meaningful later.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know I'm glad my duplicates are 
		gone, but I've been thinking of the glorious things we could have 
		accomplished.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have formed an Fellowship of 
		Ulgrim, roaming the land looking for people to save and drinks to be 
		drunk.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have tried out a few of the 
		group spells I've been dabbling with.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have gone on fishing trips.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;...I miss those guys.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tell I have one word for you, my 
		friend, and it is going to change your life, so listen closely.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Mushrooms.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Are you standing comfortably?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Then we'll begin...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Baker's man&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bake me a cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;As fast as you can.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh sure, Hoshino Kei might tell you 
		that she's preparing those pillars for some kind of mighty ritual, but 
		I'll tell you what those pillars are really for: they are going to 
		become the world's largest beer still. Just you watch. Stout will pour 
		from the heavens when that ritual goes off.&quot;<br>
