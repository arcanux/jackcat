		a great fool to just blindly assume that there is some greater mystic 
		force tending the light at the end of the tunnel...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good to be home! Or, rather, 
		better to be here than dodging Eaters in Glenden Wood.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bring me some Stout already, meat 
		puppet! Oh, I can already tell I've spent too much time hanging out with 
		Claude.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Sorry, I'm not accepting cookies or 
		candy or anything weird like that any more. Made my belly ache. A man my 
		age has tender digestion, which is why I stick with the smooth, creamy 
		goodness of Stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Brrr, it's getting colder, even out 
		here in the desert. When winter's got its clammy grip on the world, the 
		best way to keep warm is with a nice mug of Stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a hint, kid. Get me some 
		Stout or I'll show you something about clammy grips. Oh, that didn't 
		come out right.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Would you believe, I was the one who 
		originally developed those new beer recipes that Duke Raoul is taking 
		credit for? Those Viamontians... not an original bone in their bodies, I 
		tell you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It takes a great fool to just blindly 
		assume that there is some greater mystic force tending the light at the 
		end of the tunnel...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh Harlune, that great bag of wind. A 
		day late and a Pyreal short, is what I have to say to him.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
      	<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What? Viamontians are in the Nexus 
		now? No! Not there! That's where I keep all my stuff! Curse you, Varicci! 
		Leave my porcelain ballerina collection alone!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's a sad thing, what's happening to 
		Glenden Wood. Pretty little town. I always liked the fragrant breeze 
		that rustles the leaves of the forest. Nothing else in Dereth smelled 
		like it. Too bad the air out there smells like burning corpses now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've seen it all in my time on this 
		weird, wacky world. Nothing surprises me any more. Not even foul, 
		stinking betrayal. But don't listen to me. No one ever does.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, I stopped at Vissidal Isle on the 
		way back. My little Merwart friends are doing quite well! Finally, one 
		of them set up a tavern! I just wish they'd stop worshipping me. It's so 
		hard to carry out a simple conversation with someone who drools all over 
		your boots.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, okay, Rand's developed some 
		powerful and tasty brews, and so has Duke Raoul. Based on... what, 
		Tusker Spit and Moarsmuck? Just you wait. I'm still working on my 
		Banderling Scalp Porter. Thick, yeasty, and filled with protein! It's 
		not just for breakfast any more!&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That white rabbit may look cute an 
		fluffy, but he's an abomination.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard people babbling that 
		there's no way Asheron would allow the Viamontians to raid his secret 
		cookie stash in Knorr. Why not? Maybe he doesn't like cookies any more. 
		My point is, a person's tastes and opinions can change. Except for mine. 
		Make mine a Stout!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Ale.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ale? I don't drink water unless I have 
		to.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;But, I might have to so I'll just hold 
		onto this.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good to be back in Ayan Baqur. 
		Things haven't changed much around here, have they? That devil Claude is 
		still up his old tricks.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, okay, Rand's developed some 
		powerful and tasty brews, and so has Duke Raoul. Based on... what, 
		Tusker Spit and Moarsmuck? Just you wait. I'm still working on my 
		Banderling Scalp Porter. Thick, yeasty, and filled with protein! It's 
		not just for breakfast any more!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm not sure how long I'll stick 
		around in Ayan Baqur. I may decide to visit Sanamar, just to see what 
		the big deal is. Or I could live among the Fiun for a while. Come to 
		think of it, living with those poor sad creatures would be too 
		depressing. I'd end up drinking too much.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, I stopped at Vissidal Isle on the

		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So what, exactly, does Varicci think 
		he's going to find in that secret wing of Knorr? From the way I heard it 
		all described, I bet he'll just find a pile of dirty paintings that 
		Asheron hides away when Elysa comes to visit.&quot;<br>
