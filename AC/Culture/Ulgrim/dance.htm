      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Terrible, 
		terrible tragedy what's going on with the Fiun and the corpse of Lunnum. 
		Of course, I know who actually stole her corpse, but I promised not to 
		tell, and I wouldn't betray Asheron like that.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oops! I told!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So fall has come, and with it the turn 
		of seasons... It's just not the same here as it was on Ispar, though. 
		Back on Ispar, when fall came around, I used to like to spend whole 
		weekends sitting around, eating liverwurst, drinking stout, and watching 
		gangs of hooligans beat each other to bloody pieces over an inflated pig 
		bladder. Ah, how I miss it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, here's what confuses me. You know 
		how there are always a lot of baby animals who show up in the spring? 
		How come we don't see a lot of really old and decrepit animals in the 
		fall? I mean, it stands to reason, right?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, I wouldn't be caught dead in the 
		Valley of Ruin. These are new suede boots. Do you have any idea what 
		Eater drool does to suede?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those Pumpkin Buffers are starting to 
		take hold in new towns. I tell you, if we don't do something now, those 
		things will be everywhere. It's a candy filled plague!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now, if they were filled with stout, 
		that would be a whole different story!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Seven years is a pretty long time, 
		isn't it? That's almost long enough to properly age a decent bottle of 
		whiskey. That is, if you like that kind of stuff. I tried to age a 
		bottle of stout for seven years once. I think I managed to kill it 
		before it escaped my house.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you gotten a look at the new 
		regalia? Pretty impressive, right? That's nothing compared to the 
		regalia I've been working on. I'm going to make a mask that looks like 
		the legendary Aluvian king, Osbork the Foamy. He invented stout, you 
		see. No, don't look at me like that. I know Aluvian history better than 
		you do, kid.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yeah, I've been to the Night Club. 
		They play too much breakbeat, though, and I'm more of a trance kind of 
		guy. What do you mean, you don't understand what that means? I guess 
		you're not hip enough to hang with old Ulgrim.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... Now you can slap the highest 
		available spells on alchemical gems. Because of Hyssop. Was that so 
		hard? Amateurs.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Sure sure sure, you can craft seventh 
		level spell gems using Hyssop to fortify the alchemical mixture, but 
		only us truly elite alchemists know that you can craft tenth-level spell 
		gems with stout. No, I'm not going to teach you the process. Too much of 
		a waste of stout. Everyone would start using it, there'd be a stout 
		shortage, and I'd end up having to kill people for their alchemy kits.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So you've heard about Leandra's 
		wonderful new chorizite formula? Yeah, made that same formula years ago, 
		except I used orichalcum. My formula made normal beer mugs larger on the 
		inside than on the outside. I only have the one sample left here. It 
		holds about 30 normal mugs of stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good that she's following in my 
		footsteps though, it shows she's very wise.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Pssst! I don't tell usually tell 
		anyone about this, but I am the Grand High Master of the Tanada clan! I 
		can throw a keg of stout in the air and cut it open, drinking every drop 
		before it hits the ground.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Seven years. That's a long time. I've 
		only been standing in this spot for... Six and a half years. Those first 
		few months, I was selling stout to thirsty tourists in the Vesayen 
		Isles. Business was pretty bad, because MacNiall and his little band of 
		cut-throats kept stealing from me.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I figured, if I wanted to improve 
		business, I better help free people from the Olthoi. And so here we 
		are.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;While I was gone, MacNiall's gang 
		stole the rest of my stout and defiled my store, but I helped free 
		humanity from insect slavery, so I've got that going for me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, I don't plan to go to the Night 
		Club. The music's too loud, there isn't any stout available, and I don't 
		get along with the owner.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who's the owner, you ask? Oswald is, 
		of course. What, you think he's just an assassin? He's forming a dance 
		group in his spare time. Oswald's quite the dancer. No one can pop and 
		lock like he can. And his Golemwalk is just... out of sight.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those new masks are really neat and 
		all, but you know who made the best masks on Ispar? Those fun 
		party-loving folk from Milantos. I remember they used to throw these big 
		parties where one guy would dress up as some enormous, bat-winged demon 
		with seven heads, and they'd sacrifice... No, wait, that wasn't a guy in 
		a costume. Never mind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The pumpkins have returned to Dereth, 
		eh? I suppose they haven't learned their lesson from last year, when we 
		ripped them from their safe and cozy patches, mutilated them with blunt 
		knives, dug out their guts, and stuck burning candles inside the gaping 
		sockets. Silly pumpkins.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Zombies! Did you see those Zombies run 
		past?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, maybe I just imagined it. It 
		seemed so vivid, though...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Pssst! I don't tell usually tell 
		anyone about this, but I am the Grand High Master of the Tanada clan! I 
		can throw a keg of stout in the air and cut it open, drinking every drop 
		before it hits the ground.&quot;<br>
