      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Spring's 
		come, hasn't it? That's great. My winter britches were getting a little 
		gamey, if you know what I mean. Now it's commando season!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Of course it was me who defeated 
		Aerbax! Haven't you realized by now that I'm the best in the world at 
		smacking around Virindi? I think that earned me a pint of stout, don't 
		you?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a hint, kid.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's a what in the graveyard now? A 
		jester? I'll believe it when I see it. And if you get me a pint, kid, 
		I'll be that much closer to being able to see your imaginary jester 
		friend.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't trust ghosts. Never have. Why 
		just the other day this ghost comes up to me and asks if I've seen her 
		husband. I could see right through her trickery. Heck, I could see right 
		through her. She was looking for a husband to bring to her grave. I'm 
		not falling for that one.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tanada House of Pancakes? Oh no, you 
		won't find me there. They don't cook the bacon the way I like. Come to 
		think of it, when's the last time I had a proper piece of bacon? Not 
		since Ispar...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Dang it! Did no one think to bring 
		pigs to Dereth?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, yes, Rytheran's up to his old 
		tricks. And by old tricks, I mean some kind of new tricks that he picked 
		up from a very old book.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Sure, Aerbax is in retreat, but I just 
		know he'll be back to cause trouble in a few hundred years... Mark my 
		words.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The snows have receded, the baby 
		animals are back, and the snowmen have gone away again. Oh, I hated the 
		snowmen, with their beady black eyes, and the smug looks on their 
		faces!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever notice how ghosts are all 
		kind of whiny? I can understand being a bit upset about being dead and 
		all, but really, who wants to hear them groan on and on? If I was a 
		ghost I'd set up some sort of spirit hotline so you could talk to your 
		departed loved ones. And I'd make it pricey, say 500 pyreals for the 
		first minute and 50 pyreals for every 5 seconds after that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Are you standing comfortably?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Then we'll begin...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Patty Cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Baker's man&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bake me a cake&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;As fast as you can.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;It's thirsty work, setting up shop back in 
		the desert.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim pauses.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Maggie the Jackcat?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I have heard some weird names, but...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What were your parents thinking?!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey, kid.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Catch.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Clean, Dry Towel.<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Here, roll these three dice six times. 
		That's right, we're rolling one out for my old pal Gygax the Gamer. 
		Known him since our days at university on Ispar. We spent a lot of late 
		nights together working on a funny little game. Figured we'd 
		revolutionize the world with it. I kinda feel like I wouldn't be here 
		without him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You didn't hear it from me, but the 
		ley lines have gone all wobbly because someone read a few indiscreet 
		passages from the Book of Eibhil.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll stop what those Virindi are 
		planning. Just as soon as I figure out what that plan is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey don't worry, I can handle it. I 
		drank something.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What's with the rabbit costume?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever notice how ghosts are all 
		kind of whiny? I can understand being a bit upset about being dead and 
		all, but really, who wants to hear them groan on and on? If I was a
