      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hoshino 
		Kei? She's such a stick in the mud. You know what she said when I 
		offered her stout? 'I must focus on my studies, honorable Ulgrim,' she 
		said. Bah. Stout helps with studying, didn't anyone ever tell her?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That new Tanada Champion didn't send 
		me an invitation to do battle! It's pretty obvious why. He knows I'd 
		take his pretty sword and spank him with it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ha! I know all about those ley line 
		raiders. They're missing out on the most powerful node in all of Dereth. 
		It's right beneath me. Yep, on this very spot. The ground here is just 
		saturated with geomantically active mana. Or, wait, is that beer? I get 
		the two confused sometimes.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You don't have to tell me that Aerbax 
		is up to something awful with all this memory manipulation he's been 
		doing. He almost made me forget how much I love stout. And for that, 
		there can be no forgiveness.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ardry? Is that you, lad? No? What a 
		disappointment. Ardry's a good lad. Always buys me a mug of stout when 
		he comes to visit. That was a hint, kid.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard about that floating complex 
		in the Obsidian Plains. Was I right or was I right about Aerbax? He 
		won't be content just running experiments on Mosswarts and Banderlings, 
		no. I was saying he'd eventually muster himself up and come after our 
		stout reserves, and so he has. But no one ever listens to my warnings, 
		no.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Of course Asheron's left his tower 
		again and left the nitty-gritty to some poor gormless sap. Too much of 
		an aristocrat to muck about with us commoners, I guess. He's intimidated 
		by me, you know. I could see it in his eyes when I beat him in that 
		drinking contest.&quot;<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You won't see me heading into the 
		Trial of the Deep. Oh, Pwyll's moldy bones, no. Tentacle stains are even 
		harder to wash out than beer stains, and not nearly as fun to acquire.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;This is the worst part of the year, I 
		think. It's cold, all the bladderball teams have gone home for the 
		winter, and... What, you've never heard of bladderball? Fascinating 
		game. Very popular among the Banderlings. I like to have a stout and a 
		bit of sausage and watch them tear each other apart.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Good stuff! Better than drinking 
		blood, of course.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, I know that Tanada Champion. What 
		was his name again? Coconut or something? He tried to challenge me to a 
		beer-drinking contest! Of course he couldn't defeat me. I made him cry. 
		Pretty sad sight, to see a drunk ninja crying big blubbery tears over a 
		half-empty mug of stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard people talking about a 
		magical well, but if all that's in it is water, it can't be very 
		magical, can it?&quot;<br>
