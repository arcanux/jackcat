      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">UUlgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;It's thirsty 
		work, setting up shop back in the desert.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I remember the defeat of the Olthoi 
		Queen as if it were yesterday. Seriously, I think someone went and slew 
		her again the other day on Marae Lassel. What, you thought I meant the 
		one that Elysa slew? That's just crazy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear the Dopeslayer has returned. 
		No, not the Hopeslayer - the Dopeslayer. You see, if a person's a dope, 
		this being comes and...deals...with them. Overall, I think this is a 
		good thing.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;'Tis the season to be jolly...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What do you mean it's not the season 
		to be jolly anymore? It's always the season to be jolly!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My buddy Asheron is throwing a party 
		at his castle. You have to come. It's just off the coast of Eastham.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There goes the neighborhood!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;First we get that ugly cut up Lugian 
		hanging around outside of town and now we get those drum thumping 
		Tumeroks up on the hill.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Nighttime is drinky-sleepy-time, not 
		drummy-screamy-time!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Turns out Asheron wasn't throwing a 
		party at his place. Seems I confused his asking for parties of heroes to 
		come to his castle with a heroic party at his castle.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh well, I figure I may show up 
		anyway. Have you ever noticed how tightly wound up he can get? He 
		desperately needs a little relaxation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I think Aerbax is going about his 
		scheme to conquer the world all wrong. What ol' Plasterhead 
		Tentaclehands should do is start charging admission to all these dream 
		quest things. Seriously - Charge an M note to witness the first war 
		council of the Fourth Sending! Or maybe charge a C note to watch Elysa 
		and Thorsten flirt! He'd become rich, and...well, I guess we couldn't 
		even say we'd have our memories at that point, but it's not as if I have 
		mine right now anyways. Who are you?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I think that we've got our priorities 
		screwed up. I mean, alchemists are good and all, but why can't they work 
		on better beer recipes. Can't you just imagine what it'd be like if 
		Janier al-Evv teamed up with some master brewers and made an infused 
		stout? Throwing phials is all well and good, but I want to breathe on my 
		enemy to weaken them. Or get them drunk, all the same to me - most 
		Banderlings could use with getting drunk and relaxing.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you noticed how dazed the people 
		at fishing holes look?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Just try talking to one of them. 
		You'll be lucky if they even acknowledge you. More than likely they'll 
		just stand there casting and casting and casting.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They're Fishing Zombies! Fishing 
		Zombies I tells you!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Aerbax is coming for me, next. I'm 
		going to be the next prodigal he tries to uplift. I'm kind of looking 
		forward to it. I always felt like I could dominate the world, if only I 
		had the proper motivation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm an old fool. That Tumerok Game 
		Warden, Jalvalarareralalala, came down and apologized for making all 
		that noise the other night.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Seems they have a yearly celebration 
		of the Hunt and they assumed we all knew about it.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Heck, If I'd known it was a party I 
		would have brought the stout! I promised him to mix up some Hunstman's 
		Vigor for the party next year. Hehe!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Anyway, he asked me to pass along the 
		fact that he's looking for skilled hunters to help with the 'Dire 
		Champion' creatures that have been causing so many deaths around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Go talk to him, he's a decent fellow.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know what the Virindi call a Royal 
		Atlatl with Deadly Darts?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A Royal Atlatl with Deadly Darts. The 
		Virindi aren't all that creative.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you know my face is on the Soul 
		Staff?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yup, I'm immortalized! It's the third 
		face down. Some people may claim it's the guy who created the staff, but 
		he's nobody and I'm famous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Turns out Asheron wasn't throwing a 
		party at his place. Seems I confused his asking for parties of heroes to 
		come to his castle with a heroic party at his castle.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh well, I figure I may show up 
		anyway. Have you ever noticed how tightly wound up he can get? He 
		desperately needs a little relaxation.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bah! I told you so!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Easy guys, I drink my stout just like 
		the rest of you - one sip at a time. Except, once my mug's empty, I make 
		gold gromnies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll never forget how you helped me 
		out with that whole broken wand problem. I really owe you one.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You deserve that... Fred. Fredrina? 
		Bah, whatever.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You the man!&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;No, You the man!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're right, I am.&quot;<br>
