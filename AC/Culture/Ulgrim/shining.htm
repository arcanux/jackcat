		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Got any eeps?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Drudges, you can't live with them and 
		you can't kill 'em. Wait, strike that, you can kill them. And I suppose 
		if you had some house rules laid down you could live with a Drudge, I 
		mean look at that lady in Shoushi. Although I bet a Drudge never 
		remembers to put the seat down.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm sure glad to hear that Iian di 
		Alduressa figured out his armorcrafting techniques. I always thought he 
		was a good fellow. Polite, unassuming, but a trifle high strung.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Spring has sprung, and the world is 
		new. The snow has gone, now so should you.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Seriously, go away, you bother me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So Varicci commissioned those Runed 
		Weapons from some mysterious Silveran smiths. Fancy fancy. Then he went 
		to all the trouble to drag them through the portals, getting ready to 
		distribute them to his elite troops... And poof, they're gone.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Couldn't happen to a nicer homicidal 
		despot.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you ever noticed how the animals 
		only have babies at a certain time every year? I think it may have 
		something to do with the magical fields of the world suppressing certain 
		urges, but something opposes the fields come Spring, allowing nature to 
		do its thing.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It might explain the strange 
		attraction I have for Drudges every Spring. Heh, just kidding...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, okay, I'll accept this mug of 
		stout, but don't think it will get me to intercede on your behalf with 
		the Mukkir. Nope, I'm just a concerned citizen.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Runed Weapons? I surely didn't steal 
		them from Varicci's vaults. Everyone has to try and blame everything on 
		me!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard tell of a source of power 
		hidden away somewhere and guarded by deadly guard type things. I'm 
		worried this item might fall into the wrong hands. If you find this 
		power bring it to me and I will use it to brew the most powerful... I 
		mean I will keep it safe. Yes, safe and sound.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That rotten rabbit is having more evil 
		spawn! It must be mating with the lesser rabbits or perhaps it's 
		asexual. I wouldn't be surprised by anything that furry menace does. We 
		must stop the White Rabbit from perpetuating its dark line.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear that we may already have failed 
		and that last year a Son of Pooky was born who escaped the Spring 
		Cleaners! Go hunt him down and save all of us from the White Menace! 
		Go!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We'll miss you, Big Willie. Nope, I'm 
		not going to explain what that means.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I was going to write a song for my 
		lady about what a dangerous guy I am to love. I was going to call it 
		&quot;Ring of Stout.&quot; Want to hear the first lines?&quot; <br>
		<font color="#D6D2DD">Ulgrim clears his voice and prepares to sing.
		</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Love... is a boozy thing...&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;And it makes... a foamy ring...&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What do you think so far?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;People have been finding their way 
		into an entire nest of Mukkir.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Good luck to them. I'll be right here, 
		just me and my Dark Lager.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Good to know there was on Viamontian 
		in Dereth smart enough to actually learn something from outside his own, 
		elitist bloodline.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim looks thoughtful for a moment. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Perhaps I can teach him the Noble Art 
		of Stout...&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's a sneaky Aluvian right here in 
		Ayan Baqur who is looking for people who can't tell the difference 
		between foolishness and bravery. Darned Aluvians!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who, me? Aluvian? Nope, I am one of 
		the famed mounted warriors of Souia-Vey. Hey, where's my horse? Who 
		stole my horse?!?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's someone named Melaverre in 
		Sanamar who's asking people to do some perfectly horrific things. Worse, 
		even, than drinking stale Stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll never forget how you helped me 
		out with that whole broken wand problem. I really owe you one.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... here.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You deserve that... Fred. Fredrina? 
		Bah, whatever.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Rowr.&quot;<br>
