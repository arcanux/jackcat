      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, 
		some days I really miss my old pet from Ispar. I had a cat. I named him 
		Wobbles. Boy, could that cat drink.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, we split Grael into three 
		different aspects? I was the one who suggested it to those fellows over 
		there. See, it happened to me once, very disconcerting.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There were all these Ulgrims running 
		around and drinking up all the stout and lager! What a nightmare. I'm 
		glad the only one left is my good friend whatshisname back at my house. 
		I hate to think of other aspects of me hidden around the world.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Old Hanzu over there has been doing a 
		pretty brisk business recently. All sorts of weird people toting bones 
		and guts and various nasty parts of creatures have been visiting him. I 
		think he's been dabbling in the dark arts. You know, Folk Art.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh boy, Mi Krau-Li finally improved 
		his jitte again, eh? What were the odds? Somehow I suspect that daft old 
		skeleton is going to be hammering away in his little workshop a thousand 
		years after I've become hops-scented dust in the wind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;Aw! None Left!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Uninscription Stones? Sweet Mattekar 
		Milk that's something!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can finally uninscribe my underwear. 
		I am so sick of seeing Property of Asheron Realadain every morning.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you 
		see Oswald? He was just here! He said he was going to have to start 
		killing people again because, ever since he started helping us out with 
		that whole Grael thing, people stopped being afraid of him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I think I saw one of the Drudge Flying 
		Machines float overhead the other day. Strange thing though. It was full 
		of Sclavus. They must have stolen it or something. Sclavus on a Drudge 
		Flying Machine, now I've seen everything.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You should have seen it! Grael flew 
		into town on these giant wings of billowing shadow. Then the Town Criers 
		took off to warn the queen and he started stalking around looking for 
		someone to eat. I cast a magical disruption spell on him which held him 
		for a few seconds, but then he was free and bearing down on me with 
		ferocious strength. His long talons gleaming with the blood of his 
		latest victims. I dodged to the left, then to the right at the last 
		moment and sent him hurdling into the side of the building. As he spun 
		around I splashed Tusker Spit Ale in his eyes and then started pummeling 
		him with my mug until he finally took to the air cursing my power and 
		resolve.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;By the time the militia showed up he 
		was nearly out of sight.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;This town owes me a debt of gratitude. 
		I was thinking a statue of me over there would be nice.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Nice to see the sun has come back out. 
		It was getting a bit depressing there for awhile. I can't believe that 
		someone powerful enough to realign the planets could be stupid enough to 
		fall for the old 'divide and conquer' technique. I guess he wasn't awake 
		when Gaerlan got his comeuppance.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I found a fossilized Gromnatross turd 
		the other day! I'm going to make a bow out of it!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can finally uninscribe my underwear. 
		I am so sick of seeing Property of Asheron Realadain every morning.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's nice that Varicci and Elysa were 
		able to defeat Grael by pooling their resources. It reminds me of an 
		important lesson I learned when I was a kid. My sister and I both liked 
		to sneak mugs of ale from the tavern in our town. When we learned to 
		work together, we were able to steal whole kegs. See, I should be a 
		teacher somewhere.&quot;<br>
