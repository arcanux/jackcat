		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ugh! I hope there aren't any Moarsman 
		raids on this town. The smell of them alone is enough to curdle my 
		beer.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, I really should do something 
		about that keep down on the beach... later.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes yes, Asheron planted some 
		Blight-filtering pyramids at each of the threatened nodes and is 
		protecting the realm... How boring! Wake me when he's perfected his 
		distillery.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So what made the Drudges stop raiding 
		Cragstone? I'll tell you. They finally got the last barrel of ale out of 
		there. Cheeky little drunkards. I can't stand a drunk. I hate the 
		competition.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Falatacot Patriarchs? I think you got 
		that wrong, kid. There's no such thing as a Falatacot Patriarch. No, 
		seriously, pull the other one, it's got bells on.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I could have stopped the Drudge raids 
		on Cragstone months ago, if only I'd known! It turns out they were there 
		looking for some of my good luck charms. You know how superstitious 
		Drudges can be. But then... oh, never mind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Inkitan? Ves? Siabot? How do those 
		cultists get their names - from bowls of alphabet soup?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, okay, I'll fess up, there is 
		such a thing as Falatacot patriarchs. It just means something really 
		strange is going on with those awful awful creatures. Like they're 
		having some kind of leadership crisis. If only they had accepted my 
		leadership when they had the chance, but no, they decided to go off and 
		worship some tentacles in the swamp.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes, I've heard about the infestation 
		of Blighted creatures in various regions. Blighted Golems on Aerlinthe, 
		and Armoredillos in the frozen north... The worst is the Blight that 
		struck the fields where the local brewer's barley and hops are grown.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The beer's just gotten darker and more 
		bitter, with a distressing tendency to burn through the bottom of the 
		mug. Gives me heartburn something fierce! Still, it's beer...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll stop what those Virindi are 
		planning. Just as soon as I figure out what that plan is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey don't worry, I can handle it. I 
		drank something.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant is too busy to accept gifts right now.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What's with the rabbit costume?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Blighted Pyreal Golems on 
		Aerlinthe are some pretty fierce creatures, but they've got nothing on 
		the legendary Blighted Penguins! What? You say there aren't any Blighted 
		Penguins? Well then how did the little buggers get so rude in the first 
		place?&quot;<br>
