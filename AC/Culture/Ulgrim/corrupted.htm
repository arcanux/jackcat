      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Death 
		comes to visit all of us, my benighted little friend. But I'm the only 
		one with booze strong enough to make him forget why he came to visit.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's a ghostly little girl in the 
		Direlands Graveyard, did you hear? Why's she hanging out in the 
		graveyard? Only dead people there, and dead people are no fun.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'd go and find out what's going on 
		with those Olthoi in the northeast myself, but acid burns and puncture 
		wounds really mess with my wardrobe.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've figured out who's behind all the 
		agitation among the Banderlings, Tuskers, Olthoi, Drudges, and whatnot. 
		It's Queen Elysa herself! She's getting bored without extradimensional 
		demons to fight!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Is summer over yet? Gosh it's hot. You 
		know what's good about being this hot? Gives you an excuse to drink! Not 
		that I need an excuse, mind you. No, all I need is a kind pilgrim to 
		fetch me a mug of Berkholt's stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a hint, kid. Not the 
		brightest wand in the pile, are you?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know who I got a postcard from the 
		other day? Aerbax! I'd almost forgotten about him! I wonder what he's 
		been up to lately? He's pretty polite and cordial, for an amoral butcher 
		and vivisectionist.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a U!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme an L!&quot;<br>
		[General] &lt;Tell:IIDString:0:Chef Wubbie&gt;Chef Wubbie&lt;\Tell&gt; says, &quot;my 
		glands are swollen&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a GR!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a I!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a M!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What does that spell?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Right! Grumli, my invisible pet 
		chicken. Have you seen him around?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I keep calling out his name with the 
		letters all jumbled, just the way he likes it, but he hasn't come home.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, if you happen to trip over him 
		let me know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Mudmouth's up to what, now? Honestly, 
		I bet he'd settle down if someone would be kind enough to get him a 
		banana daiquiri. No, wait, what's a banana daiquiri? I don't think those 
		have been invented here yet.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, sometimes I kind of miss 
		Claude.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Don't tell anyone I said that or I'll 
		turn you into a mug of stout and drink you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Don't bother me! I'm working on a new 
		grenade design. When it hits its target, it bursts and turns everything 
		in a six-yard radius into stout. Next I'll work on one that turns 
		everything into salted pretzels.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You the man!&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;No, You the man!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're right, I am.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
		day.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he 
		said &quot;You, Gimpy! What kind of a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
		everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I guess he didn't realize that I had 
		used a few attribute transfer gems... What a gimp.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever wonder where the eggs we 
		eat come from? And what about the supposed chicken our cooks make? I 
		don't eat either of them... just in case.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
