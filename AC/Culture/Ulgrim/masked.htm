		Glands?!? The Arcanum is collecting Bug Glands?!?!?! I wonder if they 
		can be used in making stout... Ulgrim's Bug-Juice Stout. Sounds perfect 
		for the costume festival.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know what's good about the chilly 
		nights of fall? Makes it acceptable to drink warm beer. Normally, I'd 
		dump the mug over your head if you brought me a warm stout. But somehow 
		it's okay in the fall.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was a hint, kid. Get me a stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A Pumpkin Golem in the Colosseum now? 
		Preposterous. I refuse to believe it. What's the reward for defeating 
		it? A bag full of candy?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My buddy Claude's back!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Uh, I mean...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I pledge to remain eternally vigilant 
		against the Virindi threat.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I need to get another storage chest. 
		I've collected so many Colosseum Coins that I just can't store them 
		anymore. Maybe I'll melt them down and have them cast into a statue of 
		me...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It can say 'Ultimate Champion of the 
		Colosseum', Yes, I think that will do nicely.&quot;<br>

		Ulgrim stumbles and mutters something unintelligible, &quot;Y syh uhla 
		tnaysat ra fyc y piddanvmo. Frah ra yfuga, ra hu muhkan ghaf ev ra fyc y 
		piddanvmo tnaysehk ra fyc y syh, un y syh fru ryt tnaysat ra fyc y

		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've seen this year's masks, and I'll 
		tell you something. Masks aren't the same as they were when I first 
		settled here, no. In my day, you'd settle for a balloon-shaped Mosswart 
		head mask, and you'd be darn happy for it! Now there are the cows, and 
		the undead sailors, and Mukkir... Doesn't anyone want to be a Mosswart 
		any more?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Happy Anniversary! Where are you 
		planning to spend it? In the Night Club, bumping and grinding with the 
		Tusker dancers? I'll be curled up at home with a good book and a mug of 
		mulled stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Want to know the secret to beating the 
		Colosseum?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim looks around to make sure no one else is listening.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Give the Master Arbitrator some Molten 
		Pyreal Stout with some Colosseum Coins in it for flavor. He loves that 
		stuff and he gets so drunk he'll reward you anything you want.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Boy, there's no telling what kind of 
		bizarre costumes you can make out of critter parts! Why, one year, there 
		was a guy who made a costume out of some part he'd scavenged off the 
		carcass of the Tremendous Monouga. I think he said he was dressed as a 
		sausage.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you ever had a nightmare where it 
		felt like adventurers were killing you over and over, hunting for that 
		one trophy that they knew you sometimes carry with you? I mean, I know I 
		went through that a few years ago, but it feels like it's started again. 
		Maybe I should lay off the stout? Nah...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I went to visit the fortune shrine 
		today. Want to hear my fortune?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant is too busy to accept gifts right now.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You will fall into a very deep hole 
		and your broken body will slowly be devoured by the foul things that 
		reside in the lightless places.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That didn't sound so good.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My lucky numbers are 6,6,6.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Go inside Claude's head? Not for all 
		the stout in Ispar, my friend. That's a lesson you should remember. No 
		telling when that might come in useful.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I was writing spell on this scroll&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;An ah shallow shark was like Grrrr 
		Grrrr Grrrr&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;And then, like half my scroll was 
		gone... and I was like...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Unnhh?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It devoured my spell... was a really 
		good spell and then I had to write it again and I had to do it fast, so 
		it wasn't as good...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;a bummer.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm Ulgrim and I'm a mage.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Zombies are raiding?!? Where? Oh, not 
		here? Why did you think I'd care then, kid? I almost spilled my stout. 
		Then you'd definitely have a problem on your hands.&quot;<br>
		<br>

		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll never forget how you helped me 
		out with that whole broken wand problem. I really owe you one.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You deserve that... Fred. Fredrina? 
		Bah, whatever.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Someone's taken out a bounty on 
		Virindi, eh? I wonder how much Claude is worth. Maybe I could bring his 
		head in and get enough money to start my own brewery. I'd even name a 
		brew after the smiling rascal. 'Inscrutable Git Ale' or something like 
		that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Someone's been staying at my house. I 
		noticed my porridge was eaten and my bed was all mussed up. If I catch 
		him he'll be sorry.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm gonna need more cowbell!&quot;<br>
