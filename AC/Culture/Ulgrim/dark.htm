      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Taken a 
		trip to the Direlands Graveyard lately? Things are quite hopping over 
		there. And no, I don't mean the jumping rats. Don't tell me there's no 
		such thing as jumping rats. Famous last words.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You can go ahead and investiage that 
		Artifex Collegium on the Singularity Caul if you want. There's nothing 
		there but a bunch of dried-up old coots afraid to climb out of their 
		ivory tower and enjoy life! No, wait, that was my old university back on 
		Ispar. Truth be told I have no idea what's going on in the Artifex 
		Collegium here.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's something going on with the 
		Harbinger. I invited her to come to tea yesterday and she never sent me 
		a response. Needless to say I was surprised. Not because she didn't 
		come, but because she usually sends a couple of her elemental children 
		to 'destroy that fool once and for all.' It's this kind of joke we have 
		going. I'm not sure what could have her so distracted.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, don't ask me what's causing all 
		that ruckus on the Singularity Caul. It's actually my fault. I tried to 
		set up a brewery there in some old abandoned Virindi research facility. 
		Turns out it wasn't so abandoned!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Don't ask me about that old child 
		Solange out on the Singularity Caul. Not quite right in the head, if you 
		ask me. I blame all the booze.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard about some awful things 
		going on in the Shadow Orphanage on the Singularity Caul. Yep, they've 
		been spanking those kids. Not that they don't deserve it, fallen little 
		thralls of the Hopeslayer that they are.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, for all the terrible things 
		I used to say about Claude, he never crashed property values as badly as 
		Aerbax has. Just goes to show, sometimes you should count your 
		blessings.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Malrin in Sanamar's got a real problem 
		with those golems, eh? Seems kind of obsessed. I have to pity people who 
		get so obsessed with something that they can't let go and get on with 
		their lives. Yes, I live here, right by this bar, waiting for strangers 
		to buy me stout. What's your point, kid? Get me another stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know as well as I do that Aerbax 
		is the one who's fooling around with all that stuff on the Singularity 
		Caul. Why he can't be satisfied with the extradimensional powers that 
		nature gave him, I'll never know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, that mage over near the 
		Singularity Caul has finally seen fit to upgrade his inventory. Good 
		thing, too, or I was about to take my business elsewhere. Like here, for 
		more stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim's eyes focus on a distant point and a dreamy expression falls 
		over he face.<br>
		Ulgrim blinks. Then he notices you for the first time.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I speak through the most easily 
		affected mind now. The surgeon has visited me with a dark purpose. He 
		stole from me a portion of that which made me. I sense another drawing 
		the blood of the world. Your misplaced fear over my existence may find 
		more fertile ground in this new host.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Don't happen to have a bit of stout 
		with you friend?&quot;<br>
