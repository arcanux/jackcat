      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard 
		the Nutty Prophesier has been spouting a bunch of crazy warnings about 
		something evil coming and eating us all.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Normally, I would take Jester warnings 
		with a heaping mug full of mad cow milk.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That was before I started having the 
		nightmares again. I can't remember them, but... they werent good.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you heard about those changes in 
		the Green Mire Grave? I remember my first adventures in there, when I 
		was new to Dereth... I used to stand on the other side of locked doors 
		and make people tell me knock-knock jokes to open the door for them...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That all ended when Oswald came 
		through. He wouldn't tell me a joke, so I told him to pick the lock by 
		himself. I do believe he shivved me in the kidney, right through the 
		door lock!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh ho, so people are seeking out 
		Rytheran for what he knows about the book, are they? They should have 
		come to me. I already know all about that book. Read it years ago. 
		Here's a hint: everyone dies in the end.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, Lilitha just came through 
		here, looking for her bow. Heh, okay, I'm pulling your leg. Lilitha 
		hasn't been here in ages. Not since I stole her bow after that one night 
		of drunken carousing. She was a fine warrior, but she couldn't hold her 
		liquor.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Falatacot asked the Empyreans for 
		help. Seriously, what were they thinking...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Exactly! They weren't!&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah, 
		summer. My favorite time of year, when the tourists flock to Ayan Baqur 
		for the cool ocean breezes and the periodic invasions of hordes of 
		hostile creatures. I like to barbecue in the summer. But the last time I 
		did, Aerbax came and stole all the stout. I'll never forgive him for 
		that.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;People chasing after Rytheran are 
		barking up the wrong tree, I think. He doesn't know any more than we do. 
		As far as I can tell, he doesn't even remember what happened with that 
		book! He socked all that knowledge away into a mnemosyne, and then 
		forgot where the mnemosyne was! I think he lost it somewhere in his 
		study.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, if you want the secrets of that 
		big fancy skin-bound book that everyone's so hot and bothered about, 
		you'll have to find Rytheran's housekeeper.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are rumors that a pair of strange scouts 
		have taken up residence in the Bloodless town of Wai Jhou, seeking 
		information on the undead lord known as Rytheran.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, I really admire that Harlune 
		fellow. I mean, he taught Celcynd everything he knows, right? And 
		Celcynd spends all of his time in a bar drinking! Clearly, Harlune is 
		wise.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;All right, I'll try again. Here, take 
		this to the Jester. It's my finest home brew.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Ulgrim's Home Brew.<br>
		Ulgrim crosses his arms and smiles proudly.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Once he tries that he won't be able to 
		get enough of the stuff and I can finally make peace with the nutter. 
		Maybe even have him over for a few drinks. I never said he wasn't 
		interesting, just a Sira-loonie.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Doesn't it feel like something's in 
		the air? There's a certain smell, a smell of things changing, alignments 
		shifting. Like a new island could arise out of the sea, or some chunk of 
		land could fall off of Dereth... It smells like impending catastrophe.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, wait, that's just my socks.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's time to kick it!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's my new dance!&quot;<br>
