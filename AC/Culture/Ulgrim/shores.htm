		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They say that Grael has three aspects: 
		ale, lager, and stout. No, wait, that's not right...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;With all of these new islands coming 
		up all of the time, I've begun my quest to find the Ale Crystal, so I 
		may consume it, and raise the Isle of Stout... Mmmmmm... Stout...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Where is Asheron? He's always shown up 
		to every shindig the Shadows have thrown before. I expect he wants to be 
		fashionably late.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard that Asheron beat Grael at a 
		game of Yanshi Hold 'Em. He had a full house.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No wait, that doesn't sound right.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard that Grael gave Asheron a free 
		trip to the Halaetan Islands, all expenses paid.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hmmm... I know it was Grael, Asheron, 
		trip and house. You figure it out!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Grael can go ride a Sleech for all I 
		care. Just because some waterlogged bug puppet with a pointy stick flops 
		up on our shores doesn't make me scared.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those Pathwardens are nice folk, to be 
		giving away all that expensive armor for new arrivals. When I was a new 
		arrival here, do you know what I got? A poke in the eye from an Olthoi 
		pincer!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ummm, isn't it about time for the 
		animals to stop making more baby animals? I mean, sure, they're cute and 
		all, but someone should teach these critters about abstinence.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, another isle has been raised from 
		the bottom of the sea. Don't you people have enough to do without 
		ruining the view on all of those coastal properties?!? They were 
		expensive you know!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, I guess there might be supplies 
		for even stronger draughts of Dark Ale there, so it may not be a 
		complete loss...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's nothing I like more than a 
		fine summer rain interspersed with Shadows and creatures from the dark 
		depths attempting to steal my life's blood.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ahhh!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've got my own suit of Relic Armor, 
		you know. It's made from highly magical beer mugs that date back to the 
		dawn of the Roulean Empire.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Where is Asheron? He's always shown up 
		to every shindig the Shadows have thrown before. I expect he wants to be 
		fashionably late.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some 
		monsters get stronger, some monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' 
		Ulgrim says when the health is down, fire is raining from the sky and 
		monsters are clawing at his throat.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, 
		&quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the wand.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear that several high ranking 
		members of the Order of the Tome have been attempting to limit the news 
		that our Town Criers are allowed to cry. All in order to sell more 
		books. I demand Crier Neultrality! Freedom to shout whatever stupid 
		words we want to!&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Barble Hoggenda 
		Floopdi!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those Pathwardens are nice folk, to be 
		giving away all that expensive armor for new arrivals. When I was a new 
		arrival here, do you know what I got? A poke in the eye from an Olthoi 
		pincer!&quot; </font>
      </p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't 
		think we'll be seeing much of Count Dardante any more. Well, we will, 
		but we won't. That makes sense, when you think about it.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I saw a cute little Ursuin Cub the 
		other day. I tried to pat it on the head. Cute little teeth on that cub. 
		See my cute little bite mark?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard about those crystals that the 
		Black Knight and Dardante were sending people out to get. Sounds like 
		fun! I would have gone hunting too, except that old Berkholt had one of 
		his kegs burst, and I had to help him keep all the stout from drying up. 
		That was some hard work!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Keep an eye out for dark storm clouds 
		in the skies. Some friends of mine...&quot; Ulgrim glances at you, as if 
		daring you to speak. Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ahem! Some 
		friends of mine have said a horde of Shadows appeared in one of the 
		storms and nearly killed their party.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, 
		&quot;They say that's why they lost all the stout they were bringing for me. 
		Such a tragic story.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I heard that Asheron beat Grael at a 
		game of Yanshi Hold 'Em. He had a full house.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant 
		tells you, &quot;No wait, that doesn't sound right.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant 
		tells you, &quot;I heard that Grael gave Asheron a free trip to the Halaetan 
		Islands, all expenses paid.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hmmm... I 
		know it was Grael, Asheron, trip and house. You figure it out!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear Banderlings and Drudges have 
		started a game called Skullball. They kick a human skull around a field 
		attempting to kick it into a Carenzi Mound. I'm thinking the Banderling 
		Brawlers have a slightly better chance of winning the Skull Cup against 
		the Drudges Dancers this year. I can't wait to see the game! I always 
		bring extra stout and sausages to these events.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I kept telling Elysa we should cover 
		up those Spire Holes. &quot;Cover up those Spire Holes,&quot; I said. But did she 
		listen? Nope, nobody listens to old Ulgrim.&quot; Ulgrim sighs. Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No great thinker is ever appreciated within their 
		own time.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know I'm glad my duplicates are 
		gone, but I've been thinking of the glorious things we could have 
		accomplished.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have formed an 
		Fellowship of Ulgrim, roaming the land looking for people to save and 
		drinks to be drunk.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have 
		tried out a few of the group spells I've been dabbling with.&quot; Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We could have gone on fishing trips.&quot; Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant tells you, &quot;...I miss those guys.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've drunk things you people wouldn't 
		believe.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Burning Mana Blasts off the 
		coast of the Caul.&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've watched pint 
		glasses glitter in the ephemeral light of portal space.&quot; Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant tells you, &quot;All these memories will be lost, like stout from 
		a keg...&quot; Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Time to drink.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Grael better not attack my house! I 
		have a secret defense system.&quot; Ulgrim looks around to make sure no one 
		is eavesdropping. He gestures rudely at the Jeweler. Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant says, &quot;Oy! Mind your own business Daryam!&quot; Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If a Shadow sets foot on my island he will be 
		assaulted by an elite force of Keg Golems. Those shadows would be in for 
		a delicious, foamy death. Too good for 'em!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, I'm serious about the three 
		aspects of Grael. Maiden, Mother, Crone? Was that it? No, not that 
		either. I bet more stout will help me remember.&quot; <br>
