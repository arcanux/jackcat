      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Can I ask 
		you a favor? I had a store of my best steins broken into by those 
		troublesome golems on my island. If you find the time could you go and 
		try to recover one for me?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Empyrean Trinkets? Oh you mean those 
		balls. I didn't know that Empyreans had balls. I wouldn't call them 
		trinkets even if they did.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The newfound ease of getting items to 
		keep my rent paid has given me all this extra free time. I decided to 
		spend my spare time drinking. I know, I know, you were hoping I'd go 
		into acting or writing or something, but I always say, do what you love, 
		so here I am.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So there are new masks available. I 
		hear tell that the Viamontians are making their own masks. I was going 
		to make a mask that looks like Varicci, but I ran out of material before 
		I could finish the forehead. Boy, that guy's got a huge forehead. It's 
		big enough to call a fivehead.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yeah, I heard that people are visiting 
		the Mines of Despair again, and I'm a little curious to check it out, 
		but that name is so depressing. Come around again when they've been 
		renamed the Mines of Stout or the Mines of Very Rare Ribeye Steak With 
		Horseradish on the Side, and then I'll swing by for a visit.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, the Night Club shut its doors 
		again. I hear tell that the Virindi in the next dungeon over called in 
		enough noise complaints to get their portal license revoked. That's just 
		what I heard, though.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I noticed this really handsome woman 
		in one of the Explorer outfits talking to Berkholt the other day. She 
		was kind of blurry the way people get midday, but I could tell she was a 
		looker. Anyway she passed him some notes and hurried out of town heading 
		east. I'm pretty sure she was into me. She avoided looking at me when 
		she left and that's a sure sign. Lots of ladies love the Ulgrim.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Tanada compare their fighting 
		style to the movement of air, and refer to their methods of fighting 
		with melee weapons, bows, and magic as the Ways of Storms, Wind, and 
		Breath. I have an air-based fighting style that is guaranteed to defeat 
		theirs, but I am too much of a gentleman to use it in front of you.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ha! Yeah, go ahead, challenge me to a 
		drinking contest, I dare ya! I drank Ben Ten under the table, and she 
		cheated! I drank Oswald under the table, even though his beer kept 
		disappearing mysteriously without him having seemed to drink it! I beat 
		them all, and I'll beat you, you overeager whippersnapper!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Brrrr! It's getting cooler every day 
		now. Does the sky look kind of snowy to you? Nah, not yet, soon though. 
		I can feel it in my rumticker. That's my weather predicting bone.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear tell there was an Undead 
		impersonating me, and saying all sorts of outrageous, off-the-wall 
		things. The nerve! Sullying my hard-earned reputation for truth like 
		that! I'm so offended, it's driven me to drink!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If you can find one of my stolen 
		Steins on those meddlesome golems on my island I'll allow you to 
		challenge me to a Drinking Contest. Don't expect to win though, I've 
		been training for quite some time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Where in the world is Asheron 
		Realadain? I think he might have gone to some resort world where he can 
		get away from flying demons bent on world domination. Yep, I bet he's 
		got his feet up and he's sipping some sweet native brew. Hey! Why didn't 
		he ask me to go with him?!!! I thought we were buddies! I hope he gets a 
		sunburn.&quot;<br>
