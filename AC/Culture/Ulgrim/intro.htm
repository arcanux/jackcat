      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;More 
		monsters rising up out of the sea? Now they're all over the place! I 
		know they're looking for me. Darned sea monsters, they're always after 
		me lucky stout!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, secret societies abound in 
		Ispar. I myself am a proud member of the Order of the Full, Frosty Mug 
		of Stout. That's a hint, kid. Bring me some stout and I'll show you our 
		secret handshake.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I was going to offer you a reward, 
		like Queen Elysa's done. Then I realized I can't be as generous as she 
		is because I'm dirt poor and I have to beg even for life's necessities, 
		like frosty pints of stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If you ask me, it's a day late and a 
		pyreal short for those Royal Guards to change the bounties they were 
		offering on the Burun Kings. Weren't these problems taken care of years 
		ago? I mean, how silly is it, to think that people can just keep going 
		back and killing the same poor dumb frog over and over again? Oh, wait, 
		never mind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Why did someone release that crazy, 
		lunatic nut-ball in the Graveyard? It wasn't you, was it? Because I'd 
		hit you so hard, your face would recall to Ispar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I know all about those secret 
		societies. They're all Virindi front operations. You'll see. You'll do 
		all they want you to do, risk your life, sell your soul, and then, at 
		the end, when you get inducted into the final circle of secrets, the 
		Virindi will come out, turn your brains to applesauce, and slurp it 
		right out of your skull with a straw.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;How do I know this? You don't want to 
		know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah, you're a lifesaver, kid. Wish I 
		could offer you rewards like Queen Elysa's done. I'll tell you what, 
		I'll give you something if you pull my... No, wait, you probably 
		wouldn't consider that a reward.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, I decided to share a mug of my 
		personal stock with the newcomer in the Graveyard.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Turns out that the Jester doesn't 
		drink. Says he never touches the stuff. Says he has to keep his guard up 
		against the &quot;lalalalalas,&quot; whatever those are.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Jester, the absolutely hands down 
		nuttiest Siraluun I've ever met, said that drink clouds his perception!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know what I think. I think he's 
		afraid it would do the opposite. I think if it quelled the crazy for a 
		bit he would have to face everything he's done.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've said it before and I'll say it 
		again. I don't trust someone who won't sit and have a drink and a chat 
		with you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever wonder where the eggs we 
		eat come from? And what about the supposed chicken our cooks make? I 
		don't eat either of them... just in case.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ho ho ho, I know what the Jester is 
		about, finally. The cards, the long-lost lover, everything... He's just 
		some fool who got in over his head with the casino bosses. Yep, I think 
		we can blame Monty the Munificent and his cohorts for this. Oh, you say 
		the Jester's been around for thousands of years longer than the casinos 
		have been? Well, maybe I know something you don't know, kid. Nobody 
		likes a know-it-all.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yeah, so I did tell you I'd show 
		you our secret society's secret handshake if you brought me some 
		stout... Well, uh, you don't have enough hands, kid. It's a very complex 
		handshake.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So you've heard about Leandra's 
		wonderful new chorizite formula? Yeah, made that same formula years ago, 
		except I used orichalcum. My formula made normal beer mugs larger on the 
		inside than on the outside. I only have the one sample left here. It 
		holds about 30 normal mugs of stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good that she's following in my 
		footsteps though, it shows she's very wise.&quot;<br>
