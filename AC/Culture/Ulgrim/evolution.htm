      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, don't 
		ask me about those new Champions at the Colosseum. Not a one of them can 
		out-drink me. That Golem, especially, can't hold his booze.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, there's something funny going 
		on with those Olthoi who've taken over the mountains and valleys in the 
		northeast. They're clearly up to something. Near as I can figure, based 
		on the information my Merwart spies have gathered, they are trying to 
		build a raft.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It turns out that Drudges had a 
		purpose besides simple thievery in their extended raid on Cragstone. 
		Those supplies they've been stealing, especially the food, are meant for 
		a gigantic brewery they've been building in the middle of the 
		Singularity Caul.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes, I've heard about trouble over on 
		that island run by Tuskers. It's my fault, I know. I tossed them a 
		golden banana labeled 'For the Ookiest,' and things have been boiling 
		over ever since.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Alchemy grenades? Ha! I know all the 
		alchemists are patting themselves on the back over this development, but 
		honestly I could easily achieve the same effect by simply tossing a mug 
		of stale stout at someone. So thick... so yeasty...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, I'm starting to think those 
		Tanada have been quiet for too long... Not like a ninja clan to just 
		kind of vanish into the darkness like that. Usually they're much more 
		ostentatious, right?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I have it! I know what's going on! All 
		the kidnappings, the strange power struggles erupting among all the 
		humanoid races... It's a plot! Someone is plotting to blow up Cragstone 
		and use the crisis to unite Elysa and Varicci's people under one 
		mysterious ruler! Save the Monouga, save the world!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Berkholt told me that drinking water 
		tastes kind of strange these days. I was curious, so I tried some. He's 
		right. The water doesn't taste right. It tastes like rot. Like the 
		source of the water's been fouled up by some corrupting force. I'd be 
		pretty worried if I actually drank the stuff on a regular basis.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If you're nice to me, I'll supply you 
		with the recipe for a super potent alchemy phial that will render your 
		enemies stunned and helpless! You'll have to gather the ingredients for 
		me, too. Let's see, what were they? Water, yeast, grain, hops... Hey, 
		are you writing this down?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;It's thirsty work, setting up shop back in 
		the desert.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh yes, my nephew Ardry told me about 
		some strange facility where Drudges have been enslaved to bring food to 
		feed some giant beast... Ardry wasn't able to get close enough to tell 
		what kind of monster they're feeding down there, but I think I know what 
		it is. I think that's where my pet Armoredillo, Fluffy, ended up after I 
		tried to feed him that mysterious black ball...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You the man!&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;No, You the man!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're right, I am.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you heard about this mysterious 
		'Master' who's one of the most highly ranked champions in the Colosseum? 
		He's a pupil of mine, from when I was teaching self-defense in that 
		Phoenix Temple in the Sho lands of Ispar. He used to be the wimpiest kid 
		in the class. Even the kitchen boys used to push him around. Glad to see 
		he's finally learned to defend himself, the poor boy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I saw a cute little Ursuin Cub the 
		other day. I tried to pat it on the head. Cute little teeth on that cub. 
		See my cute little bite mark?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I went to visit the fortune shrine 
		today. Want to hear my fortune?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You will fall into a very deep hole 
		and your broken body will slowly be devoured by the foul things that 
		reside in the lightless places.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That didn't sound so good.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My lucky numbers are 6,6,6.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you been to see my old friend 
		Oolutanga lately? He seems a little different these days. At first I 
		just assumed he was hitting the fermented coconut milk a little harder 
		than he normally does, but he didn't smell like booze. He smelled 
		like... applesauce.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll stop what those Virindi are 
		planning. Just as soon as I figure out what that plan is.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey don't worry, I can handle it. I 
		drank something.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What's with the rabbit costume?&quot; <br>
