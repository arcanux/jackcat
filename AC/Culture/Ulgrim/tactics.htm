      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Mad 
		Bull creates and uses a weapon that severs your tie to a Lifestone, and 
		Elysa suddenly starts taking an interesting in protecting Dryreach?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Better late than never, I guess.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I wish the Rat King would visit my 
		basement and organize the stupid mice down there. If he could get them 
		to brew me beer I would bring them as much cheese as they could eat.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, don't bother with Hassha out in 
		the swamp. That old snake just wants someone to read it some bedtime 
		stories.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gaerlan really kicked the white rabbit 
		when he started messing with this world's essence. He may yet get his 
		wish to rid the world of us.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I found a rare item! It's the Planar 
		Mug of Everlasting Stout. You see, it is actually a rift in the fabric 
		of the universe, in the bottom of a beer mug and directly connected to 
		the Plane of Stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, wait. I just dreamed that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So Elysa has established formal 
		diplomatic relations with Silyun. That's probably a good idea. Maybe she 
		can take up with that Duke, if he ever drags himself out of wherever 
		he's been hiding. Varicci already wants to kill him, so he'd probably be 
		a safe person for Elysa to date.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who do you think would win in a fight? 
		The dirty, inbred, feebleminded and war mongering Varicci or the caring, 
		noble, heroic, brilliant and beautiful Queen Elysa? Just make an 
		impartial decision.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I thought so.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Want to see my one-eyed Pack 
		Banderling?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you heard Tyrell Marsan's war 
		stories?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They're all hogwash. Everyone knows 
		that the best weapon against Tumeroks is stout!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, okay, I'll accept this mug of 
		Stout, but don't think it will get me to intercede on your behalf with 
		the Virindi. Nope, I'm just a concerned citizen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		</font>Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I went to school with Varicci, 
		did you know that? He wasn't very popular. I could rattle off a list of 
		the titles that were bestowed upon him in those awkward years, but then 
		I know the next black blade would be coming for me.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're on mine...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll stop what those Virindi are 
		planning. Just as soon as I figure out what that plan is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Hey don't worry, I can handle it. I 
		drank something.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What's with the rabbit costume?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim stumbles and mutters something unintelligible, &quot;Y syh uhla 
		tnaysat ra fyc y piddanvmo. Frah ra yfuga, ra hu muhkan ghaf ev ra fyc y 
		piddanvmo tnaysehk ra fyc y syh, un y syh fru ryt tnaysat ra fyc y 
		piddanvmo.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm gonna need more cowbell!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, we think it's a good thing to have 
		weapons that access the same dark powers that almost destroyed the world 
		during the Shadow Invasions? Well, I'm not going to use them. In fact, 
		I'm going to design a whole new suite of weapons that draw their powers 
		from the rich and delicious power of Stout!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Remember how my backpack is infested 
		with malicious Zefirs? Well, I guess they felt bad for all the tricks 
		they've been playing on me, because they left me a present in my 
		backpack. I got a rare Zumamaphone. Boy is it great. I can't remember 
		the last time I had so much fun. Those Pack Zefirs are all right by me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've got multiple titles too. Ulgrim 
		the Archmage, Master of Time and Space, Leader of the Virindi 
		Resistance, Master Tinkerer, Seer of Truths, Lord of the Jewelry, 
		Supreme Peppermint Cook, Celebrations Advisor to the Queen, Chess 
		Grandmaster, the Shadow Tested, Virindi Regulator, Beer Lord, and Keeper 
		of the Hatch.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, okay, I'll accept this mug of 
		Stout, but don't think it will get me to intercede on your behalf with 
		the Virindi. Nope, I'm just a concerned citizen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Someone's off severing Lifestone ties 
		and still no word from Asheron, eh? I knew I shouldn't have showed him 
		that resort brochure. He's probably sipping fruity drinks from coconuts 
		with little umbrellas in them while we're left here to freeze.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I decided to show Ciandra how to 
		properly fix those stones she was helping with last month. I needed an 
		improved ingredient for my Extra Dark Stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Dryreach, it's been under Tumerok 
		attack for years...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now she does something direct to 
		protect it?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I wonder if this means the tavern 
		there will start serving a wider selection of Stout...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I could use more Stout...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Good Stuff!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Whoa!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's why I don't do that.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
		day.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he 
		said &quot;You, Gimpy! What kind of a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
		everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I guess he didn't realize that I had 
		used a few attribute transfer gems... What a gimp.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You the man!&quot;<br>
		You say, &quot;No, You the man!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You're right, I am.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you know my face is on the Soul 
		Staff?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yup, I'm immortalized! It's the third 
		face down. Some people may claim it's the guy who created the staff, but 
		he's nobody and I'm famous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I saw a cute little Ursuin Cub the 
		other day. I tried to pat it on the head. Cute little teeth on that cub. 
		See my cute little bite mark?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you noticed how dazed the people 
		at fishing holes look?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Just try talking to one of them. 
		You'll be lucky if they even acknowledge you. More than likely they'll 
		just stand there casting and casting and casting.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They're Fishing Zombies! Fishing 
		Zombies I tells you!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I went to visit the fortune shrine 
		today. Want to hear my fortune?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You will fall into a very deep hole 
		and your broken body will slowly be devoured by the foul things that 
		reside in the lightless places.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That didn't sound so good.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My lucky numbers are 6,6,6.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those mansions I've seen are pretty 
		nice, but nowhere near as nice as the house I built for myself. I used 
		to have a fortress on Asheron's Island, but the neighbors were too 
		loud.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		</font>Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If we build a new town I say we 
		call it <br>
		Ulgrim's Ridge. Now that's a town name with style!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know what the Virindi call a Royal 
		Atlatl with Deadly Darts?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A Royal Atlatl with Deadly Darts. The 
		Virindi aren't all that creative.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear if you lick a Burun you can see 
		all sorts of cool stuff.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So you've heard about Leandra's 
		wonderful new chorizite formula? Yeah, made that same formula years ago, 
		except I used orichalcum. My formula made normal beer mugs larger on the 
		inside than on the outside. I only have the one sample left here. It 
		holds about 30 normal mugs of stout.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's good that she's following in my 
		footsteps though, it shows she's very wise.&quot;<br>
