		Asheron, am sooo dating Elysa! I mean common! She's great! Why wouldn't 
		I?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Asheron is thirsty little mortal! 
		Bring me drink!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Asheron 1&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Olthoi 1597346&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bring me some stout and we'll have a 
		nice chat. Bring me two stouts and I'll tell you whatever you want to 
		know. Bring me three stouts and I'll make some stuff up for you.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Look at me. My name is Asheron. I am 
		mighty and noble and I play with the lives of other people to do what I 
		deem to be the right thing.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That's 
		right. It's that time of year again. Give me some peppermint and I'll 
		make you a culinary delight to entice your taste buds to ecstasy.&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That 
		Ulgrim is one of the finest upstanding members of Dereth. He brings a 
		new meaning to the term humble. Yes, he is one amazing individual. Full 
		of the milk of human kindness and ever giving of his time and skill. I 
		wish I, Asheron, could be more like Ulgrim.&quot; <br>

		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, have you been to that island that

		Did those Merwarts have anything to drink yet?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the

		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Do you like my mask?&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Elysa got mad at me, but I say 
		imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Plus, people tend to give 
		me all sorts of things when they think I'm Asheron.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;That Varicci guys a jerk! That's 
		right, I went there.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Want to play a fun Festival trick? Go 
		visit the Little Guy on my island. I made a bet with him and he lost. 
		It's worth going just to see him dressed up.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;When you get there try giving him a Wi 
		Stamp. No really, it's hilarious.&quot;<br>

		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's that time of year again. Every 
		one runs around in costumes pretending to be monsters or other people 
		while eating huge amounts of candy and drinking any number of delicious 
		drinks. I love the Festival Season! I say we rename Glenden Wood to 
		Festival Town and I shall rule over it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've created a new drink. It's red and 
		has a real kick to it. I'm thinking about naming it after that cow they 
		have in Sanamar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
		day.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he 
		said &quot;You, Gimpy! What kind of a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
		everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I guess he didn't realize that I had 
		used a few attribute transfer gems... What a gimp.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I have my own special chat channel! 
		It's called UlgrimChat and I'm the only one who's allowed to speak on 
		it. Everyone I want to invite can hear me though.&quot;<br>
		<font color="#D6D2DD">Ha, this is the best!</font><br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You think Marae Lassel is so great 
		huh? Here's one important question you have to ask yourself: Does it 
		have Ulgrim on it? That should tell you all you need to know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Alright, I'll tell you a story. Gather 
		round and listen to a tale so horrific it will keep you from sleeping 
		for three, maybe four nights.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Once there was a man who liked to 
		drink stout. It was stout for breakfast, stout for lunch and stout for 
		dessert. He actually ate a nice well balanced dinner, you know to keep 
		healthy.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, this man knew the way of things 
		and he was always exploring and asking questions to further his 
		knowledge. One of his trips took him to a deserted town nestled in the 
		woods. In fact it was a town much like this one somewhere in these woods 
		I believe.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;He was very tired from having traveled 
		all day and he decided to spend the night in the deserted Pub, whose 
		faded sign he could just make out in the failing light.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;He entered the old building floor 
		boards creaking and groaning like the voices of spirits he had 
		disturbed. Searching the bar he found an old dusty bottle on a shelf.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;&quot;Why not?&quot; the man said to himself 
		sitting at the bar and filling his trusty mug with the rich amber liquid 
		that poured from the bottle. It was at precisely this moment he heard a 
		creak behind him. He spun around, but there was no one there. He sat 
		back down and sipped the drink. It was the most delicious stout he had 
		ever tasted. An ambrosia of the gods, a drink that made the soul soar 
		and the mind spin, and so on.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The floorboards behind him emitted a 
		long groan. This time he didn't turn around. He didn't want to see what 
		might be there. Instead he took another sip. The floorboards ached. 
		Another sip and another loud wrenching of his nerves.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;He couldn't stand it anymore. He 
		tipped the rest of his drink back and jumped from his chair ready for 
		anything.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;But the Pub was silent now. He 
		searched everywhere for what might have caused the noise, but couldn't 
		find anyone or anything. As he turned back to the bar he saw something 
		that turned his hair white. There on the bar was the bottle he had left, 
		but it was empty!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;He rushed over and tried to get a 
		trickle from the bottle, but it was empty. In fact it was bone dry as if 
		it hadn't held a drop in years.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The poor man flew from that place in 
		the woods and never returned. Some things are just too frightening, even 
		for a brave man like that.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;They say that Pub still sits somewhere 
		in the woods waiting for thirsty travelers to stumble in. I imagine that 
		bottle still sits on the bar. I can even imagine that it might hold some 
		of that amazing stout the man drank, but at what price my friends... 
		what price?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.</font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Those blue fellows worry me. I think 
		their brains got frost bite up there. They need to relax, drink some 
		stout and learn to enjoy life for a change.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout. </font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It was nice to take a vacation in the 
		mountains. Did you know that you can get drunker more easily in higher 
		elevations? Oh, but that theory about crisp mountain water making better 
		flavored stout, not true. The stout may taste better, but it doesn't 
		have anything to do with the water.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout. </font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Silyun? Really?&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who's the 'Silly One' that came up 
		with that town name?&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout. </font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I read all of those old records about 
		Grael and his stomping on the Empyreans. Sounds like they had it coming 
		if you ask me. What I'd really like to know is where Grael's people came 
		from. Is it possible they were here before the Empyreans?&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout. </font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot; </font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give Ulgrim the 
		Unpleasant Stout. </font><br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I stopped by my island on the way here 
		and found something very strange. There appears to be some sort of hatch 
		in the ground in the middle of the island. No idea where it goes to, but 
		it's sure got me intrigued.&quot;<br>
