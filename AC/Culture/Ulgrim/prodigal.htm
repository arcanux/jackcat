      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;This is 
		my favorite time of year out here in Ayan Baqur. There's a pleasant 
		breeze in from the sea, and for a couple of weeks the flowers are so 
		fragrant you almost can't smell the rotten stink of Berkholt's cooking.&quot;
		<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Everyone is talking about the new 
		Drudge fort near Cragstone. You'd think they'd never seen a Drudge fort 
		before! Those poor people of Dryreach remain surrounded by Banderling 
		hordes and we decide that all out war against the Drudges tinkering in 
		Cragstone is the best plan of action. Who's running this place? I demand 
		to be heard!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Can you smell it? In the air? There's 
		a static smell on the wind... It smells of trouble... And apples. Oh, 
		yes, you know what I mean.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Do the Mosswarts wake up in the 
		morning and spin a wheel to determine who they're going to worship that 
		day?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The Anti-Drudge legislation that is 
		being passed in Cragstone cannot be allowed to continue. Yes, Drudges 
		are annoying and mischievous and, yes, Drudges will grab anything not 
		nailed down. But I ask you, are the Drudges our enemies?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm sorry, what was your question 
		again? Bring me a stout and I might remember. That was a hint, kid.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can tell you exactly what's going on 
		in portalspace. I was just there. What do you mean, you've seen me 
		standing here since morning? I tell you, I was taking a slow road 
		through portalspace, just to see the sights...&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;We should use a peaceful, guiding hand 
		in our dealings with these creatures. We can help them become 
		contributing members of Derethian society, no less deserving than we 
		humans or the Lugians or Tumeroks. It's in our future, I tell you.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh no, don't ask me what the Virindi 
		are up to! Haven't you heard about all those strange doings in 
		portalspace? No? You must not drink in the right taverns, then. Everyone 
		who's anyone in portalspace has been talking about it lately.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know these problems on the 
		Vesayens with the Mosswarts? You don't see the Merwarts having these 
		sorts of problems, do you? And why is that?&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm sure you can guess.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Okay, I'll tell you what the Virindi 
		are up to in portalspace. They're replacing the portalspace we all know 
		and love with Virindi crystals. Now let's see if anyone notices the 
		difference...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I received my doctorate by messenger 
		yesterday. I wrote a thesis for it titled &quot;Controlled Fermentation in a 
		Third Stage Distillation Matrix under Endothermic Excitation.&quot;&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You may call me Professor Ulgrim, or 
		my informal title, &quot;Yeast Master.&quot;&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;My birthday is coming up soon, did you 
		know? I once pledged to give up stout on the day after my 30th birthday. 
		Good thing I'm turning 29 this year.&quot; <br>
