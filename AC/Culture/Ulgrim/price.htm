		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Verily, this vitae I vainly vie to 
		remove after voyaging to the vault of the venomous and vile vermin of 
		virulent visage... Ah, forget it! I got hurt while trying to hunt the 
		White Rabbit.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Poko Moko! So slowly I turned, step by 
		step, inch by inch...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What did you say?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Har har har, more Runed Weapons 
		somehow made their way from Varicci's vaults to chests in the Valley of 
		Death. Oh, that's rich. Varicci's Royal Runed Melon must be red with 
		rage by now.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can't believe you didn't stop the 
		Essences from getting to the Harbinger. We're doomed! Doooooomed I tell 
		you!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I am bereft of stout! Un-bereft me or 
		I will fly into an un-drunken rage!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You! Ulgrim utters unspeakable 
		utterances upon you! Unburden your stout upon his unintoxicated un-thing 
		mouth hole... That's it, I can't think of any more u-words, just give me 
		some stout, okay?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I was going to write a song for my 
		lady about what a dangerous guy I am to love. I was going to call it 
		&quot;Ring of Stout.&quot; Want to hear the first lines?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim clears his voice and prepares to sing.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Love... is a boozy thing...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;And it makes... a foamy ring...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What do you think so far?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Sometimes people ask me what the best 
		thing about being me is. Now, I could mention my rugged good looks, my 
		mind like a steel trap, my encyclopedic knowledge of everything, or even 
		my chiseled abdominal muscles. But really, the best thing about being me 
		is that I'm so witty, I can keep myself entertained. That really takes 
		the edge off things.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear tell someone has been spreading 
		vile calumnies about my lineage! They're saying I am the son of Aliester 
		the Loquacious! After all the time I spent avoiding him at family 
		reunions so he wouldn't talk my ear off... Why, it gets me so mad, I've 
		got to drink!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Me? No, I haven't appointed any 
		Castellans, Seneschals, or Speakers to my allegiance. Instead, my 
		officers are named Master of Stouts, Minister of Ales, and Lord of 
		Lagers.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I had an odd dream this afternoon. I 
		was staring at the sun, yes I know you're not supposed to, this was a 
		dream, now shut up! I was staring at the sun when I saw a spot begin to 
		grow on it. I reached up and tried to rub it off, but it just smeared 
		the dark all over and it began to spread.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Soon the whole sun was engulfed by it 
		and instead of casting light on everything, the sun was casting dark. I 
		heard voices in the dark and then I saw thousands upon thousands of 
		unblinking purple eyes creeping over the ground, coming at me. Under 
		that black sun, I began to scream and scream... I woke up screaming. Now 
		get me another stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's probably some trouble to be 
		found with the Raven Hand or the Shadows or something, way up there on 
		the northeast shore. I hope not. That's pretty close to where my little 
		Mosswart friends live. Any kind of Shadow disturbance up there could 
		sour their stout supplies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm glad my nephew has turned aside 
		from his selfishly destructive path, and has decided to start fighting 
		to help his fellow Isparians against the greater threats that confront 
		us all. He's even started training youngsters to follow in his 
		footsteps. Yep, I'm talking about Ketnan. Why, who did you think I was 
		talking about?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Isin Dule is back. It seems he ran out 
		of cheese while living with the Viamontians and now he wants our cheese. 
		Protect the cheese!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll never forget how you helped me 
		out with that whole broken wand problem. I really owe you one.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You deserve that... Fred. Fredrina? 
		Bah, whatever.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If we keep letting the Harbinger have 
		his way, he's going to burn-freeze-melt-shock us all to death! You 
		better get out there and knock him down a few pegs.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Let's not fool ourselves. We can all 
		see it coming. Count Dardante has been poking his pointy blue nose into 
		things beyond his feeble understanding. He's going to get us all in a 
		heap of trouble, just you watch. I never should have let that kid borrow 
		my old term papers when he was cheating his way through the Royal 
		Academy back on Ispar.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you know my face is on the Soul 
		Staff?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yup, I'm immortalized! It's the third 
		face down. Some people may claim it's the guy who created the staff, but 
		he's nobody and I'm famous.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There's probably some trouble to be 
		found with the Raven Hand or the Shadows or something, way up there on 
		the northeast shore. I hope not. That's pretty close to where my little 
		Mosswart friends live. Any kind of Shadow disturbance up there could 
		sour their stout supplies.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
