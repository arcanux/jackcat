      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ah yes, 
		winter is here. You know what that means? It's about time for my 
		vacation to the Vesayen Isles. No, okay, I'm not actually going there. I 
		haven't been there in years. Bad blood between me and that rogue 
		MacNiall. He tried to steal my lunch money back when he was a young boy 
		at school. And I was his teacher&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have 
		you seen my mug of stout anywhere? I think a Penguin stole it... Clever 
		little beasties, those Penguins. More clever than they are commonly 
		given credit for. And oh yes, they do have fine taste in beverages.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So there's now a Tanada House of Earth 
		out there somewhere, turning out ninjas who are obsessed with metaphors 
		about dirt. There's a House of Fire somewhere too, and the masters of 
		all three schools formed this musical group... Oh, never mind.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know I've been thinking about what 
		you can give me as a present for the Holidays. I think a nice stout 
		would be perfect. None of that mistletoe stuff, I'm allergic.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The snowmen are back. If you see an 
		angry snowman with yellow stripes tell him I'm sorry. I totally didn't 
		see him there!&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hate cold weather. After about a 
		month of standing out here in my winter-weight robe, well, let's just 
		say things start to get a little gamey. I think that's how the Mosswarts 
		took such a liking to me, in fact...&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, the earthquake at Lady Folthid's 
		estate? That was me. My bad, my bad. I hope I didn't break anything that 
		was important to that lady. But if I did, what is she going to do? Kill 
		me?&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh Asheron? No need to worry about 
		him. He's just... temporarily misplaced. As soon as you stop looking for 
		him, he'll just sort of turn up in some place you didn't think to look 
		in. Always works out that way.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Happy holidays! I would have gotten 
		you a present, but I got drunk and forgot to go shopping.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, don't tell me. Another training 
		house opened by the Tanada clan on Dereth? Ninjas are harder to stamp 
		out than cockroaches. A lot harder. Trust me, I've tried. Those little 
		tiny roach-sized houses with the poisoned food inside them just don't 
		work on ninjas.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, don't even try to pass me one of 
		those fruitcakes, friend. I patched up a hole in my chimney with the 
		last one I got, so I'm all set, thanks.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know Shan Zhen works for Ben Ten, 
		right? Ben Ten's an interesting case. I shouldn't tell you this, but 
		she's not actually Sho. She's a Virindi. Like that fiendish Claude. 
		Except with a much better disguise. Don't believe me? Grab her face and 
		pull hard, next time you see her. Then you'll see.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yes, I strongly recommend you head out 
		to Cragstone to speak with Shan Zhen. Maybe get to the bottom of 
		Asheron's disappearance. No, not Asheron's bottom. What would Shan Zhen 
		know about that? Don't be silly.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Why would I want a pet Penguin? Rude 
		little fellows. They swear like Viamontian pirates, but with less 
		grating accents.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Metos? He was a hack. Many of his 
		Golems are still functioning to this day. What kind of design is that? A 
		smart engineer would design the Golems to break down after a few years. 
		That way people have to go to you to fix or replace them. Perfect job 
		security. What's the use of making ones that just keep working forever? 
		See, and everyone keeps talking about how smart Empyreans are.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Stout! What a thoughtful present! Sad, 
		I didn't get you anything... How about an empty stout mug? Just been 
		emptied.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know what the worst part about a 
		blizzard is? The way all that blowing snow gets into your mug and waters 
		down your stout. That, and freezing to death.&quot; <br>
