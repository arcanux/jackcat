      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Late at 
		night, when the town is quiet, I think I can hear a voice whispering to 
		me. There's some kind of awful presence behind the ley line 
		disturbances. And it whispers to me in the night... It whispers 
		something... that sounds like 'Soon.' Soon what?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Mundagurg's in town! Strange, isn't 
		it? I sent him off to explore the whole island and he ends up here, in 
		my backyard!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'd challenge you to a game of poker, 
		but I seem to have misplaced my deck... I think I left it in the 
		graveyard somewhere. Have you seen it?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Someone should get that nut-job in the 
		Graveyard to drink a few stouts. I bet that would sort him out. I can't 
		think straight until my first morning stout.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Looks like things are afoot on Bur 
		again, eh? I knew that rescuing old Asheron wouldn't be the end of it! 
		Makes me tempted to go back there! Just for the nostalgia, you 
		understand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, you keep your talk of cards and 
		decks and that damn Jester well away from me. I'm sure there's nothing 
		at all about this Jester that concerns me. You hear me? I'm not involved 
		at all! Leave me alone!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I know I know, the scholars are all 
		running around like chickens with their heads cut off because the ley 
		lines have gone pear-shaped. Yep, you heard me right, the ley lines are 
		literally pear shaped.&quot;<br>
		[<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;April Fools! Did I get you?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Wait, a horde of ninjas was supposed 
		to come flying out of this pint glass as soon as I drained it. What 
		gives? Who gave me a defective Clan of Ninjas Joke Glass?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, right. I'm also a little bit late 
		on that April Fool's thing, aren't I? Seems like things have been all 
		discombobulated ever since that graveyard was ripped out of the ground. 
		Seems to me that whatever's happening there, it's big...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It seems someone let a crazy person 
		out of some prison in the Graveyard. Now he's running around making a 
		nuisance of himself. Maybe you should go have a talk with him.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tell him Ulgrim would like to explain 
		the medicinal properties of alcohol to him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yep, just for good measure, I went 
		back up onto those platforms and knocked Aerbax flat on his invisible 
		butt again.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I know all about that eruption of 
		Moarsmen from the tunnels under the beach. Yeah, not too far north of 
		here, along the shore! Why am I not doing anything about them? I've 
		already dispatched one of my little minions from the Merwart colony to 
		recruit likely heroes, haven't I? What more do you want from me? 
		Delegating is thirsty work.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;If we build a new town I say we call 
		it Ulgrim's Ridge. Now that's a town name with style!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've drunk things you people wouldn't 
		believe.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Burning Mana Blasts off the coast of 
		the Caul.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've watched pint glasses glitter in 
		the ephemeral light of portal space.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;All these memories will be lost, like 
		stout from a keg...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Time to drink.&quot;<br>
