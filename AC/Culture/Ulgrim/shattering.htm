		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can't believe that Grael is still 
		stomping around. What's Nuhmudira doing? Where's Elysa's arrow of doom? 
		Why isn't the Black Knight being all menacing? Do I have to do 
		everything myself? Fine. I'll invite Grael to a drink off. First to pass 
		out loses. Hehe, I've been preparing for this my whole life. I'm ready.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm not scared of Grael. Are you? I 
		didn't think so, you look like the brave sort...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Look out it's Grael!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Haha! I got you! You should have seen 
		the look on your face.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I imagine that King Varicci is feeling 
		pretty put out by the fact that his right hand man, the most powerful 
		wizard in his employ, went and got himself swallowed up by Grael's 
		darkness. Dardante doesn't drink, you know. That's how I knew you 
		couldn't trust him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Zounds! Did you hear about how much 
		money new arrivals are getting now? Must be nice, to be able to buy as 
		much stout as you want the instant you get here. Well, maybe it's not 
		enough money to get all the stout that I want, but I'm a pretty thirsty 
		guy.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You know, some days I really miss my 
		old pet from Ispar. I had a cat. I named him Wobbles. Boy, could that 
		cat drink.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Grael's little minions better not come 
		near Ayan Baqur. They may threaten my stout supplies!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I imagine that King Varicci is feeling 
		pretty put out by the fact that his right hand man, the most powerful 
		wizard in his employ, went and got himself swallowed up by Grael's 
		darkness. Dardante doesn't drink, you know. That's how I knew you 
		couldn't trust him.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You should probably stay away from the 
		swamps of Sawato. It is a mean and uncaring place in which someone of my 
		stature is not served a stout in his hour of need.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you like the Pack Doll? Just wait. 
		When you press the button on his back, he grabs the nearest person, rips 
		out that person's heart, and devours it. Oh, yours didn't come with the 
		button on the back? Oops!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now the theory about Grael having 
		three souls is pretty interesting. Completely false, of course, but 
		interesting. I think they came up with that because of a mathematics 
		error.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oswald came to talk to me the other 
		day. Nice guy, as it turns out. Who knew, all this time he's just had a 
		public relations problem. I mean, it wasn't his fault that his dagger 
		ended up in Elysa's back. These things just happen.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, I was passing through the swamps 
		outside Sawato the other day and I encountered a man who might even put 
		Varicci to shame.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Just imagine this, a barkeeper...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You are getting this right?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A barkeeper who tells me that he has 
		no stout when I can see it, quite clearly, right there behind him! What 
		is this land coming to when an honest man can not even get a stout in a 
		bar of all places?&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I can't believe that Grael didn't just 
		kill Dardante. Dardante is so uptight I bet he demanded a benefits 
		program before joining Grael.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'm glad Elysa and Varicci have 
		declared a truce. It was hard to keep up with who was secretly betraying 
		whom on behalf of whom.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It took a lot of magic to enchant up 
		those pack dolls and train my filthy assistants. You have no idea how 
		much stout I had to pour down their gullets before they agreed to work 
		for me.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;The end is nigh! Or is it nye? Really 
		it's not like the world will end if we're gone. Sure Grael won't make 
		Dereth a very pleasant place to live, but it'll still be here. And when 
		Asheron eventually shows up maybe he can kick Grael right in his nigh.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's too bad about Dardante. There may 
		have been time to save him, not too long ago. But once he drank the 
		Black Stout of the Heart-Render, he was lost to us forever. The moral of 
		this story is clear: life's too short to drink evil beer.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
		day.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he 
		said &quot;You, Gimpy! What kind of a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
		lgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
		everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I guess he didn't realize that I had 
		used a few attribute transfer gems... What a gimp.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I hear tell that Grael's over-eager 
		little fiends are raiding towns still. Won't he learn? He should be 
		hitting mansions. Attack the assets of the capitalist classes! The towns 
		are the haven of the innocent worker!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I was tired of having to run over 
		hills just to kill a creature so I created the Arcing Spells. Now 
		everyone is using them and nobody is giving me any credit! I think I 
		deserve the title Archmage at least.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ulgrim the Archmage, Master of Time 
		and Space, Leader of the Virindi Resistance, Master Tinkerer, Seer of 
		Truths, Lord of the Jewelry, Supreme Peppermint Cook, Celebrations 
		Advisor to the Queen, Chess Grandmaster, the Shadow Tested, Virindi 
		Regulator and Beer Lord. Yes, that fits nicely with my other titles.&quot;<br>
