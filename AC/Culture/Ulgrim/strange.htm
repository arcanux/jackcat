      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I had a 
		pet baby bunny once. He was so cute! He was my best friend! Then one day 
		I fed him some of my special secret beer. That was a bad idea. He went 
		crazy! He bit me and ran off into the bushes. Never saw him again.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Pookie, come back! I miss you, little 
		friend!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Tell I hear tell that useless meathead 
		Hrothgar has been asking questions about Mosswarts... Why's he so 
		interested all of a sudden? I don't want him to discover my 
		beer-laundering ring!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh no, I've said too much!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;People have been going missing? Funny, 
		I hadn't noticed. I'll go searching for them. First place I'll look is 
		the bottom of my mug.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I love little critters. They are so 
		cute when they are small and playful. It's just when they get bigger and 
		their claws and fangs get longer that I start to have a problem with 
		them.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't even want to alarm you, but 
		does it seem to you like Drudges have started acting a little more... 
		collectively? Next thing you know they'll be demanding weekends off from 
		toiling in the stout mines!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I think I know what's been behind all 
		the unrest among the Banderlings lately. They've run out of beer.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, don't bother with that pretentious 
		busybody Oswent. I knew him from our university days together. I know 
		what he's secretly asking people to find: his treasured golden gromnie. 
		That drunken sot forgot that he lost it to me in a game of darts. Boy, I 
		can't stand drunks.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I tell you, Mosswarts sure have a 
		knack for worshipping the oddest things. Big bouncing statues, or 
		thick-headed Banderling warlords... The ones who've found the one true 
		faith are those enlightened Merwarts on Vissidal Isle...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Doesn't it seem a little strange that 
		Drudges, Mosswarts, and Banderlings are getting all riled up all at 
		once? Trying to make a bigger presence for themselves here on Dereth? 
		I'm afraid I'm to blame.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I told them that no amount of town 
		raiding would impress me enough to invite them to my party, but they 
		went ahead with it anyway. Now I'm almost afraid to tell them no again. 
		Hey, maybe that was what they were going for... Fear instead of 
		respect... I'll have to remember that...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I have a theory about why the Drudges 
		are raiding Cragstone. I think they want to be more like us humans. They 
		think if they dress like us and use our tools that they can become more 
		civilized. I for one welcome our new Drudge brothers. Spread the word, 
		any Drudges wishing to explore the wondrous mysteries of stout may come 
		and study under Master Ulgrim. They should bring some of the pyreal they 
		took from Cragstone too.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Who kidnapped all those people? It was 
		me, in the conservatory, with the candlestick, that's who!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Can you smell that, in the air? It's 
		the stink of treachery. And it's coming from Claude's tent! Those two 
		are planning something terrible. I remember what they did to this town, 
		all those years ago! It smelled just like this then, too!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;No, wait. That's garlic I'm smelling 
		now. Never mind.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I bet you didn't know that some 
		magical components are quite deadly if ingested.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I sure didn't.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I'll never forget how you helped me 
		out with that whole broken wand problem. I really owe you one.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So... here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant gives you Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You deserve that... Fred. Fredrina? 
		Bah, whatever.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Applesauce, I tell you! Applesauce!&quot;<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, I've seen those Mhoire coins 
		before. Not so rare. Not so ancient, either. We used to play a drinking 
		game with them during my university days in Ispar. In fact, be careful 
		with those coins. You don't wanna know where they've been.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Yesterday, I almost drank a one that 
		was not cold. Good thing I caught myself in time!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've been working on some Olthoi Bait 
		in case they decide to come back. Through long and arduous testing I've 
		discovered that they can't resist stuffed mushrooms. Just walk through a 
		dungeon dropping those things in a line and you can ambush a whole swarm 
		while they're gobbling them up.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot;<br>
