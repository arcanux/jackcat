      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've 
		heard about these feeding pits the drudges have been keeping their pet 
		Monougas in.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's a great idea. Domesticated 
		Monougas are bound to be easier to milk than wild ones.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim's mug refills with a delicious looking stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant says, &quot;Fermento Intoxicus&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I thought that spell up in a dream I 
		had about a magic school for kids.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Bless those Merwarts! They keep coming 
		up with new and exciting drinks for me to taste.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Of course they aren't always winners, 
		like the barnacle and kelp mead they made up last week. But they just 
		try so darn hard, you have to admire that kind of dedication to 
		brewing.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I went for a walk yesterday and 
		stopped to rest on this rock. Turns out it was one of those new craft 
		golems.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Darn thing transforms right out from 
		under me and steps on my mug! I think those things look shifty if you 
		ask me. More than meets the eye, you watch out for 'em.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Ha! Temple of Black Water? I know what 
		that means! They're not brewing evil over there, kid, they're brewing 
		beer!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Evil lookin' Olthoi about these days. 
		I happened to see some of that strange breed North of Arwic.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's enough to drive a man to drink.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Mark my words the Virindi are behind 
		this. That or the Falatacot. Or perhaps the Dericost or maybe the 
		Shadows...&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Mark my words! Someone is behind 
		this!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It's time I revealed myself as the 
		true master of the Temple of Black Water. Yes, I'm the one that 
		corrupted the Tanada. Their Master back on Ispar once lost his fancy 
		jade medallion to me in a drinking contest when we were in school, and I 
		accidentally dropped the medallion into a pint of Ol' Stumpy's 
		Slobberknocker Stout. The Tanada were never quite the same after that 
		medallion got its dip into Ol' Stumpy...&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a U!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme an L!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a GR!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a I!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Gimme a M!&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What does that spell?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant is too busy to accept gifts right now.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Right! Grumli, my invisible pet 
		chicken. Have you seen him around?&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I keep calling out his name with the 
		letters all jumbled, just the way he likes it, but he hasn't come home.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Well, if you happen to trip over him 
		let me know.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Someone's been staying at my house. I 
		noticed my porridge was eaten and my bed was all mussed up. If I catch 
		him he'll be sorry.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;There aren't a lot of stimulating 
		people to talk to around here.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I don't mean you of course, you're 
		fascinating.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So, did you see the Archmage in 
		Candeth Keep? I hear her husband is out of the picture. She can buff me 
		anytime! Hubba! Hubba!&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Did you ever wonder where the eggs we 
		eat come from? And what about the supposed chicken our cooks make? I 
		don't eat either of them... just in case.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some monsters get stronger, some 
		monsters get weaker. Just remember what ol' Ulgrim says when the health 
		is down, fire is raining from the sky and monsters are clawing at his 
		throat.&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Strong...weak. I'm the one with the 
		wand.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;A bad decision&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Drinking alone in the rain&quot; <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Sorrow wet and cold&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout. <br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;You think Marae Lassel is so great 
		huh? Here's one important question you have to ask yourself: Does it 
		have Ulgrim on it? That should tell you all you need to know.&quot; <br>
		<br>
		You give Ulgrim the Unpleasant Stout.<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Some mage called me a gimp the other 
		day.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I asked him what a gimp was and he 
		said &quot;You, Gimpy! What kind of a gimp mage has a 40 Focus?&quot;&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;So I portaled him to that new valley 
		everyone is talking about to find out what kind of mage he is.&quot;<br>
		Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I guess he didn't realize that I had 
		used a few attribute transfer gems... What a gimp.&quot;<br>
