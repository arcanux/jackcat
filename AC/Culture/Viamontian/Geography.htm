	<a target="_blank" href="islands.htm">
	<img height="111" alt="" hspace="10" src="185.jpg" width="150" align="left" vspace="10" border="2"></a>The 
	nation-in-exile of Viamont occupies a chain of five islands, northwest of a 
	larger landmass that our sources name as &quot;Dereth.&quot;&nbsp; According to the King's 
	royal sages, these islands were named &quot;Halaetan&quot; in ages past.&nbsp; One of the 
	first things our King decreed when we established ourselves here was to 
	search the land for all clues of previous occupants.&nbsp; There were numerous 
	texts and artifacts of an apparently powerful race of conquerors and sages, 
	which lived here long before our arrival.&nbsp; Perhaps hoping to capitalize upon 
	this ancient heritage, much as our people borrowed the techniques of the 
	Rouleans on Ispar, the King decreed that these islands would once again be 
	named the Halaetan Islands.&nbsp; His Majesty had originally intended to name 
	these islands &quot;The Royal Domain of New Viamont&quot; – but he quickly realized 
	that such a name fails to account for the territory on the mainland that he 
	intends to conquer.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The island where Sanamar now stands has been 
	named after the King's own bloodline, the Corcosi.&nbsp; Corcosi Island is the 
	southernmost island, with only a fringe of ice on the northeast coast.&nbsp; The 
	hill of Sanamar was chosen as a most auspicious location not only because of 
	its southern location and its commanding view of the southern bay, but also 
	because of an omen.&nbsp; In the early times after our arrival, our people were 
	constantly at war, with the rebels of Bellenesse, the native creatures of 
	this land, or the harsh wintry climate.&nbsp; The King led us south and west from 
	our initial landing, until we found an omen on this southern coastal cliff: 
	a great bull of red coloring, silhouetted in the setting sun.&nbsp; The 
	manifestation of the emblem of the royal house was enough reason to choose 
	that site for our new home.&nbsp; Corcosi Island is the safest of our wild 
	islands, as royal power is most effectively exercised so near the capital.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To the north of Corcosi Island is perhaps the 
	most agreeable of the islands, named Lotila Island in honor of one of the 
	King's most loyal and powerful supporters, Countess Marena du Lotila, 
	murdered foully by the Duke's forces at the onset of the rebellion.&nbsp; A 
	series of beautiful cascading waterfalls on the northwest tip of the island 
	is the named the Cataracts of Sabella, after the King's gracious mother, 
	Queen Sabella.&nbsp; An outpost of knights has been established on the southwest 
	shore of the island, as a western lookout.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To the north of our primary settlement is an 
	island dominated by the Duke's rebels.&nbsp; There, on a plateau near the 
	northwestern shore, they have established their town of Silyun.&nbsp; The rebels, 
	craven as they are, have done a poor job of securing their lands, and the 
	entire island is stalked by more dangerous creatures than one would find on 
	the islands of Corcosi and Lotila.&nbsp; It is for their tainted presence that 
	the entire island is named Traitor's Island.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Immediately east of Traitor's Island is the 
	inhospitable island where our people first appeared after the King led us 
	through the portal.&nbsp; Because it served as the source of our advance upon the 
	world, we have named it Vanguard Isle.&nbsp; It is not so well-explored as other 
	islands, and there is a strange and dangerous valley leading to its 
	northernmost reaches, called Shadow Pass.&nbsp; To the north of that pass is a 
	settlement of peculiar creatures, civilized and quite adept with magic, 
	called the Fiun.&nbsp; Vanguard Isle is still a dangerous place to travel, and 
	all are cautioned to stay away until they have proven themselves with force 
	of arms or sorcerous might.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most dangerous of the islands in this 
	chain is the Isle of Ruin, east of Vanguard Isle.&nbsp; Ostensibly it is so named 
	because of the ruins of ancient civilizations found there – but these ruins 
	can be found on all the islands.&nbsp; No, it is more accurate to say the Isle of 
	Ruin earned its name from the ruin it brought to countless brave adventurers 
	who sought to explore and civilize its frigid expanses.&nbsp; A garrison of 
	knights has established a small outpost on its eastern shore, which we have 
	named Eastwatch.&nbsp; But even those doughty warriors hesitate to venture into 
	the terrible frozen valley at the northern head of the island, named the 
	Shattered Out-Lands.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Southeast of Vanguard Isle is the fortress of 
	the King's royal cousin, the legendary battle-commander, General Corcima.&nbsp; 
	General Corcima uses that bleak and foreboding location as his base from 
	which he will lead the King's forces to conquest of the Bloodless lands.&nbsp; 
	What more goes on there, I cannot say...</font></p>
