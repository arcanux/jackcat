    <td valign="top" width="440"><em><font size="2" face="arial">by Brandon &quot;meanbeard&quot; 
    Salinas</font></em><p><font size="2" face="arial">He was falling. It was dark and he was 
    falling. The wind roared past his ears. His stomach felt hollow and queasy. 
    Other than that, there was no sensation at all. He had no concept of time or 
    place. All he knew was that he had been falling for years, and as far as he 
    could tell, he was going to fall for many more. He thought that after years 
    of falling through blackness, he would have grown used to the sensation, 
    perhaps even welcomed it. But no. It was still as terrifying now as it was 
    when the fall began. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Because, after all, who knew when he would finally hit the 
    ground? </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Duke's eyes flashed open. All was still dark, but it 
    was not the pitch of his dream. No, there was light here, though that light 
    was barely discernable in the early morning hour. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He was covered in sweat. His blanket clung to his naked 
    flesh. He unwrapped himself from the heavy cloth and flung it to the ground. 
    He swung his legs over the edge of the bed and held his head in his shaking 
    hands. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The nightmares had grown worse. The war with Varicci had 
    progressed poorly, though the King had yet to locate Silyun. The Duke had 
    lost many good men, and there was no end in sight to the bloody conflict. 
    Many more Viamontians had found their ways through the portals, but most of 
    them were either rounded up by Varicci or slaughtered by the various 
    creatures that stalked this land. Few of them found their way to Silyun. 
    Even fewer were willing to align themselves with the Duke's small band of 
    rebels. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Silyun would not long survive. It was only a matter of 
    time before Varicci's forces penetrated the rebel defense. And once that was 
    done, no power on this world could protect them from Varicci's overwhelming 
    might. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Duke stood and walked to his table. He lit a candle 
    and opened the small wooden box. He unrolled the parchment within and 
    re-read the terms. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He had a duty to his people, didn't he? What good was an 
    ideology if all of his people were dead? </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Duke wrapped his fur-lined cloak tightly against his 
    chest. He made his way to Eleonora's cottage. Few stirred at this early 
    hour. Only a handful of guards patrolled the town's perimeter. The ocean 
    breeze whistled through the shops and trees. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He reached the town's edge. Eleonora's cottage was set off 
    from the others. Though she championed the ideals of The Individual - and in 
    fact was the one who had introduced them to the Duke - she never truly felt 
    a part of those she led. She held herself at a distance from the rest of 
    Silyun, choosing to live apart from them rather than with them, as the Duke 
    had chosen. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He reached her front door and raised a hand to knock. But 
    the door hung ajar, as though she had left in a hurry and had forgotten to 
    close it properly. That hollow feeling entered his stomach for the second 
    time today. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He nudged the door open and peered into the darkened 
    cottage. &quot;Eleonora,&quot; he called out. He stepped into the entranceway and 
    looked around. Her home was empty of all but the most basic furnishings. It 
    looked as though no one had lived here for years. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Duke walked down into the basement. There were 
    Eleonora's three possessions: a bed, a table, and a sword rack. The bed was 
    empty. So was the sword rack. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">A single piece of parchment lay on the table. The Duke 
    picked it up and read it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">His heart grew cold. He began to tremble. He dropped the 
    note and watched, helpless, as it fluttered to the floor.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Binwas led them through the frozen forest. His hands 
    were bound behind his back. He struggled to maintain his footing on the ice. 
    So far, he had fallen seven times, a fact which pleased Eleonora immensely.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Watch your step, Sir Binwas,&quot; Eleonora called to him, as 
    he slid on a particularly wet patch of ice. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He turned to her. &quot;Untie me, woman! This will go much 
    faster if I'm not falling on my ass every two minutes!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas strode out in front of Eleonora. He unsheathed 
    his sword. &quot;Mind your tongue, Loc. You speak to the Lady of Silyun.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Binwas stopped and looked Sir Bellas in the eye. Even 
    with his hands bound behind him, he stood straight and strong, filled with 
    the pride of a loyalist who had vowed to die for his King. &quot;No, Bellas. I 
    speak to the murderous daughter of the Traitor of Bellenesse. That bitch is 
    no lady.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas raised his sword over his head. He took one 
    step forward, ready to cleave the bound knight in two. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;No!&quot; Eleonora shouted. She placed a hand on Bellas' back. 
    &quot;He wants to die, Sir Bellas. We'll grant him that soon enough. But for now, 
    we need him.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Carlo, the only other member of their party, broke his 
    silence. &quot;Sir Bellas, please. The sooner we finish here the better.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas stared his foe in the eyes. Neither man blinked 
    nor looked away. Sir Bellas dearly wanted to plant his sword in the 
    arrogant, smug face of the man before him, but he knew Eleonora was right. 
    They were here on a mission. And there was no way they could accomplish it 
    without Loc. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He sheathed his sword. Eleonora stepped away from him, 
    content that her bodyguard was not about to carve up the only man capable of 
    leading them to Varicci. Then Bellas took a step forward and slammed his 
    fist into Loc's gut. Sir Binwas buckled and fell to his knees, coughing.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas stepped away from the wheezing, sputtering man 
    and spat on him. He turned to Eleonora. &quot;I'm ready to go when you are.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Binwas vomited, then rested his head on the ice.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;They are coming, my King.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Varicci followed his scout's gaze into the barren plain 
    below. He squinted against the white glare of the ice. He gave his eyes a 
    moment to adjust themselves to the dazzling light. For several seconds, he 
    saw nothing but the glare. But gradually, he made out the figures. Four 
    small dots on that ice-covered landscape. One of them stumbled ahead of the 
    others, slipping and falling. He looked like a drunkard. Or a bound man 
    marching to his death. That would be Loc.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He thought it strange that this sight afforded him no 
    sense of joy or achievement. The moment of his enemy's defeat was nigh. The 
    woman who had slain his brother was down there, ready for death. With her 
    gone, the Duke would either surrender or over-commit his forces in an 
    ill-advised act of vengeance. The war was at an end. All he had to do was 
    play this one last part.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">But still, he felt no joy. Merely a grim sense of purpose, 
    the same hollow drive he had felt these last few years. He knew that he had 
    a job to do. He knew the glory of Sanamar rested on his shoulders. But he 
    could muster no feeling for it.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas stopped. He held up a hand and the party froze. 
    Eleonora stepped up behind Loc's back and slipped a gauntleted hand over his 
    mouth. She held a poniard to the back of his neck.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Up ahead, just past a field of frozen trees, a thin 
    tendril of smoke snaked upwards to the heavens. Eleonora whispered in Loc's 
    ear. &quot;This it?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Loc slowly nodded his head.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora looked to Carlo and nodded. Carlo removed two 
    bundles of cloth from his pack. Eleonora shoved Loc down on his knees. 
    Before the man could make a sound, Carlo stuffed one of the small bundles 
    into his mouth. He then unraveled the other bundle and tied the long strip 
    of cloth around Loc's head, securing the gag in place.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora placed a foot on the man's back and shoved him 
    face first into the ice. She tied his hands behind his back with a small bit 
    of rope, and then tied his legs together at the knee. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;You'd better hope we make it out of there alive,&quot; she 
    whispered in his ear. &quot;Because no one's coming back for you.&quot; She smiled a 
    grim smile. &quot;Except maybe the Ruschk.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas strode forward. Eleonora and Carlo followed.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora crouched behind the ice-encrusted tree. Carlo 
    huddled behind her. Sir Bellas had crept up the steep slope of the cliff 
    that overlooked the loyalist camp. He was hidden behind a rock just above 
    the loyalists, waiting for Eleonora's signal. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She looked back at the camp. These three men supposedly 
    held a portal gem into Varicci's chambers. These were the men who would 
    provide her with the key to assassinating the wretch who had tried to kill 
    her father. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The three loyalists sat around the fire, engaged in 
    conversation. The patch of land on which they sat was free of ice. The air 
    was slightly warmer here than it was on the northern reaches of the island. 
    Two of the men were knights and posed little threat. Sir Bellas could take 
    them both without a thought. The third one, however, was a mage. Eleonora's 
    own abilities with war magic were quite formidable. She could probably hold 
    her own in that duel. But if she were unlucky - if she were to fall - Sir 
    Bellas would stand little chance of survival. Carlo was not even a factor in 
    the fight. His abilities with the blade were negligible, and he had not a 
    spark of magical ability. He was merely here to help with the cleanup.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It was a risk, but it was one they had to take. They would 
    not have such a chance as this again. Eleonora readied her wand and focused 
    her energies on the mage. She called into mind an image of fire and spoke 
    the words, &quot;Zojak Quaguz.&quot; The wand glowed red. A fireball swirled into life 
    before her and streaked forward. The mage spared not a glance before dodging 
    out of the way. The two knights immediately leapt to their feet and ran 
    toward the ice forest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora had but a moment to realize what happened. <i>
    They know.</i> Before she could signal to Sir Bellas, he slid out from 
    behind his rock and leapt from the cliff. He landed right behind the mage, 
    but the mage was ready for him. He whipped around and delivered a powerful 
    surge of lightning that blinded Eleonora and knocked Sir Bellas to his back. 
    Eleonora blinked away the spots in her vision, but the world was still 
    overbright. She dropped her wand and took up her sword. She ran towards the 
    mage, or where she believed the mage to be. She knew this must be a trap, 
    but she was not about to leave Sir Bellas to his doom. &quot;Carlo! Run! Get out 
    of here now!&quot; she shouted over her shoulder.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She did not look back at Carlo. She merely sped toward the 
    mage, hoping to get to him before he could level his wand at her. The 
    distance, however, was too great. The mage took aim and fired. A massive 
    cluster of ice sailed through the air. Eleonora dodged out of the way and 
    the icy ball flew past. The mage summoned his will once more, but Eleonora 
    was on him before he could cast again. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She was dimly aware of a sharp pain in her chest when she 
    decapitated the loyalist. His head fell to the ground. His body crumpled in 
    a bloody heap.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora looked down at Sir Bellas and smiled. He looked 
    up at her, his eyes growing wide in alarm. Eleonora cocked her head at him 
    in wonder when another pain hit her chest. This time it knocked her to the 
    ground. She stared down at herself in disbelief. A massive arrow protruded 
    from her chest. Next to that arrow was another bloody wound. She felt her 
    back and discovered a corresponding exit wound. Apparently, the first arrow 
    had sailed straight through.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Sir Bellas,&quot; she gasped. The knight tried to stand, but 
    an arrow pinned his hand to the ice. He howled in agony. He tried to remove 
    the arrow with his other hand, but another arrow hit him in the leg, then 
    his back, then his hip.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;No!&quot; Eleonora screamed. Two more arrows slammed into Sir 
    Bellas before the assault came to a conclusion. The knight lay on his side, 
    blood pooling about his body. His breath was shallow and his eyes were dim. 
    Life rapidly fled from his body. Eleonora looked up at the cliff. A force of 
    loyalists looked down at her. Two of them wielded bows. Next to them stood 
    approximately fifteen knights and ten mages. And at the center of them all, 
    King Varicci himself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora ripped the arrow from her chest. A great gout of 
    blood shot forth and stained the ground before her. She stumbled to her 
    knees and then lurched to her feet. Blood poured down her armor. She stood 
    on unsteady legs and gripped her sword with both hands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Come down here, you dog,&quot; she yelled to Varicci. &quot;Come 
    down here now and finish this fight!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Varicci merely stared down at her. His archers readied 
    their bows, then looked to him for the order. Eleonora wondered if he would 
    have the courage to face her, wounded as she was, or if he would take the 
    coward's way out and order her death from afar. Her one hope was that she 
    could goad him into a fight. She was certain to lose such a duel; there was 
    no hope of surviving this day. But perhaps she could take the King with her, 
    and end her life with the knowledge that the Varicci line had been 
    extinguished forever.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">But would he fight her? He was not as prideful as his 
    brother. Though ordering his archers to slay her from their perch would 
    certainly be the cowardly way to end this battle, it was also the most 
    sensible. Eleonora was wounded, yes, but she was still a master swordswoman. 
    She faked a small stumble, hoping he would see her as weaker than she was, 
    hoping he would come down here and grant her one last chance to finish her 
    mission.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Varicci stared at her a long time, weighing the choice 
    before him. That stone face of his was completely unreadable. What was the 
    bastard thinking? Did he relish this moment? Did he thirst for her blood as 
    she did for his? Or was he merely going through the motions, simply staring 
    down a foe destined to die at his hand no matter what tricks she might pull? 
    That last thought filled her with a sense of despair that overwhelmed even 
    her fear of death. To think that perhaps she meant no more to him than the 
    fly meant to the horse who slapped it away with its tail chilled her heart. 
    She had wasted so much effort on this man, and there he stood, staring at 
    her with all the passion of a rock.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Finally, he shook his head, and his archers lowered their 
    bows. He readied his mace and worked his way down the cliff. His soldiers 
    followed and formed a ring around Eleonora and Varicci. Sir Bellas watched 
    with dimmed eyes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Varicci spared not a word. He merely attacked. Eleonora 
    had seen him in battle many times, and had heard much of his prowess as a 
    warrior before that. She knew that he was ferocious and skilled, but she'd 
    had no idea just how a powerful a foe he truly was. Renlen had been tough. 
    Loc had been tougher. But none of her foes had ever come close to Varicci's 
    might.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She fought her best. She parried as well as she could, 
    vainly tried to hit him in the few opportunities he gave her. But he was 
    just too skilled. She was a child wildly swinging at an indulgent adult. She 
    had no hope of defeating this foe.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She glanced at Sir Bellas' crumpled form. A tear fell from 
    her eye, a tear for the life she was soon to lose, a tear for the people she 
    had to abandon. She hoped they could win this fight without her, though she 
    feared they too would soon meet their ends. She swung one great wild swing 
    at Varicci. He stepped back and easily evaded the attack. Then he cracked 
    her in the head with his mace. Her vision turned white and she felt her 
    skull crack. A fierce blow to her chest knocked her to the ground. The world 
    grew dark and her hearing grew dim. She was dully aware of the sound of 
    cheers before she lost consciousness completely.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Grand Mother of Silyun knelt by the stream and cupped 
    hands beneath the water. The two guards the Duke had sent with her stood a 
    polite distance away, their hands on their crossbows, waiting for attack. 
    She hated that these soldiers had to risk their lives to indulge her 
    religious beliefs, but she could not turn her back on the spirits that 
    guided her every thought and movement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She lifted the water to her face and poured it on her 
    upturned forehead. She cupped her hands and lowered them to the water once 
    again. She lifted the water to her face and repeated the ritual. The third 
    time she placed her hands in the stream, however, she noticed something that 
    chilled her heart. A thin trickle of blood flowed downstream and eddied 
    around her cupped hands. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Grand Mother,&quot; called one of her guards in a tense 
    whisper. She looked to the soldiers. They readied their crossbows and moved 
    in front of her. She rose to her feet and peered downstream. There in the 
    water, a dark shape floated towards them. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Halt!&quot; cried the guards. &quot;Halt or we will fire!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The dark shape continued its course, floating quickly 
    towards them. A rather lengthy trail of blood extended before it. After but 
    a moment, the shape's identity soon became apparent. The Grand Mother's 
    breath caught in her throat. She raised a hand to her chest and stumbled 
    backwards.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Hellfire,&quot; cursed one of the knights. The two men lowered 
    their crossbows. One of them stepped into the stream and waded towards the 
    shape. He laid his hands on it and dragged it back to shore.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Grand Mother stepped forward and examined the body. 
    The corpse of Eleonora du Bellenesse was battered and bruised. Her armor 
    hung loosely about her, evidence of some great trauma. The Grand Mother 
    knelt next to the body and pulled the wet strands of Eleonora's hair from 
    the girl's pallid face. Then she noticed the hole in her armor. &quot;Help me 
    with this,&quot; she commanded the guards.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The three of them removed Eleonora's breastplate. Beneath 
    it was a tattered linen shirt. Two small wounds - obviously caused by 
    Varicci's archers - were buried in her chest. Next to them was a great 
    bloody hole directly above the girl's heart.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Grand Mother closed her eyes. A wave of fear and grief 
    threatened to overwhelm her. This champion who had been so kind, so noble,
