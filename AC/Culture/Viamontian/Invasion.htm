	Paul&nbsp;&quot;meanbeard&quot; Salinas</font></em><p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;They 
	come.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Gana</font><font size="2"> ibn Rushasa 
	removed his helm. He placed his hand above his eyes, shielding them from the 
	blinding light of the sun. He surveyed the bay before him; nothing but the 
	stillness of the sea. And far, far beyond, the shores of the blue-skins. He 
	grimaced and looked at his tattooed companion. The ocean wind ruffled the 
	strange man's long white hair. &quot;You see them?&quot; Gana asked. </font></font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The man looked at Gana with solid white eyes. 
	&quot;They come.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Gana</font><font size="2"> turned to 
	the army behind him. They waited at the base of the hill on which he stood. 
	Five thousand Gharu'ndim warriors stood alongside three thousand Sho. A few 
	hundred Souia-Vey mercenaries were scattered amongst the ranks. A mighty 
	army. A fearsome army. An army worthy of the Malika's magnificence. Yet, if 
	the white-haired stranger's reports were correct, even this glorious army 
	would not last long in the coming war.</font></font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Gharu'ndim general turned back to the 
	bay. He could not see the ships. Could not hear nor smell them. Heard not 
	the cadence of their oars crashing through the sea. But he trusted the 
	stranger. The sincerity in his voice could not be denied.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They were coming.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He put on his helm and waited. </font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Derikk</font><font size="2"> Gaul 
	careened through the forest. He ran amongst the pines and cedars of Lellen 
	Wood, the low-hanging branches ripping and tearing at his face and clothing. 
	His heart burned in his chest. Bile seared his throat. </font></font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He leaped over a fallen log. The tip of his 
	boot caught a wayward branch. He tipped forward, arms flailing wildly. He 
	slammed his face into the needle-covered forest floor. Lightning cracked 
	through his head. Breath left his body. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He rolled over on his back and struggled to 
	breathe. His lungs were closed. He willed them open, but they refused to 
	cooperate. Bright light swam through his head. He closed his eyes and tried 
	to clear his mind, concentrated on breathing, concentrated on pushing the 
	panic aside. Slowly, painfully, his lungs opened. The forest air filled his 
	chest. The light subsided. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He brought a hand to his shattered nose. 
	Blood. Pain. It wasn't the first time he had broken his nose. But he was 
	beginning to fear it would be the last. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He stood and looked behind him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fire.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The soldiers marched forward, thousands of 
	boots pounding against the forest floor. The mages burned the trees with 
	whitefire, clearing the path before the approaching army. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A deer ran past him. Derikk turned and 
	followed. He sped after the beast, tried to catch up. But the stag quickly 
	outpaced him. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They were not the only ones running. The 
	entire forest fled the invading army and its magic fire. Deer, birds, 
	wolves. Everything that could run, did. Derikk barked a short, morbid laugh. 
	Though he had ranged the wilds for thirty years, he had never truly felt a 
	part of it. Not until now. Not until the day when it all came to an end. In 
	fear, all of Ispar's creatures were united. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Derikk's morbid chuckle cut off as an arrow 
	sailed over his head and struck the stag in the back of the neck. The stag 
	buckled and fell, tumbling end over end just in front of him. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Derikk leaped over the deer and stole a quick 
	glance behind him. They were close. So close. Their fire disintegrated the 
	forest into ash. Their soldiers marched relentlessly. Five archers stood 
	several paces to the side of the army. They nocked their arrows and aimed at 
	the sky. Derikk wondered for a moment just what they were aiming at. Then 
	they fired. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Derikk turned. He ran. But he did not run 
	far.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Emperor stared out his window at the 
	chaos below. His meager army did their best to defend the city, but the 
	invaders were many. They cut through his frightened men and advanced on the 
	palace. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">How had this happened? Why had they come? The 
	Emperors of Roulea had never had the best of relations with the blue-skinned 
	kings, but neither had their disagreements ever come to war. Why choose now 
	to strike? </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But even as he asked, he realized they were 
	foolish questions. The Emperor knew full well why the attack had come. It 
	was the portals. Their appearance in Aluvia had disrupted the entire 
	continent. No one knew what they were or why they had come. And they 
	certainly had no idea what became of those who succumbed to the portals' 
	song. Conspiracies abounded. But no one had answers. No answers that anyone 
	believed, anyway. The rulers of Ispar were afraid, and so were their 
	peoples. And that bastard Varicci thrived on fear.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So they had struck out from their lonesome 
	shores. And now they were here. In the Emperor's kingdom. In his city. In 
	his palace. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Emperor closed his eyes and listened to 
	the cacophony on the floors below. His soldiers and servants screamed as the 
	unstoppable warriors cut them down. Subjects who had served him for years - 
	who believed that their Emperor would die to protect them - shed their 
	life's blood in the kitchens and quarters of the Emperor's own palace. Their 
	screams grew louder as the invading army sliced its way upward.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He walked to his throne and took his seat. He 
	closed his eyes and breathed. He waited.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He sat on his throne for what seemed like 
	hours. Powerless. Listening to his kingdom die. But after a time, it ended. 
	Mercifully, it ended. The screams and moans from below quieted as the last 
	of his people died.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They were here now, on the uppermost floor of 
	the palace, in the hallway just outside the throne room. Metal boots scraped 
	on stone floors. They paused. He heard commands uttered in hushed tones. It 
	would come quickly now. Soon he would be freed from this hellish shame and 
	be allowed to join his slaughtered people. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oak ground on stone as the massive doors 
	pushed open. The Emperor opened his eyes, and the Duke of Bellenesse entered 
	the room.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Emperor stared in shock. &quot;Bellenesse,&quot; he 
	whispered.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke walked to the center of the grand 
	hall. Several Ferran knights entered behind him and took their positions on 
	opposite walls. Two of them remained outside, guarding the entranceway.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke removed his helm and bowed to the 
	throne of Roulea. His armor was bloody and battered. His white beard and 
	hair were caked with dirt and grime. His blue skin shone with sweat. 
	&quot;Emperor.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Emperor knew this day would bring defeat. 
	He knew his kingdom would fall. But he had not expected this. He had not 
	expected betrayal. He struggled to speak, but all he could manage was a 
	weak, cracked, &quot;Why?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke handed his helm to one of his 
	soldiers. The soldier handed him a cloth-wrapped bundle. The Duke unwrapped 
	the cloth, revealing a scabbard of Silveran oak. He removed the gleaming, 
	golden blade from its sheath and handed the scabbard back to the knight. The 
	Duke held the sword before him, closed his eyes, and kissed the blade. The 
	he opened his eyes and said, &quot;Because he asked me to.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke strode forward and shoved the blade 
	into the Emperor's chest, pinning him to his throne. The Emperor gasped, 
	blood sputtering from his mouth. He grabbed at the hilt of the sword, 
	wrapping his hands around the Duke's gauntlets. He struggled to pry those 
	steel-clad hands free of the blade, but they refused to yield. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke of Bellenesse leaned forward. He 
	whispered in the dying man's ear, &quot;Hail Viamont,&quot; and gave the blade a final 
	push into the Emperor's chest.</font></p>
