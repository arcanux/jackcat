    <em><font size="2" face="arial">from the journal of Carlo di Cenza</font></em></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next morning, I woke and began 
	preparations to dismantle the tent. Sir Bellas stopped me. He wore a heavy 
	woolen cloak that was closed at the front with a series of small bronze 
	clasps. The cloak had a slightly misshapen look to it. After a moment's 
	observation, I made out the shape of his armor beneath the thick wool. Sir 
	Bellas was ready for battle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;When it happens, stay close,&quot; he told me. He 
	reached into his cloak. I noticed a heavy crossbow tied close to his side. 
	He pulled out three long daggers and handed them to me. &quot;Keep these in 
	reach. Your belt, perhaps. I will do what I can to protect you, but I can 
	promise nothing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I took the knives and placed them securely 
	beneath my belt. They were hidden from view, but quite easily reachable if I 
	needed them. I am not well-trained in battle, and so I hoped I would not 
	need those knives, but I had seldom seen my knight so grave. I resigned 
	myself to the fight ahead - a fight against the Royal Guard of Viamont.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I did not pack the tent. Sir Bellas told me 
	that we would need to flee quickly. We could not afford to be hampered by 
	any more weight than was absolutely necessary. Instead, we filed into the 
	tournament grounds. We had risen early and few had made their way beneath 
	the tent, so we were able to take our seats on the front row of benches. We 
	remained as close to the tent's exit as possible. When it finally happened, 
	we would have to leave in a hurry.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sir Bellas and I sat in silence for two long 
	hours. He did not tell me what the day had in store for us. I did not ask.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The stands of the tourney pit slowly filled 
	with spectators. When the stands were full, Lord Marden entered, the prince 
	at his side. The crowd cheered the prince as the two of them sat in the 
	Lord's spectator box. Then the tournament began. We were treated to the same 
	sort of spectacles from the previous day - jousts, duels, and group battles. 
	When each match concluded, the defeated knight or knights exited the grounds 
	while the victor retired to the holding pen. Eventually, only two would 
	remain. And they would compete for the honor of the tourney helm.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora's identity remained a mystery to all 
	but Sir Bellas and myself. She never removed her helm, though the heat 
	within must have been stifling. She fought ferociously, and defeated all who 
	met her in the pit. With every victory, the crowd fell more to her side. By 
	the time her fifth match began, the crowd was on their feet, cheering with 
	more fervor than had yet been displayed at the tournament. They loved her, 
	though they had no idea who she was. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prince Renlen loved her as well. He wore the 
	same suit of armor he had worn yesterday. He looked more like a combatant 
	than a spectator. And probably, I thought, he meant to take part as a 
	combatant. The princes of Viamont routinely attend tournaments, a tradition 
	they began after Lord Darren's honor tourney four years ago. They do not 
	participate in the tournament itself. They choose, instead, to fight just 
	the one duel - the final duel against the tournament's otherwise rightful 
	victor. Of course, the princes have yet to lose even one of those duels. 
	Even if their opponent were not exhausted from a full day of jousting the 
	kingdom's fiercest knights, no loyal subject of the King would dare claim 
	victory over a prince of Viamont.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Doubtless, this was Eleonora's plan. She 
	hoped to win the tournament so that she could engage the prince in a duel. 
	But what then? Did she intend to shame him in defeat? Or did she intend a 
	far worse fate? Either way, he would demand her execution. Probably ours as 
	well. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the light of day finally succumbed to 
	the dark of night, the final battle of the tournament was announced. The 
	mystery knight would fight Count Corcima, King Varicci's own nephew. Corcima 
	had fought incredibly well that day. No opponent had lasted more then twenty 
	seconds against him. I had seldom witnessed a more brilliant display of 
	martial prowess. Eleonora would have a difficult time with him, I was 
	certain.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Count Corcima strode to the center of the 
	pit. He turned to Lord Marden's box. He raised his jousting sword to his 
	lips. I noted that it was not the same one he had used in the tournament 
	thus far. Those swords were common jousting swords made from common 
	Viamontian wood. No, this sword was different. It was made of fine Silveran 
	oak, and it was <i>massive</i>. The weapon must have weighed thirty stones. 
	Eleonora's piddly jousting sword would stand no chance against a weapon such 
	as that. If they were to actually cross blades, he would shatter her weapon 
	like a child's playhouse. But worse than that was a more chilling thought - 
	what would happen if he hit her in the head with that thing?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Lord Marden, Cousin Renlen,&quot; bellowed the 
	knight. &quot;I dedicate this victory to the glory of Viamont!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Marden and Prince Renlen stood and 
	clapped as the audience erupted into raucous applause. The simplest way to 
	rouse a crowd to a wild fervor has always been to invoke the glory of 
	Viamont, but these times of war engender an even greater sense of pride in 
	one's kingdom than usual. It is nearly enough to make one fear for one's 
	life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the applause died, Eleonora entered the 
	pit. Her appearance caused the spectators to leap to their feet once again. 
	She, however, did not bow to the crowd. She merely stepped into the center 
	of the field, raised her sword to her lips, and bowed to Lord Marden and the 
	prince. Then she took her battle position.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The crowd quickly settled down. There was 
	utter silence beneath the tourney tent. Eleonora stood, her left side facing 
	Count Corcima. She crouched low, her sword's point resting against the 
	ground. Her bronze heaume stared impassively at Count Corcima, who had taken 
	a more traditional tournament pose – body front, blade held to his forehead. 
	The two regarded one another for a moment, then Corcima attacked.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He rushed forward and swung low, that great 
	battering ram of a sword grazing the earth as its pendulous motion sent it 
	sailing up towards Eleonora's face. Eleonora leaned backwards, allowing the 
	blade to swing up past her face. There was a loud ting as the tip of the 
	sword grazed her heaume. She quickly stepped to the left and whipped her own 
	sword around, smashing the knight in the back of the head with the most 
	sickening thud I had ever heard.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Count Corcima tripped forward and landed flat 
	on his face. He did not move. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nor did the audience.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">No duel of that tournament had ended so 
	quickly or so fiercely. We were shocked at the speed of its resolution. But 
	more importantly, we were concerned for the safety of the knight. Such a 
	blow was more than capable of killing a man. And the pool of blood slowly 
	spreading around Count Corcima's head gave us reason to believe that it had 
	indeed killed <i>this</i> man.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But after a tense moment, the knight stirred. 
	He placed his palms on the ground and slowly rose to his knees. He shook his 
	head, spraying a light shower of blood into the sand around him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He staggered to his feet and turned to 
	Eleonora. The two regarded one another for a long moment. I feared he might 
	renew his attack against her, but as shaky as he was, I knew she could have 
	easily bested him a second time.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But such fears were unwarranted. The noble 
	knight bowed to the victor of the duel, then left the pit.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The audience members rose to their feet and 
	chanted Corcima's name. Lord Marden and Prince Renlen did the same. Eleonora 
	merely watched him go. The chanting quickly died as he exited the tent.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Marden called to Eleonora, &quot;Mystery 
	knight. You have bested every other contestant in these games. You have 
	proven yourself to be the finest warrior in the land. You well deserve this 
	helm of honor.&quot; Lord Marden gestured to a young page. The boy opened a small 
	wooden gate and entered the pit. He carried a large quilted pillow before 
	him. On that pillow rested a gleaming silver helm. A large horse's tail was 
	attached to its top and flowed majestically behind it. The page walked to 
	Eleonora, knelt, and raised the pillow before her.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora regarded the helm. Sir Bellas and I 
	tensed. He reached beneath his cloak and grasped his crossbow. I rested my 
	hand on one of my knives. If she removed her heaume now, how would the 
	prince react? The two had not laid eyes on one another since Darren's death. 
	Surely, he was quick enough to determine what Eleonora had planned for him.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But Eleonora did not remove her heaume. She 
	looked up from the tournament helm and spoke. &quot;Lord Marden.&quot; Her voice was 
	muffled from within the tight-fitting heaume, but it was unmistakably a 
	woman's voice. The audience gasped in astonishment at that. Lord Marden 
	looked at Prince Renlen, clearly uncomfortable with this development. Prince 
	Renlen merely gazed at Eleonora with a smirk on his hateful face.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Lord Marden,&quot; she continued as the gasps of 
	the audience faded. &quot;I have bested all but one. Until that duel is complete, 
	I shall not consider myself worthy of such an honor as this.&quot; With that, she 
	held the hilt of the sword to her breast, its tip pointed toward the earth. 
	Then she bowed her head.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Young knight –,&quot; Lord Marden started. But 
	Prince Renlen cut him short.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Leave the pit, page. There is one more duel 
	to fight,&quot; shouted Prince Renlen as he leaped over the railing of the Lord's 
	spectator box. The audience erupted into a series of shouts and cheers as 
	the page scurried to the sidelines. At the same time, a trio of retainers 
	swarmed on the prince. They removed his cloak, equipped his helm, then 
	handed him his wooden sword. His blade was not quite the size of Count 
	Corcima's monstrous weapon, but it was made of the same fine wood. Certainly 
	enough to shatter Eleonora's meager blade. I wondered if it was the same 
	weapon he had used to execute poor Darren. I am sure Eleonora wondered the 
	same.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora must have realized that she had no 
	chance of ending a duel with the prince as quickly as she had the fight with 
	Corcima. Her meager blade would not stand a chance against Renlen's sword. 
	She strode to a young boy who waited on the sidelines of the pit. He held a 
	large, cloth-wrapped bundle. She handed the boy her own small weapon and 
	took the bundle from his hands. She unwrapped it to reveal her own Silveran 
	blade. It was every bit the match of the prince's own, right down to the 
	platinum hilt.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora handed the boy the cloth and strode 
	out to the center of the field. She and the prince held their blades to 
	their lips and nodded a curt nod to one another. With that, the battle 
	began.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is impossible for me to describe the 
	ferocity with which those two fighters attacked one another. Nor am I a 
	skilled enough warrior to accurately recount the various blows and parries 
	each duelist levied against the other. All I can say is that the fight was 
	the fastest, fiercest match I ever witnessed. It was immediately obvious 
	that Eleonora had held back her full potential in the preceding duels. She 
	had always appeared to be just slightly better than each of her opponents, 
	but in this final battle with the prince, she displayed a level of finesse I 
	have never before witnessed; not even in my own Sir Bellas.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But no matter how skilled she was, there was 
	no way to escape the fact that this was Eleonora's seventh match of the day. 
	She was tired, and Prince Renlen used that fact to his advantage. Though the 
	two of them began the fight as equals, Eleonora quickly showed signs of 
	fatigue. Her attacks became less intense, her parries less sure. The prince 
	also grew tired, it was clear. No warrior can wield a sword the size of 
	those Silveran blades for long without succumbing to exhaustion. But 
	Eleonora's decline was much quicker than Renlen's.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I gripped Sir Bellas' arm. She was going to 
	fall. I was sure of it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Only moments after I came to that 
	realization, it happened. The prince delivered a fierce upward slash. 
	Eleonora parried the blow, but in the process lost her footing. She stumbled 
	backward. Prince Renlen took that opportunity deliver a quick kick to the 
	center of Eleonora's chest. She sailed backwards and landed in the dust with 
	an audible thud.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The prince was on her. He clearly had no 
	compunction against attacking a downed opponent. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The prince tried to swing his sword down into 
	her gut, but she rolled to the side. His sword sank deeply into the 
	hard-packed earth, and he lost valuable seconds struggling to wrench it 
	free. Eleonora sprung to her feet, and delivered a fierce kick into the 
	prince's right side. Prince Renlen staggered to his left, pulling his sword 
	from the ground. He nearly fell, but he used his blade to correct his 
	stagger.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He spun to face his attacker, clearly 
	expecting an attack against his back. But Eleonora merely stood, watching. 
	She wanted to win this battle; that much was clear. But she was a far more 
	chivalrous fighter than the prince.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two faced one another in a moment of 
	stillness. Both had nearly lost the match. They were well aware of their own 
	fatigue. Each understood this battle would be won in the next few moments. 
	And so did we all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora turned her left side to the prince 
	and held her blade lowered to the ground. The prince did the same.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">They regarded one another a very long time, 
	taking advantage of this brief respite to catch their breath. Their chests 
	heaved, and their breathing was audible, but other than that, there was 
	neither movement nor sound beneath that tourney tent. Finally, when the 
	waiting became almost too intense to bear, the prince spoke. His voice was 
	ragged and low.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Why do you wait, milady?&quot; he gasped. &quot;Come 
	over here and finish this fight.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora said nothing.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A look of agitation crossed the prince's 
	face. He was clearly not used to this sort of situation, and he obviously 
	felt the crowd's favor leaving him. He called out to Eleonora, quite a bit 
	louder this time. &quot;Why do you hide, lady? What girl hides beneath that 
	Bloodless heaume?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Again, Eleonora said nothing. She stirred not 
	a muscle.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Fight, damn it!&quot; shouted the prince. &quot;Come 
	over here and fight!&quot; His body was quivering with rage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then finally, Eleonora spoke a soft 
	proclamation that I almost missed. I almost wish I had, because those words 
	tore at my heart. &quot;I dedicate this victory to the young Lord Darren. May his 
	beauty live on forever.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Marden's eyes widened. He clutched at 
	his throne and gasped. Prince Renlen turned to the Lord for but a moment, 
	and that moment was all Eleonora needed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">She raced forward and swung her blade upward 
	at the prince. He turned to her and tried to parry her blow, but her 
	strength was too great. She knocked the blade from his hand and sent it 
	spiraling into the crowd, nearly splitting Sir Borlac's aged skull.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora cracked the prince in the face with 
	the hilt of her sword. His nose shattered, spraying blood onto Eleonora's 
	bronze heaume. He staggered and doubled over, holding his bleeding face. 
	Then she smashed the blade into his gut. It clanged against his armor, but 
	still knocked the breath from his lungs. The prince fell to his knees, blood 
	pouring onto the ground from his shattered nose, but Eleonora was not yet 
	finished with him. She swung her sword upward and hit him in the face again. 
	The force of the blow lifted the prince from his knees and sent him sailing 
	onto his back.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The prince's Royal Guards had their hands on 
	the hilts of their swords, but none made a move into the pit. The confusion 
	in their eyes was clear. They were blood-bound to protect the prince, but 
	until he called them into the pit, they were forbidden to intervene. For the 
	disgrace he would suffer at being &quot;saved&quot; by his guard when he had not 
	called for them would be too great. Certainly too great for one as proud as 
	this young prince. Great enough to have the offending knight executed, 
	whether that knight's efforts had truly saved his life or not.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But the prince did not call to his guard. I 
	don't know why. And to a degree I am glad he did not. For the prince was a 
	vile young boy who grew into a vile young man; he deserved his fate.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead, he lay on the ground with his hands 
	on his bleeding nose. He tried to stand, but his knees gave way. He sank to 
	the ground, kneeling before his attacker. He looked up and spat a mouthful 
	of blood and teeth at her. &quot;Bitch! What right do you have?&quot; he screamed, his 
	voice petulant and childish. &quot;What was he to you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora lowered her blade and removed her 
	heaume. Her dark hair clung to her sweat-drenched face, but her identity was 
	clear. And when the prince saw her, hope fled from his eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lord Marden stood. His mouth hung open. He 
	seemed a man torn between his duty to his kingdom and his love for his 
	long-dead son. His mouth opened and closed, struggling for words. But none 
	came.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora lifted her massive wooden blade with 
	both hands, its hilt above her head, its tip pointed downward towards the 
	prince's breast. &quot;Hail Bellenesse,&quot; she cried, then plunged the sword 
	downward. It tore through the prince's armor. Its bloody tip ripped through 
	his back and pinned him to the tournament floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The boy screamed. I had never heard such a 
	pitiful, heart-rending scream. But I had not long to relish it.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The crowd erupted into cries of shock and 
	outrage. As one, the spectators rose to their feet and unsheathed their 
	weapons. The crowd surged forward, and we were taken with it. I was lifted 
	from my seat and carried forward, my feet dragging along the dirt floor.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora released her blade. Renlen remained 
	pinned to the ground, his now-dead hands wrapped around the hilt of the 
	wooden weapon. Eleonora produced a small gem from within the folds of her 
	armor, then closed her eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At this point, my feet finally reached the 
	ground and I was able to move under my own power. The crowd rushed towards 
	Eleonora, intent on slaying her where she stood. I looked to Sir Bellas, 
	hoping that he would tell me what to do.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">He motioned for me to close my eyes, and I 
	did so without question. Though my eyes were shut, I was not completely 
	shielded from the blinding flash of Eleonora's gem. A burst of brilliant 
	light forced its way beneath my eyelids. As one, the hundreds of spectators 
	in the tourney tent erupted in screams of agony.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I felt a hand on my shoulder. Sir Bellas 
	quickly whispered into my ear, &quot;Let's go!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I opened my eyes. The entire tent was on 
	their knees, hands clawing at their faces. Blood poured down their cheeks, 
	as though their eyes had erupted in their very skulls.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I looked to Eleonora. She was already gone 
	from the tent. Sir Bellas and I fled after.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Those few people who stood outside the tent 
	looked to us in puzzlement. They had heard the commotion, but still had no 
	idea what had actually happened in there. I unsheathed one of my blades, 
	expecting one of them to try and stop our flight.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eleonora ran ahead of us towards a group of 
	three horses tied up near a small tent. Three small packs sat on the ground 
	nearby. Eleonora picked up a sword that was stuck point-down in the ground 
	and severed the horse ties with one quick stroke. She then picked up one of 
	the packs and tossed it over her shoulder without looking back. Sir Bellas 
	grabbed it out of the air and tossed it back to me. I quickly slung it over 
	my shoulders. The others did the same with their own packs, and we mounted 
	our horses. Eleonora sped off into the nearby forest. Sir Bellas and I 
	followed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was nearly an hour before we heard them 
	behind us. There must have been hundreds of them, scouring the forests for 
	any trace of our retreat. But we left no sign. Though we careened through 
	the forest at an incredible pace, we did not do so heedlessly. I learned 
	later that Eleonora and Sir Bellas had scouted their retreat several months 
	before. That fact was obvious as we made our escape. Not a branch was broken 
	nor a bush stirred. We sailed through the forest as silently as our mounts 
	would allow. In a matter of hours, all signs of pursuit faded into the 
	evening gloom.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have been in hiding for days now. We did 
	not take the direct route to the Duke's fortress. We instead traveled South 
	for two days. Once we reached the shore, we headed West for a time. Our 
	current plan is to commandeer some sort of small fishing boat that will 
	allow us to travel up the coast to the port of Salizzen. From there, it will 
	only be another three days to the lands of Bellenesse.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have not spoken much since the tournament, 
	only enough to coordinate escape and survival plans. I still do not know why 
	they brought me with them. And I can only assume that the entire reason for 
	this expedition was to avenge Darren di Marden's death. But one thing I do 
	know: I am terrified. Because I know what is coming. Eleonora showed herself 
	when she killed the prince! Everyone there knows that the House of 
	Bellenesse is responsible for his death! It is only a matter of time before 
	the King wages war on our house.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">But again, I must wonder, was this really 
	about Darren di Marden? Was he the only reason for this horrible turn of 
	events? Or is there some larger plan at work? I almost hope that there is. 
	For unless the Duke has some plan in mind to repel the might of Viamont, I 
	see no hope in surviving the civil war that is sure to come.</font></p>
