    <td valign="top" width="440"><font size="2" face="arial">Queen Elysa followed Jenavere 
	down the dark, damp staircase. Torchlight flickered against the stone walls. 
	The heat and stench of the place crawled upwards and closed around Elysa 
	like a shroud. She had not visited these dungeons in months. She'd had no 
	cause to. Enemies of the realm seldom allowed themselves to be taken 
	captive. Those who did simply killed themselves and returned to their clans.</font><p>
	<font size="2" face="arial">The two women reached the bottom of the stone stairs. A short 
	hallway extended before them, its low ceilings awakening a claustrophobia in 
	Elysa that reminded her of the first few years of her life. All those years 
	of running from the King's assassins, creeping through tunnels and hiding in 
	basements. A panic rose in Elysa's chest and took hold of her heart. She 
	closed her eyes and breathed, willing the feeling away. She felt Jenavere's 
	eyes on her, and became even more panicked. A queen should not show weakness 
	in front of her subjects. Even subjects as loyal and friendly as Jenavere.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">After a few moments, Elysa squashed the claustrophobia, 
	stuffed it back down into the dark place where she kept her Isparian 
	memories, and opened her eyes. She wiped a film of sweat from her upper lip 
	and nodded to Jenavere. Jenavere did not question. She simply pointed 
	forward.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Six cells lined the hallway. The doors to five of them 
	hung slightly ajar. The endmost cell on the right was closed. &quot;It's like 
	nothing else I've seen,&quot; Jenavere said. &quot;At first, I thought it was another 
	variation of the Burun. Some creature they've kept hidden from view. But the 
	more I study it, the less likely that appears.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;No, 
	this... this is something new.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Elysa gritted her teeth. &quot;Show me,&quot; she commanded.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Jenavere walked to the cell, pulled a heavy iron key from 
	her pocket, and opened the cage.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">The first thing Elysa noticed was the stench. The corpse's 
	noxious metallic reek forced its way down her throat and dredged up a 
	searing wave of bile. Her eyes watered. She blinked away the tears, 
	swallowed back the nausea, and focused on the rotting mass of flesh before 
	her.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">The thing was as large as a cow, though it appeared more 
	bloated than muscular. Its flesh was a sickening shade of pink and was 
	covered in boils, warts, and lesions. It had two massive, trunk-like legs, 
	and some sort of sharp spine jutting from its forehead. But the most 
	disturbing part of its body was its mouth. The beast's massive jaws were 
	full of hundreds of teeth. The power of the thing's bite must be enormous. 
	That mouth seemed to take up half its body size. Elysa grimaced. &quot;This 
	creature was built for eating.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;And that it did,&quot; answered Jenavere. &quot;It slaughtered 
	several cows, as well as a few of your subjects. A swordsman by the name of 
	Brayden Von Grohl finally killed the thing near Cragstone. He caught up to 
	it just before it could slay one of our Criers.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Elysa squatted and pointed to a long slit along the belly 
	of the beast. &quot;What is this?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Brayden Von Grohl, your Highness. He cut it open. Found 
	some fish, some boots, an apple. And toast.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Quite an appetite.&quot; Elysa stood and turned to Jenavere. 
	&quot;Burn this thing. We don't know what it's capable of. I don't want it 
	springing back to life and rampaging through my castle.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Jenavere nodded, &quot;Of course, your Highness.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Elysa made her way down the hall, but stopped when she 
	reached the stairs. &quot;Jenavere,&quot; she said.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Yes?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;When you speak to Antius next, tell him...&quot; Elysa 
	struggled for the words. She did not know what she wanted to tell him, but 
	she felt she needed to say something. That feeling that had come over her 
	that night in her bedroom still clung to her heart. That fear that she would 
	not see him again. &quot;Tell him to be careful.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Of course.&quot; Jenavere nodded.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Thank you.&quot; Elysa walked up the stairs, quickening her 
	pace as she neared the exit from the dungeon. She made her way to her 
	quarters and shut the doors behind her.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Elysa leaned back against the heavy oak doors and closed 
	her eyes. A new creature was always a fell portent. And there was too much 
	of a coincidence between this monster's appearance and that of the 
	Viamontian in Rithwic. She could not help but assume there was some link 
	between the two.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Elysa opened her eyes and looked at the bow on the wall, 
	that weapon Antius had taken to calling the Queenslayer. It beckoned to her 
	with its promise of a simpler life. A life of smiting one's enemies, 
	defending one's family, and ignoring the responsibilities of the throne. How 
	she wished to take up that bow and flee this castle. She would take her 
	child and her lover and find her way to Asheron. Turn her back on the 
	citizens who cared not for her rule or the steps she had taken to protect 
	them. Live the life of a free woman.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">It was tempting, yes. But it was not the right thing to 
	do. Not yet.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Soon,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I'll take you up soon enough.&quot;</font></p>
