		<em><font size="2" face="Arial">by Elgenia Montani, Grand Mother of 
		Silyun</font></em><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Viamontian Knights 
		serve as the heart of the fearsome army that King Varicci II has 
		assembled on the Halaetan Islands.&nbsp; The twelve-foot-tall armor-clad 
		behemoths are an imposing sight on any battlefield, and even more so 
		when accompanied by the ravenous Eaters.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Viamontian Knights are a new 
		creation.&nbsp; There were no such altered soldiers in the service of King 
		Varicci I on Ispar.&nbsp; The elite troops of the Viamontian army on their 
		home world were the Ferran </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Knights.&nbsp; Soldiers who displayed 
		exceptional skill and courage were recruited out of the Viamontian army, 
		trained in all the arts of battle at the prestigious war academies of 
		Viamont, equipped with the finest steel, and placed in the Ferran Knight 
		legions.&nbsp; Ferran Knights accompanied the great warlords of Viamont on 
		their diverse campaigns across Ispar.&nbsp; They shattered the center of the 
		Roulean imperial phalanxes and crushed the loosely organized Aluvian 
		militias on the Plain of Ayrifal.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Prince Varicci came to Dereth and 
		proclaimed himself King Varicci II, however, he was unable to rely on a 
		steady supply of recruits from the larger army and had no war academies 
		to train his elite soldiers.&nbsp; Furthermore, the new challenges presented 
		by their hostile and inhospitable new home demanded shock troops of 
		greater fortitude and raw power than what was available from even the 
		most elite of &quot;normal&quot; humans.&nbsp; Varicci II lacked the time to develop a 
		proper system of army and academy to train his elite warriors.&nbsp; He 
		needed shock troops, and quickly.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was at this time that a mysterious 
		visitor approached the construction site of the new Royal Hall.&nbsp; This 
		visitor spent most of a night in conversation with the King.&nbsp; No one 
		knows what words passed between monarch and guest during those critical 
		hours, because the King will answer no questions about the incident or 
		even the name of the visitor.&nbsp; What is known is that the next morning, 
		Varicci II sent his most trusted commanders far and wide throughout the 
		five islands, with vague and mysterious orders to search all the ruins 
		they could locate, and bring back &quot;anything interesting.&quot;</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It only took a few weeks for the King's 
		cousin, General Corcima, to come back with something that greatly 
		excited the King.&nbsp; It was a book written in an unfamiliar script, which 
		the King gave over to his council of arcane scholars to decipher.&nbsp; It is 
		suspected that the mysterious visitor returned during this period, and 
		soon enough, the royal researchers had achieved a breakthrough: they 
		learned of a dangerous magical technique by which a human might be 
		twisted and transmuted into a twelve-foot-tall beast of prodigious 
		strength and toughness.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Without hesitation, Varicci ordered his 
		soldiers into the chamber where his mages made ready to enact their 
		rituals.&nbsp; One by one, his soldiers were transformed into towering 
		brutes, engines of terror and destruction.&nbsp; In the process of the 
		change, most soldiers lost their minds and their higher mental 
		functions.&nbsp; Certainly none of them were capable of the kind of focus and 
		concentration that was required to work magic.&nbsp; Fortunately for the 
		King, they retained the ability to accept and follow commands.</font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The monstrous army worked well for a 
		time, and with their might, coupled with that of the newly discovered 
		Eaters, Varicci was able to establish a new realm by driving out the 
		huge insects that plagued these lands prior to their arrival.&nbsp; As the 
		royal domain expanded, however, the Viamontians encountered other foes, 
		such as the Ruschk and the Fiun.&nbsp; These creatures posed a more 
		significant challenge because they employed magic in their battles with 
		the King's forces.&nbsp; After an encounter in which his army of giants took 
		heavy casualties from crafty, spellcasting Ruschk, Varicci realized his 
		army needed to add a dimension of magical skill.&nbsp; He finally realized 
		that on this new world, brute force would not be enough – that a mixture 
		of arcane and physical power would be the best way to ensure the success 
		of his new army.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With that in mind, he soon developed a 
		system for the recruitment and genesis of the Viamontian Warcasters.&nbsp; 
		The soldiers with the brightest and most promising minds were spared the 
		transformation process.&nbsp; Instead, they learned to augment their weapon 
		training with fearsome spell-casting abilities.&nbsp; These mage-soldiers 
		would accompany their mutated brethren into battle and support them with 
		magic.&nbsp; Ensuing battles against the Ruschk and Fiun validated Varicci's 
		new strategy.&nbsp; With his islands secure, Varicci was able to turn his 
		ambitions outward, across the water...</font></div>
