    <td valign="top" width="440"><em><font size="2" face="Arial">by Brandon Paul 
	&quot;meanbeard&quot; Salinas</font></em><p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the 
	journal of Carlo di Cenza</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most difficult thing to get used to in 
	this new world is the varied abundance of sentient life. On Ispar, there are 
	only humans. We shared the world with animals and plants, but we were the 
	only creatures blessed with true intelligence. This new world is far 
	different. In my time here, I have encountered scores of alien societies. 
	Lugians, Drudges, Banderlings, Ruschk, and even the walking corpses of the 
	undead roam these lands. Most of these races are hostile, choosing to engage 
	in bloody combat rather than civilized discourse when meeting a new race. 
	The Fiun, however, are quite a different breed.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the Fiun first approached our city, we 
	assumed they were hostile. We'd been attacked before. Once by the Drudges of 
	the forest and once by Ruschk raiders from the glaciers to the north. We'd 
	grown understandably wary of strangers. So when we first spied the Fiun 
	emerging from the surrounding forests, we called the alarm and rallied the 
	town's defenses.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were five of them, a number which meant 
	nothing to me then, but which I have since discovered has a special 
	significance to the Fiun. They stood in a line, bereft of armor and weapon, 
	and simply gazed at our city. Their stillness allowed us a long moment to 
	take in the sight of them, a chance we are rarely afforded in these harsh, 
	blood-soaked lands.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fiun are slender, frail creatures. They 
	look very similar to one another; so similar that it is quite difficult to 
	tell them apart. They wear robes of exceedingly intricate patterns and 
	vibrant colors. Their eyes are large and black and quite hypnotic. You have 
	to remember to look away from time to time when speaking to them, lest you 
	lose yourself in those eyes. Their pale, grayish skin has an eerie, mystical 
	quality. And what's even stranger on this world of violence and death is 
	that they carry no weapons. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even so, their sudden presence on our horizon 
	unnerved us. We've come across too many magic-casting creatures on these 
	islands to suddenly lower our guard when confronted with a weaponless foe. 
	We all stood in position, waiting for their attack. But the Fiun did not 
	move. Sir Bellas had no idea what to do. Normally, he would have ordered an 
	assault, but these five slender creatures simply stood before us in silence. 
	We had no idea what was going to happen or what these creatures wanted from 
	us. The frigid wind froze us in our armor while our two peoples simply 
	stared at one another across the open plain.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After what seemed like hours, the Fiun 
	finally stirred. They pressed their hands to their chests and bowed. They 
	waited five seconds, then rose. The Fiun in the center stepped away from the 
	line and approached us.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sir Bellas raised his shield and readied his 
	sword. He opened his mouth, presumably to order the creature to halt, but 
	the Duke placed his hand on my knight's shoulder and silenced him. The Duke 
	and Eleonora stepped out from our defensive line and approached the Fiun. I 
	had to stifle a nervous cry. Neither the Duke nor his daughter was armed or 
	armored. Our archers would have to carefully lob their arrows over the Duke 
	should the strange creatures choose to attack. But for some reason, the 
	leaders of House Bellenesse trusted these alien beings. The rest of us would 
	have to trust that our Duke knew what he was doing.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke stopped three paces from the Fiun 
	leader. The Fiun placed his hand on the Duke's chest. The knights around me 
	looked to Sir Bellas. They were clearly uncomfortable with this strange 
	creature laying hands on our Duke. I could feel our knights willing Sir 
	Bellas to order the attack. But Sir Bellas held his ground. He is a skilled 
	bodyguard, but more than that he is an obedient servant to the Duke.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fiun reached forward and gently took the 
	Duke's hand. He then raised that hand and placed it against the ornate robes 
	which covered his own, slender chest. They spoke quietly to one another for 
	several minutes. We could not hear their words; could not even hear their 
	voices for the distance between us and them. But we could see their faces. 
	And what we say was joy.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a long while, the Duke turned to us and 
	said, &quot;Friends of Silyun, do not be afraid.&quot; He turned to the Fiun with whom 
	he had just spent so much time talking. They shared a genuine smile. Then he 
	turned back to us and proclaimed, &quot;Welcome Rehgus. Welcome the Fiun. They 
	are our friends.&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next several days were the most exciting 
	of my life. We welcomed the five Fiun into our city, showering them with 
	food and gifts, peppering them with questions about their society and 
	origins. Soon after we accepted them thus, five more arrived. Then five more 
	after that. Soon, we were host to more than sixty Fiun. We had never been so 
	close to such alien life before without having to fight them. They found us 
	as fascinating as we found them. They spoke to all of us, not just to the 
	Duke and his daughter. And they demonstrated a startling command of the 
	Roulean language, though their phrasings were a bit stilted. We found them 
	to be most pleasant as well, full of warmth and emotion. Soon after their 
	arrival, we began to forge very real friendships.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fiun I grew closest to called himself 
	Luhjre. We struck up an immediate friendship and rarely spent any time 
	apart. He was fascinated with my tales of life on Ispar. No matter how often 
	I described the lands of Aluvia, Gharu'n, Roulea, Sho, Milantos, and 
	Silveran, he never grew tired or bored. We stayed awake well into the small 
	hours of the night on many occasions - Luhjre pressing me for more and more 
	details about Ispar, myself answering his questions as openly as possible. 
	He loved the idea of Ispar, and I loved sharing that idea with one who 
	appreciated its beauty as much as I did.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But when discussion turned to his own world, 
	our conversations took a much grimmer tone. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The arrival of the Fiun was much like our 
	own. They, too, fled a great evil. They, too, stood witness as their 
	civilization crumbled around them. But their evil - their destruction - was 
	self-inflicted. It was their own pride and quest for discovery that 
	shattered their society.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fiun Rehgus was considered by many to be 
	the greatest mage in the Fiun world. He was the one who crafted magical 
	cures for the plagues that ravaged their lands. He was the one who taught 
	others the means by which they extended their lives for centuries. And he 
	was the one that stopped the &quot;fire that fell from the sky.&quot; When Luhjre 
	spoke of this last subject - on which I have never been able to coax him to 
	elaborate - he spoke with the reverence I have seen in the eyes of the most 
	ardent Karlun disciple. Clearly, Rehgus was nigh unto a god in the eyes of 
	the Fiun.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But Rehgus' failing was his obsession with 
	the creation of life. Like us, the Fiun were the only intelligent creatures 
	on their world. But unlike us, they lived for incredibly long spans of time. 
	Hundreds of years, from what I can tell. They had much longer to contemplate 
	their place in the world. Much longer to ponder what great meaning their 
	lives might hold. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rehgus, along with a group of like-minded 
	Fiun, came to believe themselves gods. After centuries of pondering the 
	mysteries of their world, he and his council became convinced that their 
	duty was to create that spark of life which fueled their own existence. They 
	felt that some greater entity had given them the power to create new 
	sentient creatures with which they could share the beauties of reality.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So they crafted a plan to take a common 
	creature, something that appears to have been the equivalent of a feathered 
	Isparian dog, and transform it into a sentient being. To that end, Rehgus 
	led five groups of five mages in a spell that lasted five full days. My 
	friend Luhjre was one of these mages.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rehgus' council retreated to a secluded 
	valley amongst a chain of low-lying hills. In those days, their cities 
	covered the majority of the world. But there were still some barren areas 
	where they could practice their spells without interruption. And for a 
	five-day spell, such a space was most necessary.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mages stood in a circle five rows deep 
	and bound the creature with a set of powerful magic spells. The animal slept 
	peacefully for five days, seemingly unaware of the spell which worked its 
	way into its body. For five days, everything progressed as intended. The 
	magics that were expected to take hold, did. The components that were 
	expected to be consumed, were. So when the fifth day arrived, everyone 
	expected the spell to be a success. They fully expected the dog to rise, 
	examine its surroundings, and speak. But, unfortunately, that is not what 
	happened.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the creature woke it looked at the 
	surrounding mages. It tried to move, but the magical bonds held it in place. 
	The Fiun peered into the beast's eyes, hoping to see a hint of intelligence 
	in the creature's soul, but there was none to be found. It merely looked 
	back at them with the blank look of a dumb animal. The Fiun feared their 
	spell a failure, their efforts wasted. But as they began to despair, some 
	small change did occur.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The beast coughed. It was a subtle cough at 
	first - barely even noticeable - but that cough soon turned into a strangled 
	choke, as though something were caught in its throat. The creature coughed 
	and hacked in an effort to clear the obstruction, but made no progress. The 
	coughing got worse. The creature barked and wheezed with increasing violence 
	until its entire body shuddered and bucked, shedding feathers with the 
	ferocity of its convulsions. The Fiun rose to their feet and exchanged 
	worried looks of concern.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That was when the creature screamed. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The animal shrieked as though it were being 
	ripped apart from the inside. Something was changing within the beast. 
	Something that burned like fire. It was but a moment before that change 
	extended to the creature's outer body as well.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It began to grow. Its torso puffed and 
	expanded. Its flesh began to shred. Blood ran down its sides and legs. It 
	screamed and screamed and then suddenly, its flesh was ripped from its body. 
	The fleshless creature howled as its limbs snapped and twisted. Its jaw 
	cracked; its mouth grew larger. Hundreds of sharp teeth pushed through its 
	gums. Its forelimbs withered and fell from its body, leaving behind great 
	bloody cavities. A new skin began to form, but this one lacked the plumage 
	of its previous flesh. It was mottled and blistered, covered in pustules and 
	boils. The creature thrashed wildly beneath the bonds of the binding spell.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mages were terrified. They screamed in 
	horror at the destruction they had wrought. They lost their concentration.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bonds were dropped. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The creature fled immediately. It barreled 
	through the circle, knocking the mages aside, and ran into the darkened 
	hills. The Fiun were left to endure the creature's shrieks as it fled into 
	the night.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many in the council fell to their knees and 
	wept. They were not simply filled with the shame of failure - they were 
	grief-stricken at the agony they had caused another being. The Fiun may 
	possess something of a god-complex, but they are nothing if not 
	compassionate.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the council devolved into a confused, 
	wailing mess, Rehgus remained calm. He assumed the creature would die soon 
	enough, but he sent two mages after it to end its suffering as quickly as 
	possible.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Several minutes after their departure, the 
	council heard more screams. But these were not the screams of the animal. 
	They were the screams of the Fiun.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fear now mingled with the shame of their 
	defeat. They knew not what might have harmed their fellow mages - for at the 
	time the Fiun knew nothing of predators - but those screams filled them with 
	the primal dread that flares up within us all when faced with nature's 
	ravenous hunger. Rehgus went to investigate, and he took the entire council 
	with him. The group fanned out over the hills, searching in parties of two 
	and three.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was Luhjre's group who found the missing 
	mages. When he told me about the bodies - the condition in which he found 
	them - he dropped his head in anguish. He wept for several minutes, unable 
	to form words. I have never seen anyone so aggrieved. I've met many whose 
	loved ones were slaughtered in battle, many whose misguided actions ended 
	the lives of innocent people, and many who have been so personally ravaged 
	by war that they simply could not comprehend breathing another breath. But I 
	had never met anyone who held himself responsible for the death of his 
	civilization. Not until now.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bodies were ripped apart. There was 
	nothing left but a mangled mess of meat and bone. At first, Luhjre believed 
	he had found the remains of the beast, but when he saw the tattered robes of 
	the Fiun on the ground nearby, he became aware of the horrible truth. This 
	mass of gore was all that remained of his friends.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The creature, however, was nowhere to be 
	found.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two days later, the beast made itself known. 
	Somehow - and the Fiun are unclear as to how this happened - the creature 
	multiplied. When next they saw it, there were hundreds of them. They 
	descended on Luhjre's city in a swarm. Gone was the agonized wail of the 
	wounded beast. In its place was a mindless hunger that knew no bounds. These 
	creatures did not merely destroy - they <i>ate.</i> It did not matter what 
	stood in their way; they attacked structures of wood and stone with as much 
	esurience as they did the animals and Fiun who fled for their lives. In a 
	matter of hours, Luhjre's city was lost. Over ten thousand Fiun lost their 
	lives. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Along with a handful of others, Luhjre was 
	able to escape. But the beasts pursued them for countless miles. Eventually, 
	Luhjre lost the creatures, but by that time his band of over one hundred 
	escapees had been whittled down to a mere seventeen survivors. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While Luhjre and his comrades hid in a cave 
	high in the mountains, the creatures multiplied at a frighteningly rapid 
	rate and laid waste to every other city on the face of the world. The Fiun 
	tried their best to fight back, but they had never had need for magics of 
	war. They were healers and creators; they were not fighters. Within a month, 
	the monsters covered the globe. Every Fiun city was destroyed. Seven million 
	Fiun were dead. Those who were not killed either went into hiding or met a 
	far worse fate.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fiun have long believed that the seat of 
	their intelligence lies in a gland in the back of their neck. This is where 
	their 'soul' resides, if you care to use such a word. There is something 
	about this gland that the creatures are attracted to - something that sends 
	them into a frenzy. Should the gland be ripped from a Fiun's neck, the Fiun 
	usually dies. But those that do survive the attack are driven mad by the 
	loss of this gland - by the loss of their 'soul.' They become wild, mindless 
	beasts bent on destruction and violence. They are every bit as frenzied as 
	the creatures that ravaged them, though far less physically powerful.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the course of several months, Luhjre and 
	his comrades ventured out of their cave and searched for other survivors. It 
	was difficult going. The beasts could sense the Fiun over great distances. 
	They gave chase to Luhjre's band of survivors and slaughtered many of his 
	comrades. But over time, Luhjre's clan grew in size. He found other pockets 
	of survivors and led them in search of still more living Fiun. Eventually, 
	they came across another large band of Fiun, this one led by Rehgus himself.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rehgus led the great clan into a massive 
	network of underground passages. By this point, they were too large to 
	continue scouring the world as one unit. They made camp in these caves and 
	sent small groups on regular hunts for more Fiun. Few of those groups ever 
	returned.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They debated for weeks on how to free their 
	world from the tyranny of the beasts. Numerous suggestions were bandied 
	about, but none were equal to the threat which ravaged the Fiun world. Even 
	the great Rehgus was bereft of any useful solution. Eventually, the Fiun 
	realized that there was nothing they could do. The monsters multiplied at a 
	frightening rate. And even if the Fiun could find a way to destroy the 
	creatures, there was no hope of rebuilding Fiun society with so few of them 
	left alive.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They fell into a dark despair. They stopped 
	eating; they stopped talking. Many of them left the underground passages to 
	meet their doom on the surface. Few who left even bothered to bid farewell. 
	After a time, Rehgus himself called a meeting to discuss the future of the 
	Fiun. His proposal was grim. They would all enter the wilds and surrender 
	themselves to the beasts. Their time had come to an end. The world of the 
	Fiun was over, and they had brought that destruction on themselves. Death 
	was the only proper punishment for such a transgression as that which the 
	Fiun had wrought.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rehgus seemed surprised at how quickly the 
	other Fiun agreed with him. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">They hugged one another, wept for their 
	fallen world, and began their final trek to the mouth of the barren caverns.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">But as they began their journey, something 
	happened. Something they could never have expected. In the cave behind them, 
	a purple ring of energy silently swam into being.</font></p>
