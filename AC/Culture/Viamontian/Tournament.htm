    <td valign="top" width="440"><font size="2" face="arial">by Brandon &quot;meanbeard&quot; Salinas</font><p>
    <em><font size="2" face="arial">from the journal of Carlo di Cenza</font></em></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It occurs to me that I have not written much regarding the 
    Duke's daughter, Eleonora du Bellenesse. While she was born long before I 
    entered the Duke's service, and has been the source of much consternation 
    for the entirety of the Duke's household, her life did not intersect much 
    with my own until recently. As long as I have known her, she has been 
    nothing more than the rebellious, morose daughter of my Knight's lord. I 
    never thought more of her than I did any other spoiled girl of noble birth. 
    I certainly had no idea the thoughts she entertained within her tortured 
    mind. Nor did I ever suspect the plans she had for the future of the 
    kingdom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">This story really begins five years ago, when Eleonora was 
    only thirteen years of age. The King and the Duke were on much better terms 
    then. The Duke led the King's army to a great victory in Roulea a few years 
    prior. It was this victory that paved the road for future incursions into 
    that weakened empire, and eventually forced it to succumb to our King's 
    banner. No lord was more favored by our King than the Duke of Bellenesse.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">So, when King Varicci was informed of Eleonora's impending 
    birthday, he invited the Duke, his daughter, and all of the Duke's house to 
    a tournament at Lord Marden's estate. Lord Marden was a loyal retainer to 
    the King and had hosted many tournaments in the King's honor. The King could 
    have hosted the tournament himself, but Lord Marden's tourney grounds were 
    far more impressive than any other in the land, including the Royal grounds 
    themselves.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora was thrilled. She had never been to a tournament, 
    but she had listened to Sir Bellas' many grand stories over the years, and 
    consequently possessed an overly idealized view of the chivalry and majesty 
    of those events. To think that she had finally been given the opportunity to 
    attend such a tournament - one held in her own honor, no less - filled her 
    with an excitement I had not witnessed before in the young girl.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">She spent the entirety of the trip pestering our company 
    for details about the various knights and warhorses she was to see. She 
    wanted to know all of their names and histories so she could make an 
    informed choice about which knights to cheer and which to jeer. Even at that 
    age, she believed strongly in a lady's duty to be fair and just to her 
    subjects. A notion, I realize now, that was not widely shared amongst the 
    nobility of that time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Her constant questions greatly irritated many of the 
    Knights in our caravan, but Sir Bellas never grew tired of the young girl's 
    interrogations. He answered her every question, even quizzing her from time 
    to time on the stories and histories he had shared with her. I must say, I 
    ignored most of their talk. The personal politics of the lowly Knights of 
    the land have never interested me. But I was constantly aware of the girl's 
    presence, which seemed to fill Sir Bellas with so much joy and peace. To 
    this day, she is still the only one who can ease his war-torn soul. And for 
    that, if for no other of her many fine qualities, I do love her.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">When we arrived at Lord Marden's estate, the girl could 
    not contain her excitement. The tourney knights had first arrived three days 
    prior, and more arrived by the hour. There were hundreds of knights, 
    resplendent in their gleaming plate and chain, their horses bearing the 
    standards of their houses. They were tended to by hundreds more squires like 
    myself, polishing armor and oiling weapons, erecting tents and cooking 
    meals. The knights busied themselves with preparations for the tournament. 
    At first glance, the grounds surrounding the tourney tent looked very much 
    like a battlefield. Knights bearing the standards of Bull, Swan, Bear, 
    Badger and countless other beasts jousted and parried on any piece of land 
    they could find. Their wooden swords beat against shield and armor and 
    created a cacophony not unlike a hailstorm beneath a steel roof.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora bounced in her seat, pointing to the Knights 
    whose armor and standards she recognized from Sir Bellas' stories. Everyone 
    in our caravan, even those who had long grown annoyed with the girl's 
    constant prattle, beamed at her obvious joy. After all, this entire 
    tournament was for her. It was good to see that it had the effect on her we 
    had all hoped it would.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As we rode to the edge of the Knights' camp, one of them 
    recognized our caravan. He stopped his skirmish and shouted as loud as he 
    could, &quot;The Lady of the Tourney! Eleonora du Bellenesse! The Lady of the 
    Tourney! Eleonora du Bellenesse!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As he shouted, the other Knights stopped their own mock 
    battles, removed their helms, and took up the chant. In a matter of moments, 
    hundreds of voices were shouting the young girl's name, pumping their fists 
    in the air and waving their swords.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The girl was stunned. She sat in her seat, completely 
    drained of her earlier excitement. Her face was empty of color. Her eyes 
    were wide and glistened with tears. Her father placed a hand on her shoulder 
    and whispered something to her, a smile on his face. She looked up at him 
    and nodded. Then she slowly urged her horse forward, and raised her hand to 
    the crowd.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Knights erupted in a frenzy of raucous applause. The 
    roar of that crowd was overwhelming - hundreds of warriors cheering the 
    young lady of my house, shouting her name and hailing her beauty. Their 
    display of pride and loyalty brought tears to us all.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The girl wept. She smiled. She shook. She laughed. She was 
    a torrent of wildly shifting emotions. And none of us had ever been so happy 
    to witness another's joy as we were right then.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The following days were the most thrilling of Eleonora's 
    young life. She watched joust after joust, fight after fight. She witnessed 
    the aged Sir Borlac defeat the young champion of the King's own army. She 
    saw the savage weapons of the Gharu'ndim pitted against the superior steel 
    of Viamont. She gazed upon the fearsome black warhorses of Milantos, who 
    tower above all others. There was even a Silveran warrior, his long white 
    hair and tattooed body - nearly naked, I might add - the talk of the many 
    ladies in attendance. Eleonora had never seen such wonders. And she would 
    never forget them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">During the tournament, Eleonora made fast friends with 
    Lord Marden's own son, Darren. They spent many hours talking and laughing, 
    debating the skills of each knight over the others. It was clear that the 
    two of them were quite taken with one another, a turn of events which 
    greatly pleased our Duke. The young Lord Marden was handsome, noble, and 
    heir to one of the greatest houses in the land. He would have proved a fine 
    husband to our lady had their romance been allowed to flourish.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I have had much cause to wonder lately, were I given the 
    opportunity to step back through time, would I have stopped their romance 
    before it had the chance to begin? If I had known what tragedies lay hidden 
    in the future, would I have separated the young lady from the lovestruck 
    lord?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Perhaps our lives would be easier now. Perhaps this 
    damnable war would not be upon us. If we had just kept the lady away from 
    that boy...</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Bah! There is no sense in pondering such thoughts now. The 
    events of the past must remain in the past, despite the present they have 
    shaped. Our course is set. There is nothing left to do but fight.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The King and his two sons arrived on the fourth day of the 
    tournament. Their arrival was greatly anticipated by all, and not simply 
    because they were the ruling house of our kingdom. Prince Varicci II, the 
    elder of the two princes, was highly regarded as a swordsman. He had 
    participated in a great many battles and had emerged victorious in all of 
    them. He, above all others, was the reason many of the tourney spectators 
    had traveled such great distances. Much of the talk of the past few days had 
    centered around the show the prince was sure to provide once he arrived. All 
    of the knights - even my Sir Bellas - longed to meet the young man in 
    battle. All of them wished to pit themselves against such a highly regarded 
    warrior.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Unfortunately for us all, Prince Varicci II was unable to 
    fight in the tourney. The young man's arm was broken. He had apparently 
    fallen from his horse during an ill-fated hunting excursion six days prior. 
    He could barely move when he arrived at the tourney, numb as he was from the 
    pain-mitigating herbs and philtres his healers had doubtlessly administered. 
    We were lucky to have the man in attendance at all; there was no hope that 
    he would meet our knights on the tourney field.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The younger son, however, was in perfect health. And 
    unfortunately for us, he wished to take his brother's place in the 
    tournament.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Prince Renlen was an ill-tempered, hateful young man. At 
    fifteen years of age, he was rumored to have killed four men already. All of 
    them in duels that were supposed to have been conducted with blunted 
    sparring weapons. It was widely rumored that he forced his trainers to use 
    blunted weapons while he himself wielded sharp, poisoned blades. It was said 
    that he <i>liked</i> to kill. And he especially liked those deaths to be as 
    painful as possible.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">So when he caught sight of the lady Eleonora and made his 
    intentions towards her as clear as he could, we all fell into a deep dread.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Like Darren, Prince Renlen refused to leave Eleonora's 
    side. But unlike Darren, his presence was not at all welcomed by the lady. 
    She had heard the same stories about the prince we all had, and she detested 
    the young man. Her distaste for him was obvious, but still the prince 
    persisted in his pursuit. Darren played the good noble and stayed out of the 
    prince's way, but it was obvious to all of us the pain that Renlen's 
    attentions caused him. He became increasingly morose as the tournament 
    progressed, and eventually left the lady's side altogether.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Perhaps he believed that the lady was taken with Prince 
    Renlen. Many of us, in our youth, are prone to such mistaken, self-defeating 
    views of the world. Perhaps he believed that Eleonora would submit to the 
    prince's advances and become the new princess of Viamont. I suppose he came 
    to believe that the only way to win her heart was to best the fiendish 
    prince in combat and win the tournament.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I wish I had had the foresight to take the young boy aside 
    and counsel him in the ways of love. The lady's affection for the young lord 
    - and not for the prince - was obvious to all but Darren. If he had only 
    seen what we could see, perhaps he would have calmly endured the prince's 
    unwanted advances, resuming his place by the lady's side once the tournament 
    was over. If only that poor, doomed boy had not been so blind.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">But as I said before, the past cannot be changed. There is 
    no sense dwelling on such thoughts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">After hundreds of battles and only a few injuries, the 
    final day of the tournament arrived. When the final battle reached its 
    thrilling end, King Varicci announced that Prince Renlen would take part in 
    a duel with any man who wished to prove his mettle against a Prince of 
    Viamont. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The prince walked out to the center of the tourney pit and 
    bowed to the spectators. He wore a royal cape - the Bull of Viamont 
    emblazoned on its back - over a full suit of polished Alduressa armor. A 
    page rushed in from the spectator stands. He carried a large purple pillow, 
    atop which rested a massive wooden sword. Renlen took up the weapon and held 
    it aloft. The crowd gasped in admiration and wonder. This was no mere 
    sparring weapon. This was a sword crafted of Silveran oak, infused with the 
    magics of the north. Strands of diamond-lace weaved about the blade of the 
    weapon, granting it a strength equal to - and some say greater than - the 
    finest Viamontian steel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Again, the King offered his challenge, &quot;Will any man here 
    dare to meet my son in single combat?&quot; But of course, no one responded. No 
    right-thinking man would willingly walk into a duel with that depraved boy. 
    He had not one spark of the nobility that graced his elder brother. Besides, 
    no one could forget the rumors of the boy's poisoned swords.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The King, however, was unfazed. He had anticipated our 
    reluctance. He had brought one warrior from each of the conquered realms of 
    Roulea, Aluvia, and Gharu'n. They entered the grounds and declared their 
    loyalty to the King. And one by one, they fought the prince and met their 
    defeat at the end of his sword.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Prince Renlen did not kill his opponents. He could not 
    have poisoned his blade anyhow, for its edges were blunted. But he did best 
    those three men. It was clear to us all, however, that his combatants did 
    not fight with the vigor of which they were capable. They put on a fairly 
    entertaining show, but in the end they fell to the prince as they were no 
    doubt commanded to.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">When the prince was done with them, he raised his sword to 
    the applause of all assembled. He dedicated his victories to the lady 
    Eleonora, who made no attempt to hide her disgust for the young man.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The tournament was nearly at an end. The prince was on the 
    verge of leaving the grounds when a voice called out from Lord Marden's box, 
    &quot;Good show, Prince Renlen. You have bested the foreign warriors which we 
    have already conquered. But how will you fare against Viamontian steel?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">A deathly silence fell upon the tent. All eyes turned to 
    the Lord's box. Lord Marden was white with fear as he looked at his son. 
    Lord Darren was cloaked with a robe bearing the Swan of his house. He undid 
    the robe's tie and let it slip to the ground, revealing a magnificent suit 
    of gleaming Alduressa armor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Darren opened the box's door and stepped into the dueling 
    pit. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Nice armor,&quot; the young prince called. &quot;I'll try not to 
    bang it up too badly.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Darren turned and pulled his own Silveran sword from his 
    father's box. Lord Marden was frozen in shock. He could do nothing but gape. 
    &quot;I'd worry about my own skin, if I were you,&quot; Darren replied.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora tried to rise to her feet, but her father stopped 
    her. She looked on the verge of tears. It was obvious she wanted to stop 
    this horrible charade, but her father whispered something in her ear that 
    stopped her mouth. What did he say, I wonder? Most likely, he told her that 
    stopping the tournament would harm Lord Darren's reputation more than any 
    defeat in combat. Most likely, the Duke assumed that the worst possible 
    outcome was a bruised head and a wounded pride. Apparently, the Duke had not 
    heard the same rumors we had.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Darren strode to the center of the pit. He raised his 
    oaken sword, holding it in both hands. He bowed his forehead against the 
    flat edge of the blade. Renlen did the same. The two boys turned in 
    Eleonora's direction and bowed their heads again. Then Darren spoke, &quot;I 
    dedicate this victory to the lady Eleonora. May her beauty live on forever.&quot; 
    Renlen merely smirked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The two boys turned away from one another, took five 
    strides, then turned back. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">They attacked in a fury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The duels heretofore seen in the tournament had followed 
    the traditional rules of tournaments from ages past. They were more stylish 
    than forceful, more concerned with the show than the victory. But this fight 
    was different. Love was in these boys' hearts, and blood would be shed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Their swords smashed against one another, against each 
    other's armor. They kicked and punched and screamed and cursed. At one 
    point, Renlen knocked Darren's sword to the ground. But Darren just grabbed 
    the blade of Renlen's sword with a gauntleted hand and smashed his forehead 
    into the prince's face. The prince's nose shattered and blood exploded from 
    his ruined visage. Darren tossed the sword to the side and kicked Renlen in 
    the chest, knocking him to his back.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The prince scrambled to his feet and turned to meet his 
    attacker. The two boys grappled with one another and wrestled each other to 
    the ground. They punched and bit and ripped at each other's hair. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Renlen was younger than Darren, but he was stronger. He 
    pinned the boy to the ground and straddled him. He punched Darren in the 
    face several times, shattering Darren's nose and teeth. Darren maneuvered 
    his arms underneath Renlen's crotch and lifted with all his might, tossing 
    the prince to the ground.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Both boys scrambled for their swords. Renlen reached his 
    first.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He wheeled about and ran towards Darren as the young lord 
    crawled to his own fallen weapon. Renlen screamed and leapt at the prone 
    lord. He landed on Darren, his boot crashing into the small of Darren's 
    back. The prince raised his sword high with both hands. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora let out a strangled cry. &quot;No!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Renlen sank the point of his blade into Darren's back. The 
    Silveran wood cut through Darren's armor and severed his spine. Darren 
    screamed, his cry shattering our ears. He grabbed handfuls of earth and 
    tried to drag himself forward, but his fading strength was unable to do 
    aught but claw. Renlen leaned forward on the hilt of his sword and wrenched 
    it round, like a cook stirring his stew. Darren screeched and moaned. The 
    crowd merely watched, sickened to silence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Finally, after moments that felt like hours, Darren 
    breathed his last breath. His body went slack, and his face rested in the 
    dirt.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The crowd was silent. I looked around me at hundreds of 
    faces contorted in shock and horror. Many wept.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Lord Marden merely hung his head. His face was red - with 
    grief, anger, or shame; I do not know which. But he refused to look at his 
    son's body. He merely stared at the floor at his feet.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Renlen released the sword, which remained pinned into 
    Darren's back, and looked up at Eleonora. He smiled and bowed to the lady of 
    the tournament. &quot;I dedicate this victory to the lady Eleonora. May her 
    beauty live on forever.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Then he pulled his sword from Darren's back, lifted it on 
    high, and plunged it into the young lord's skull. The crowd gasped. Women 
    shrieked.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Renlen!&quot; the King shouted. His face was purple with rage. 
    The veins in his neck strained against his flesh. But Renlen did not even 
    acknowledge him. He merely stared down at his prey, a satisfied smile on his 
    face.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora's resolve cracked. She burst into a fit of 
    wailing. She clung to her father and sobbed into his chest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I was standing next to Sir Bellas when I saw something 
    that filled my heart with terror. Sir Bellas placed his hand on the hilt of 
    his sword. He exchanged glances with the Duke's other Knights. Soon, all of 
    them had their hands on their own sword hilts. The other squires and I 
    stepped away from our knights, knowing full well what was about to happen.
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas took a step forward, but a cacophony from 
    outside the tent stayed his assault. The entrance to the tent was ripped 
    open. The Royal Guard poured into the pit, forming a circle around the 
    prince. The King made his way to his Knights, followed by the elder prince. 
    The Royal Guard encircled the King and his sons and escorted them out of the 
    pit, barely averting a civil war.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">You can imagine the tone of the caravan home. No one 
    spoke. The young lady remained enclosed in her carriage the whole journey. 
    From time to time, she wailed and wept. But mostly she was silent. And those 
    silences were more terrifying and heartbreaking than her cries.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The next five years were quiet ones for Eleonora. She 
    spent most of her time reading or riding alone. She no longer teased the 
    servants' children. She no longer talked the cooks into playing games with 
    her when they should have been preparing the Duke's supper. She became the 
    girl that I think of when someone mentions her name to me now. Quiet, 
    lonely, and distant.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">To think of the thoughts that raged in her head. To think 
    of what she was reading. To think of that great secret Sir Bellas kept from 
    me. I can scarcely believe such world-shaking events were unfolding right 
    before me, and all without anyone in the house suspecting a thing.</font></p>
