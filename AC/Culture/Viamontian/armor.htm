    <td valign="top" width="440"><em><font size="2" face="Arial">By Ealdor 
	Tharim the Stronghand, Master Armorer of Aluvia</font></em><p>
	<font size="2" face="Arial">The military successes of the Viamontian armies 
	have been impressive.&nbsp; They have won victories in a range of different 
	settings and in different conditions.&nbsp; In their most recent invasion of 
	Aluvia, which began twenty years ago, their warlords matched wits with our 
	own western border lords in a chaotic campaign of raid and counter-raid.&nbsp; 
	Through superior scouting and tactics that I must admit were brilliant, they 
	isolated and crushed each of our lords' militias before they could join 
	forces.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">During their invasion of Roulea, they engaged 
	the Roulean imperial legion on an open field, two enormous armies clashing 
	on a scale not seen in hundreds of years.&nbsp; Not even the Gharu'ndim under 
	Rakhil the Conqueror had dared to engage the Rouleans 
	strength-for-strength.&nbsp; By meeting and defeating the entire host of the 
	dying empire on an open field, the Viamontians, it seems to me, served 
	notice to the other nations of the Ironsea.&nbsp; They seemed to signal to the 
	rest of the world that none could stand before them. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While there is much to be said in praise of 
	the strategic mastery of their battle commanders, or the fierceness and 
	training of their soldiers, one key asset to that victory was the quality of 
	that army's equipment.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Viamont is not a land blessed with many mines 
	of gold or iron.&nbsp; However, centuries of military plunder, piracy on the 
	seas, and dominance of trade have made them wealthy.&nbsp; Unlike the Rouleans, 
	who delighted in building great cities and palaces, the Viamontians do not 
	hesitate to channel most of their money into their army.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Viamontians are clever in the way they 
	plunder conquered lands.&nbsp; One might say that they have had centuries of 
	practice. &nbsp;Their strongest garrisons in the half of Aluvia that they still 
	hold are not maintained at cities or palaces, but at our mines.&nbsp; Much of the 
	metal wealth of our land flows steadily west, into the massive stores of 
	their king's own cousin, Count Etien di Forsa.&nbsp; The Royal Armor-Master owns 
	a great armory complex, large as an Aluvian market village, just outside of 
	the Viamontian royal city of Corcosa.&nbsp; Day and night, an army of laborers 
	fires a hundred forges to stamp out suits of plate armor.&nbsp; This Diforsa 
	Armor is not quite so heavy as the plate mail our own heavy cavalry wear, 
	but strong nonetheless.&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the great Viamontian host sailed from 
	Corcosa twenty years ago to finish off the Rouleans, every foot soldier in 
	that army was outfitted with a full suit of Diforsa plate.&nbsp; When the legions 
	clashed, the Roulean footmen in their suits of scale found themselves 
	overmatched by the Viamontian infantry.&nbsp; Judging by numbers, the Viamontians 
	did not have a numerical advantage over the Rouleans – not in foot, cavalry, 
	or archers.&nbsp; But each blue-skinned soldier was better outfitted for that 
	battle than his southern counterpart, and the results of the battle made 
	this plain.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">However richly the Viamontians outfit their 
	common soldiers, their lords and knights, of course, wear something better.&nbsp; 
	Most of the Viamontian warlords take a certain amount of pride in running 
	their own smithies and forging the armor for their own nobles.&nbsp; However, 
	there is one family that has managed to make their armor the armor of choice 
	among quite a few of the noble families.&nbsp; The Tenassa family, who are a part 
	of the Renari clan, have shown an unusual aptitude for armor-smithing.&nbsp; It 
	is said that the founder of the family, hundreds of years ago, studied with 
	some of the great smiths of Celdon and learned their secrets.&nbsp; Whether the 
	knowledge was earned or stolen, the Tenassas train a handful of children 
	from each generation in the art of armorcraft and maintain several large 
	smithies.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Tenassa ironworks are not nearly on the 
	scale of the huge complex of Etien di Forsa, but they are expanding.&nbsp; Count 
	Renari recently wheedled an exclusive agreement out of King Varicci, and now 
	his vassals, the Tenassas, supply all the armor of the Ferran Knights, the 
	elite soldiers who held the center of the Viamontian army in their clash 
	with Roulea.&nbsp; The Tenassas have also acquired armoring contracts from a 
	significant number of noble families who can no longer be bothered to smith 
	their own armor and are quite happy to pay for the exceptional suits 
	provided by the same house that supplies the Ferrans.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most extravagant armor of all, of course, 
	is reserved for the royal house.&nbsp; One corner of the Di Forsa complex, more 
	heavily guarded than any location in Viamont except for the royal hall, is 
	given over to Etien Di Forsa's father-in-law, Count Alain di Alduressa.&nbsp; 
	Count Alduressa is acknowledged even by the smiths of Celdon as one of the 
	finest armorsmiths in all of Ispar.&nbsp; No one is sure where he came by his 
	smithing skill, but it is known that, in his youth, he spent a decade 
	traveling the world, even visiting the distant holdings of the Sho.&nbsp; While 
	his armor is crafted in much the same style as other forms of Viamontian 
	plate, he is able to imbue the armor with a unique strength that surpasses 
	even the best work of the Tenassas.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Alduressa plate is coveted throughout Viamont 
	and it is reserved for royal privilege.&nbsp; It is worn by the Viamontian king, 
	his warrior children and cousins, and by his royal guards.&nbsp; Suits of the 
	armor are given out as gifts of great royal esteem.&nbsp; It may be significant 
	that the rebellious Duke of Bellenesse never received such a suit of armor 
	from King Varicci, even after the Duke's great triumph in Roulea, where he 
	slew the Emperor according to Varicci's wishes, with the king's own sword.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The kings of Viamont have always had cause to 
	be wary of their ambitious lords.&nbsp; It may have been prudence that kept 
	Varicci from giving a suit of royal armor to the bloodthirsty Duke.</font></p>
