    <td valign="top" width="440"><font size="2" face="arial">He who was once known as Filipo 
	Brasi followed his betters into the shimmering portal. The portals were only 
	active for short periods of time, just long enough to send a small force 
	across the water. The mages were only able to poke small holes in the 
	barrier; they were unable to shatter it completely. These holes sealed 
	themselves after but moments. When the holes disappeared, so did the 
	portals.</font><p><font size="2" face="arial">He stepped into the portal and was thrust 
	into portal space. He had not known this place for many years. Many... 
	years? Was that true? Could he trust this feeling? He was dimly aware of 
	some memory of this nauseating weightless place. Some memory of following 
	his king - prince - general to an uncertain future. He struggled to recall 
	the meat of the memory, but all that would come was some fleeting shadow.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">The ground solidified and he smelled the salt of the 
	ocean. It was like home, but the frost was gone from the air. There were 
	trees he had not seen before, sounds he had not heard before. And people... 
	there were people.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Bloodless.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">His betters charged forward, and he followed. The 
	bloodlust filled his being. The thirst for carnage and savagery. He let 
	forth a fierce cry of war, eager for the cleaving of flesh. One warrior 
	strode forward to meet him, and he who was once known as Filipo Brasi let 
	fly with his blade.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">His spada cut through the air, and crashed into his 
	attacker's head. The force of the blow should have been enough to decapitate 
	the man. It should have been enough to send the wretch to his grave. But his 
	attacker stood strong. All that remained of the passing of the blade was the 
	merest sliver of blood on the fiend's pale cheek.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">The soldier had but a moment to wonder at this turn of 
	events when his attacker raised a wand. The wand glowed and hummed, and a 
	shower of sparks engulfed he who was once known as Filipo Brasi.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Pain like that he had not known since his birth - turning 
	- ascension - destruction filled his being. His bones rattled and his flesh 
	blistered. He staggered to his knees. His eyes watered. He looked up at his 
	attacker, prepared to launch one final assault. The wand glowed yet again. 
	He tightened his grip on his blade and tried to stagger to his feet. But the 
	mage cut him down before he could move.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Darkness. Cold darkness. That embrace which he had long 
	feared. It wrapped its oily arms around him and pulled him slowly under. He 
	was dimly aware of some light, some warmth, further up ahead, but was 
	powerless to do aught but wish for it. He was frightened. He was shamed. He 
	was cold and terrified. But most of all, he was aware. He knew his name now. 
	He remembered what had happened to him. He remembered the bargain he had 
	struck with his King. Boundless power at the price of one's identity. The 
	strength with which to crush his foes and defend his kingdom.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">But his King was wrong. This strength was nothing compared 
	to the unnatural might of the Bloodless. He had forsaken his name for 
	nothing. And now his life was at an end because of it.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">He closed his eyes and waited for oblivion.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="arial">*****</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Light. Warm light. Death's cold embrace retreated and 
	Filipo Brasi was thrust into portal space once again. His mind reeled. Form 
	return to his being. Flesh wrapped itself around newly reformed bones. &quot;I'm 
	alive,&quot; he gasped. <i>And aware</i>. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Hysterical joy filled his mind, but was quickly pushed 
	aside by that familiar cloud. That cloud which pushed aside all thought of 
	past, all identity. He struggled to hold onto the consciousness he had 
	glimpsed only briefly, but it fled from him into the darkness of his mind.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">The ground returned. The salt of the ocean breeze, the 
	chill air of the north. He recognized his city. Sanamar. He recognized his 
	people. People who turned to him, mouth agape, shocked at his appearance. He 
	looked down at himself and saw that he wore nothing but smallclothes. He 
	inspected his body for the wounds of the mage's blistering attack, but saw 
	nothing.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">He was whole again. Somehow, he was whole again.</font></p>
