    <td valign="top" width="440"><em><font size="2" face="Arial">by Dave 
	&quot;Crowley&quot; Javier</font></em><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perro waited in 
	the darkest corner of the stable, pretending to brush his horse.&nbsp; In his 
	nervousness, every twitch and nicker from the beasts in the stalls caused 
	him to jump.&nbsp; Spying a movement against the far wall, near the entrance, he 
	turned, ready for almost anything.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Seeing nothing in the flickering light, he 
	let out a soft breath of relief.&nbsp; He was nervous enough about being in the 
	big city of Corcosa, so far from the castle where he lived and served.&nbsp; Even 
	more nerve-wracking to be here for a meeting with someone who was not a man 
	so much as a blood-drenched reputation.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A gloved hand clamped over his mouth.&nbsp; 
	Someone came up against his back, without even a rustle of cloth to give him 
	away.&nbsp; Long fingers, iron-hard through the soft leather, tightened around 
	his jaw and held his head still.&nbsp; He stood there, paralyzed, for a few 
	moments.&nbsp; Incongruously, his senses focused on the torches at the far end of 
	the stables, and the unperturbed breathing of his horse behind him.&nbsp; 
	Finally, cool breath at his ear brought barely audible words.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Be still, boy.&nbsp; You do not feel it, but 
	there is a dagger at your back.&nbsp; If you speak above a whisper, you will die 
	and your body will never be found.&nbsp; Nod if you understand me.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perro nodded as best as he was able, unable 
	to move his head very much against the crushing grip.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Very well.&nbsp; I am going to remove my hand.&nbsp; 
	You will not turn around.&nbsp; You will speak only when spoken to.&quot;&nbsp; The man 
	behind him stepped back half a step.&nbsp; The hand moved off his mouth to rest, 
	disconcertingly, on his shoulder.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Winter is coming, and the days are getting 
	shorter,&quot; came the voice in a conversational tone.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perro blinked several times, still shaking, 
	before remembering his own half of the catchphrase.&nbsp; &quot;It will be cold, but I 
	feel no fear,&quot; he whispered to the darkness.&nbsp; He almost giggled in nervous 
	hysteria, but managed to resist the impulse.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Good so far.&nbsp; Now... You were given a pouch 
	to carry.&nbsp; Slowly put your left hand over that pouch.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perro moved his left arm very slowly, until 
	his hand settled over the pouch the Duke had given him.&nbsp; It was close to the 
	dagger at his belt, but he never considered touching it.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hand left his shoulder and quickly yanked 
	the pouch off his belt.&nbsp; There was the soft rattle of gemstones knocking 
	against each other.&nbsp; There was a silence of a few heartbeats, then another 
	soft rattle, and the hand returned to his shoulder.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am going to put my hand back over your 
	mouth, boy, so that I can ask you more questions.&nbsp; Do not jump.&quot;&nbsp; True to 
	his word, the man put his hand back over Perro's mouth, but the grip was 
	softer and he kept half a step back. &nbsp;It was as though Perro had proven 
	himself trustworthy.&nbsp; He felt strangely honored.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am going to make some statements.&nbsp; You 
	will nod if the statement I speak is correct.&nbsp; You will shake your head if 
	the statement is incorrect.&nbsp; Nod if you understand.&quot;&nbsp; Perro nodded slowly.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You came alone, and told no one where you 
	were going.&quot;&nbsp; Perro nodded again.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You carry no signet or seal, no mark of your 
	master's house.&quot;&nbsp; Nod.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You met with no one but your master before 
	coming here.&quot;&nbsp; Nod.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You looked inside the payment pouch.&quot;&nbsp; Perro 
	was about to nod again out of reflex when he caught himself.&nbsp; He shook his 
	head vigorously.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am glad your master has servants who are 
	able to follow orders, then.&nbsp; And you display remarkable cool-headedness.&nbsp; 
	Good help, hard to find... You've heard it before, I am sure.&quot;&nbsp; Perro felt 
	and heard a soft exhalation, like a sigh of amusement. &nbsp;He finally started 
	to relax.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hand tightened its grip again, and Perro 
	felt a brief stinging pain at the base of his back, like a flea bite.&nbsp; He 
	started shivering uncontrollably and cold droplets of sweat beaded on his 
	head and neck.&nbsp; He dimly felt a thin trickle of heat flowing down the groove 
	of his back.&nbsp; As soon as he realized he'd been stabbed, his vision swam.&nbsp; A 
	face came into view on his left.&nbsp; All Perro could see were bright green 
	eyes.&nbsp; Beyond the face of his killer, the torches at the stable entrance 
	shivered and shimmered, and then all went black.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oswald drew his stiletto from the boy's back 
	and guided the body gently to the ground.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A good servant is hard to find.&nbsp; A pity your 
	master deemed you expendable.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He bent to close Perro's eyes.&nbsp; With 
	practiced efficiency, he wrapped the body in a horse blanket and rolled it 
	to the back of the stall.&nbsp; He spared a few more moments to dump a pile of 
	hay over the corpse.&nbsp; Surveying his work, he smiled and left silently.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">******</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Prince Varicci II stood on the battlements of 
	the royal palace of Viamont, inspecting the winch mechanism of the 
	portcullis, when a solitary rider appeared out of the dusk.&nbsp; He was whipping 
	the horse on mercilessly, as if pursued by abyssal hounds.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the rider drew closer, Varicci saw that he 
	wore the livery of a royal guard.&nbsp; All the royal guards were either here at 
	the castle, or with his brother at Lord Marden's tournament...</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sudden fear leaped to Varicci's mind and he 
	charged down the stairs to meet the rider.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Treachery!&quot; the rider called as he rode 
	through the gates.&nbsp; &quot;Treachery of Bellenesse!&nbsp; Prince Renlen is slain!&quot;&nbsp; The 
	rider pulled up short when he saw the prince, and Varicci saw that he was 
	caked in blood and dirt.&nbsp; He reached up and pulled the guard off the saddle.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Terrified of the prince's anger, the guard 
	stuttered, until Varicci slapped him, then put a none-too-gentle hand on the 
	man's neck.&nbsp; &quot;Calm down, man!&nbsp; What happened?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;T-T-Treachery at the tournament, Highness,&quot; 
	the guard gasped.&nbsp; &quot;Prince Renlen... Eleonora... The Duke's daughter. She 
	slew him!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What of Countess Lotila?&quot; Varicci demanded.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;She pursues the girl. I am the only one she 
	thought she could spare.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Varicci turned from the exhausted soldier and 
	entered the castle. He strode quickly through the castle corridors, pushing 
	aside or knocking over any who got in his way. The Prince made his way to 
	his father's private quarters.&nbsp; A servant was in the corridor with the two 
	door guards just outside of the royal chambers, arms laden with a tray full 
	of steaming food.&nbsp; One of the guards by the door was reaching out to open 
	the door for the servant when he noticed the Prince hurrying their way.&nbsp; The 
	guard paused, and his hesitation made the servant and the other guard look 
	his way.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Varicci snapped a finger peremptorily at the 
	servant.&nbsp; &quot;You there.&nbsp; Come here.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The servant bowed and turned towards the 
	Prince.&nbsp; &quot;As it please Your Highness.&quot;&nbsp; Varicci inspected the servant's face 
	as he walked towards the three men at the door.&nbsp; The man was old, the skin 
	around his eyes crinkling with wrinkles, and the hair of his beard was 
	grey.&nbsp; His eyes, however, were bright and alert as a young man's, and a most 
	peculiar shade of green...&nbsp; Above all, the face was unfamiliar, and the 
	Prince had always taken care to know the names and faces of all servants who 
	came in contact with any members of the royal family.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Old man, I do not know you,&quot; the Prince 
	remarked, clear challenge in his voice.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The old servant stopped and bowed 
	apologetically, managing to keep his food tray balanced as he did so.&nbsp; 
	&quot;Apologies, your highness, Steward Vittori has a cough something awful, 
	can't nearly get the breath to climb the stairs, and he sent me to bring the 
	King his evening meal.&quot;&nbsp; He kept his head carefully bowed in subservience, 
	but Varicci could see his eyes darting around alertly.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;How unfortunate for Vittori.&nbsp; Strange, he 
	didn't have such a problem this morning when he brought breakfast up to my 
	father's quarters.&nbsp; I do hope he doesn't... die of this sudden awful 
	cough.&quot;&nbsp; Varicci dropped his hand to the hilt of the longsword at his belt.&nbsp; 
	At this, the two door guards went on alert, brandishing their halberds.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The old servant chuckled nervously, and 
	seemed about to respond, when he spun suddenly into motion.&nbsp; Almost more 
	quickly than Varicci could track, he flung the tray of food, including its 
	bowl of soup, into the face of one guard, while snapping a brutal kick 
	between the legs of the other.&nbsp; One man sank groaning to the floor, and the 
	other fell over, screaming and clutching at his face.&nbsp; Continuing his 
	whirling motion, the &quot;servant&quot; flashed his hand across the throat of the 
	guard who'd taken the soup in the face.&nbsp; As the man completely collapsed to 
	the floor, a bright red line appeared just underneath his chin.&nbsp; A heartbeat 
	later it turned into a cascade of blood, pouring onto the rich red carpet.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the &quot;servant&quot; finished his movement, he 
	was standing in a defensive position, holding a long dagger with a hooked 
	blade.&nbsp; He no longer looked like an old man.&nbsp; He was clearly younger now, 
	with a stripe of blonde hair running down his chin.&nbsp; Nor was his skin the 
	normal Viamontian blue – now he had the pale skin of an Aluvian.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Varicci already had his sword out.&nbsp; &quot;I'd ask 
	you your name and who sent you, but I think I'll wait until you are racked 
	in our dungeon, dog.&quot;&nbsp; He came ahead cautiously.&nbsp; He could hear more guards 
	clattering up the stairs on both sides of the corridor.&nbsp; He knew then that 
	they had the assassin trapped.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The assassin grinned with mock innocence and 
	retreated to match the Prince's slow pace.&nbsp; &quot;I know you're a smart man, 
	Highness, and I'm sure you don't need me to tell you who sent me.&nbsp; In any 
	case, I work in the strictest confidentiality.&nbsp; By the way, how fares your 
	brother, the younger princeling?&quot;&nbsp; He laughed as he stepped back past the 
	door to the King's rooms, turning to make his retreat.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Varicci growled and charged forward.&nbsp; Instead 
	of running away, the assassin reversed direction, dropped down, rolled 
	forward under Varicci's guard, and threw a leg out.&nbsp; He managed to hook the 
	Prince's ankle as he rolled past.&nbsp; Varicci stumbled and reeled sideways, 
	throwing his right hand out against the wall to stop his fall. &nbsp;He kept his 
	footing, but his sword went clattering to the floor.&nbsp; Behind him, the 
	assassin yanked the door open and vanished within.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Roaring incoherently with rage, the Prince 
	grabbed his sword and charged into the room.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He turned the corner around the door in time 
	to see the assassin midway into the royal parlor with a second, smaller 
	dagger poised in his left hand.&nbsp; Time seemed to slow for Prince Varicci.&nbsp; He 
	became aware of every detail in the scene before him. &nbsp;He took note of the 
	King, his father, sitting at the great desk on the left side of the room, a 
	sheaf of documents and a tankard of beer arrayed in front of him. &nbsp;He saw 
	the assassin spin again, his left arm winding back and then uncoiling in the 
	King's direction.&nbsp; He saw the dagger twirling through the air, and he could 
	tell it was flying directly at his father's throat.&nbsp; He saw his father reach 
	out...</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a horrible noise of metal grating 
	on metal as King Varicci I swatted the dagger with his silver beer tankard. 
	The blade struck the tankard square and sunk into the heavy silver, halfway 
	to its hilt.&nbsp; The King's expression was equal parts shock, outrage, and 
	terror.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Regrettable,&quot; the assassin sighed.&nbsp; He 
	looked between the King and the Prince and shrugged almost apologetically.&nbsp; 
	Then he shook his head, laughing, and ran for the back of the room, to the 
	great open windows overlooking the palace courtyard.&nbsp; The shutters had been 
	drawn open, and the red and gold drapery stirred softly in the early evening 
	winds.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Varicci started forward to pursue, then 
	stopped as four crossbow-wielding palace guards burst in through the door.&nbsp; 
	As one, they leveled their weapons at the fleeing assassin and fired.&nbsp; The 
	bolts whirred through the room and flew out the window.&nbsp; The assassin was 
	gone.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">******</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning, Captain Lugo of the Royal 
	Guard reported to the throne room.&nbsp; He knelt in front of the throne, not 
	daring to raise his eyes to the King and Prince in front of him.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What news, Captain?&quot; the King asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Our huntsmen and trackers pursued the 
	assassin through the night, Majesty.&nbsp; He was a difficult quarry.&nbsp; Several 
	times, we thought we had lost his trail, only to find it by luck or 
	happenstance.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Luck or happenstance, Captain?&quot;&nbsp; The Prince 
	sneered.&nbsp; &quot;We have some fine trackers, but if you lost this man's trail, you 
	found it again because he <i>wanted</i> you to find it.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Erm, yes, Your Highness.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;So you have him in custody,&quot; the King 
	concluded.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lugo paused a moment, dreading his next 
	answer.&nbsp; &quot;The assassin... eluded us, Majesty.&quot;&nbsp; He swallowed nervously, and 
	waited in a dreadful silence for several seconds.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We are displeased, Captain,&quot; the King 
	rumbled.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;How did he escape your men, Captain?&quot; the 
	Prince asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We thought we had run him to ground in a 
	small village in one of our Aluvian territories, Highness, but... he 
	escaped.&nbsp; Through a portal.&nbsp; A portal we had not previously catalogued, 
	Highness.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I hope you had the sense to establish a 
	guard around this portal, Captain,&quot; the Prince said.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I did so immediately, Highness,&quot; Lugo 
	reported, plainly relieved he had done something right.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You will take us to that portal tomorrow,&quot; 
	the King ordered.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yes, Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Any other news, then?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We found a body in the back of a stable, 
	Majesty,&quot; the guardsman reported.&nbsp; &quot;At an inn on the eastern edge of the 
	city.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Whose body?&quot; the Prince asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;He has not been identified as yet, Your 
	Highness,&quot; the guard answered.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The King sighed.&nbsp; &quot;We are disappointed <i>
	again</i>, Captain.&nbsp; This incompetence is unlike you.&nbsp; And if my son is 
	right, this assassin was merely toying with your trackers.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Father,&quot; the Prince said, &quot;in Captain Lugo's 
	defense, this was a meticulously staged assassination attempt.&nbsp; Objectively, 
	I have to express... admiration for this assassin's skill.&nbsp; Lugo was merely 
	outwitted by a superior intellect.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The King snorted.&nbsp; &quot;I am glad you find so 
	much to admire in this murderous dog, my son.&nbsp; I imagine your admiration for 
	him would be that much greater had he succeeded in his attempt.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Father, it is wise to respect the talents of 
	one's adversaries.&nbsp; Had he not had the misfortune of choosing the worst 
	target in the world... why yes, I would probably find him an incredibly 
	useful man.&nbsp; Probably as useful as you once found Bellenesse.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Father and son shared a long look.&nbsp; Everyone 
	else in the room grew increasingly uncomfortable as the two stared at each 
	other – the King stone-faced and unblinking, the Prince with a careless grin 
	on his face.&nbsp; Finally, the Prince averted his eyes, and the King snorted 
	again.&nbsp; He turned his attention back to the kneeling guard captain.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;All right, Lugo, what <i>can</i> you tell us 
	about this body in the inn, then?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;A young man of no discernible family or 
	breeding, with his hair cut like a servant.&nbsp; He had nothing on him but his 
	clothes and a dagger of no particular note.&nbsp; All of the inn's guests in the 
	last three days have been accounted for... Except for one.&nbsp; The innkeeper 
	said he saw someone ride in from the east last night and go directly to the 
	stable.&nbsp; But he never came into the inn itself, and left after half an 
	hour.&nbsp; He assumed it was a traveler who just stopped in to water his horse.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Prince shook his head.&nbsp; &quot;Bring that fool 
	of an innkeeper here.&nbsp; Make him explore his memories <i>very</i> 
	thoroughly.&nbsp; I suspect the man who went in and the man who came out were 
	different men... And that the man who came out is the man who tried to kill 
	you, father... The man that our loyal and capable captain has thus far 
	failed to track down.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The guard captain, still kneeling, paled.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What more can you tell us of the body, 
	Lugo?&quot; the King asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;He was killed yesterday, as far as we can 
	tell, Majesty.&nbsp; One single well-placed dagger strike, at the base of the 
	spine.&nbsp; A narrow blade.&nbsp; And the wound, we believe, was poisoned.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I would wager,&quot; said the Prince, &quot;that it is 
	the same poison that was on that blade you caught with the tankard, father.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The King sighed.&nbsp; &quot;My son murdered like a dog 
	in a duel.&nbsp; A poisoned dagger, meant for my throat.&nbsp; One dead steward in the 
	castle basement.&nbsp; And now a mysterious body in a stable.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Father, I must ask again why we are going 
	over evidence when we know exactly who is behind this assassination 
	attempt.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I refuse to believe that Bellenesse himself 
	has betrayed me, my son,&quot; said the King.&nbsp; &quot;It is possible his daughter acted 
	on her own.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Possible, but unlikely.&nbsp; The Duke commands
