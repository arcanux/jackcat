		<em><font size="2" face="Arial">From the journal of Carlo di Cenza</font></em><p>
		<font size="2" face="Arial">In our time here, we have come across 
		several different species of creature, most of which have proven 
		extremely hostile. We have faced monsters imbued with undead life, 
		ethereal beings composed of magical energies, and strange humanoid 
		creatures that wage war with clubs and spears. But the most interesting 
		foe we have faced is the Ruschk. </font></p>

		<a target="_blank" href="ruschk1.htm">
		<img height="130" alt="" src="200.jpg" width="100"></a><br>
		</font><strong><font size="1">Concept Art<br>
		<i>Click to Enlarge</i></font></strong></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ruschk are a race of shamanic 
		warriors who make their homes deep within the icebergs and mountains of 
		the cold islands. Unlike the other creatures we've fought, the Ruschk 
		appear to be quite intelligent, though our few efforts at communication 
		have ended swiftly and violently. The Ruschk attack on sight; they have 
		no interest in peaceful negotiation.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ruschk wear little in the way of 
		armor. What they do wear tends to be made of animal skins. They keep 
		their faces covered and wear their hair in a sort of topknot. They adorn 
		themselves with jewelry made of bones and teeth. They fight with weapons 
		forged from ice. Somehow, these weapons are hard as steel. We have yet 
		to discover a method of shattering - or even scratching - these 
		ice-forged arms. We suspect they may have been imbued with some type of 
		magic, though our mages can detect no trace of it.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Ruschk were discovered by a group of 
		knights who were exploring the Isle of Ruin. After days of travel, they 
		were beset by a violent blizzard and were forced to make camp in a cave 
		carved into the side of a glacier. The cave appeared to be shallow at 
		first, but a quick search turned up a thin sheet of ice that served as 
		some sort of doorway. The knights shattered the ice and discovered a 
		cavern that delved quite deep into the iceberg.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our knights only made it a few steps in 
		before the Ruschk lunged from the shadows. They gave no warning cry; 
		they simply attacked. Our knights had no choice but to defend 
		themselves. Several of our knights were slaughtered in the first rush of 
		the fierce creatures. However, the few who remained were able to 
		successfully fight off the Ruschk. In a battle which could only have 
		lasted a few seconds, they managed to kill all seven of the Ruschk who 
		inhabited that cave. But before the last was killed, it spoke. Its words 
		were foreign and its dialect thick, but it clearly spoke some form of 
		language. The soldiers were unable to remember much of what it said, but 
		the word &quot;Ruschk&quot; was spoken several times. And so that is what we call 
		them.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, that last Ruschk was 
		unwilling to lay down its arms, though our knights halted their attacks 
		once the creature began to speak. Despite the fact that it was the last 
		of its tribe and had no hope of victory, it still pressed its attack. It 
		seems these creatures know nothing of surrender. Our knights had no 
		choice but to slay the fiend.&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The knights delved deeper into the cave 
		and discovered many items that appeared to be religious in significance. 
		Shrines and totems littered the cave. A host of the Ruschk ice weapons 
		were placed on display on the cave walls. But the most startling 
		discovery was the book. The knights found a large, leather-bound tome 
		deep within the cave. It is filled with hundreds of pages of brittle, 
		yellowed paper and covered in strange symbols that we've never seen 
		before. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Have we finally found the beings that 
		created this archipelago's mysterious structures? Are they the keepers 
		of the strange, magical secrets of this world? What knowledge could they 
		impart to us if we could just find a way to communicate with them?</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Duke has spent many days studying the 
		tome, though he has yet to translate any of its arcane writings. I 
		helped him decipher many an ancient Roulean and Milantean text on Ispar, 
		and so he asked for my assistance. I fear I was of little help, though. 
		These strange symbols were beyond my understanding. However, I am 
		certain that if we continue with our efforts, we will one day uncover 
		the book's arcane mysteries. Until then, we just have to hope that the 
		Ruschk are content to let us live in peace.</font></p>
