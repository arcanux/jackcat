    <td valign="top" width="440"><em><font size="2" face="Arial">by Dave 
	&quot;Crowley&quot; Javier</font></em><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal ibn Qamuz 
	of Nishadina, the most prosperous book-seller in the greatest city of 
	Gharu'n, approached the Old City gate, leading his servants alongside a 
	great wooden wagon that creaked loudly under its load of crates.&nbsp; His old 
	friend Jamid, duty captain for the morning shift of gate guards, came 
	forward to meet him.&nbsp; As they embraced, Talal slipped a pouch of coins into 
	Jamid's hand with practiced ease.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;My old friend.&nbsp; How is your wife?&quot; Talal 
	asked.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;She is well, and sends her greetings.&quot;&nbsp; 
	Jamid responded, quickly dropping the pouch into his tunic.&nbsp; &quot;And how does 
	your family fare?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal smiled broadly.&nbsp; &quot;My wife carries 
	another child, and Salaya is apprenticing to a swordsmith next fall.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Congratulations, my friend!&quot; &nbsp;Jamid slapped 
	Talal on the back.&nbsp; Then, seeming to remember that he was on official duty, 
	he straightened up and took an officious tone, looking at the overloaded 
	wagon.&nbsp; &quot;What are you bringing out today?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;One thousand copies of a text on the 
	alchemical applications of quicksilver, by the Roulean sage Solaphon.&quot;&nbsp; 
	Talal handed over his bill of lading, signed by the chief of the guild of 
	bookbinders.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jamid whistled.&nbsp; &quot;One thousand copies.&nbsp; Many, 
	many copies.&nbsp; Now I see why the bookbinders' guild has hired so many 
	novices.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded.&nbsp; &quot;The Malika has decreed that 
	the Houses of Learning must expand their alchemical instruction to include 
	the writings of the Rouleans.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The young Malika, it seems to me, spends too 
	much time ransacking the libraries of the Rouleans and not enough time 
	absorbing the wisdom of the Poet.&nbsp; I still cannot believe how many men and 
	beasts it took to cart all of those books out of Tirethas before its fall.&quot;&nbsp; 
	Jamid shook his head regretfully.&nbsp; &quot;A pure heart, a clear eye, a strong arm 
	and a steady hand – that is what will win our war, not dusty books of a dead 
	empire.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Poet extolled the virtues of learning, 
	my friend,&quot; Talal pointed out, &quot;and told us never to disregard any source of 
	wisdom.&nbsp; Was it not to protect those very libraries that he struck down his 
	lord?&nbsp; The translators tell me they have been tasked with finding texts that 
	would help in any way against the Viamontian hordes.&nbsp; So the libraries may 
	hold the key to the survival of Gharu'n.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jamid held his hands out in a placating 
	gesture.&nbsp; &quot;I meant no criticism.&nbsp; I speak mostly out of jealousy, because my 
	old head has taken too many blows to be able to hold much learning.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both men laughed.&nbsp; &quot;It has been too long 
	since we shared bread,&quot; said Talal.&nbsp; &quot;Will you and your wife come to my home 
	for the evening meal?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Nothing would give me greater –&quot; Jamid broke 
	off as he saw a woman in brightly enameled Amuli armor, bearing the 
	ceremonial mace of an officer in service to the Malika herself, walking 
	towards them.&nbsp; She was followed by four very large guards.&nbsp; None of them 
	were familiar to Jamid, who had been in the Old City detail for twenty 
	years.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am Maulana Qazea bint Diyas,&quot; the newcomer 
	announced.&nbsp; &quot;I am a Captain of the Malika's Hands, and the new commander of 
	the guards of the Old City quarter here in Nishadina.&nbsp; Who is the duty 
	sergeant here?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jamid held up a hand.&nbsp; &quot;I am the duty 
	sergeant, Your Worship,&quot; he said, respectful of the noble's title.&nbsp; &quot;How may 
	I help you?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Qazea glanced at Talal's wagon full of 
	crates.&nbsp; Gesturing towards it with the mace, she asked, &quot;Has this wagon been 
	searched yet?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal stiffened in nervousness.&nbsp; Quickly 
	glancing between his friend and this new authority figure, Jamid nodded.&nbsp; &quot;I 
	inspected it, Your Worship.&nbsp; One thousand copies of a Roulean book of 
	alchemy, for the Malika's Houses of Learning.&quot;&nbsp; He handed her the bill of 
	lading.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Qazea looked plainly skeptical.&nbsp; &quot;This wagon 
	left the Bookbinders' Guild only twenty minutes ago.&nbsp; How could you have 
	searched all these crates? My men will search it again.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With that, the four burly guards started 
	hauling crates off the wagon, as Talal and Jamid watched helplessly.&nbsp; 
	Despite their imperious demeanor, the guards took care not to jostle or drop 
	the crates.&nbsp; They methodically set each container on the ground, pried it 
	open with a thick-bladed knife, and investigated its contents.&nbsp; Without 
	fail, each crate held fifty neatly packed copies of the Solaphon alchemical 
	text.&nbsp; Finally, all the boxes but one were off the wagon and neatly stacked 
	by the gate.&nbsp; The one remaining crate on the wagon had been the most deeply 
	buried under the pile, and the guards reached out to unload it.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Resigned to his fate, Talal let out a soft 
	sigh.&nbsp; He began to bid a mental farewell to his family.&nbsp; He also looked 
	regretfully towards Jamid, who would no doubt die under the Malika's law as 
	well, for lying to an officer of the Hand on his behalf.&nbsp; Jamid merely 
	blinked once, very slowly, and tightened his mouth.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The lid came off of the final crate, and 
	Qazea lifted out a book.&nbsp; It was not a freshly bound copy of the Solaphon 
	text.&nbsp; It was an old book, bound in leather, well preserved in the dry 
	desert climate.&nbsp; The writing embossed in gold on its cover was Old Roulean.&nbsp; 
	Qazea nodded in satisfaction and gestured to the guards.&nbsp; The four guards 
	grabbed the arms of Talal and Jamid, and forced them to kneel on the road 
	before their leader.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brandishing the book in one hand, clutching 
	her mace in the other, Qazea stood in front of the two men.&nbsp; &quot;For the crime 
	of smuggling, you are both sentenced to hang in madness cages until such 
	time as the Malika grants you mercy.&quot;&nbsp; Jamid snorted.&nbsp; Everyone knew the 
	Malika's pardon usually came long after the occupant of a madness cage had 
	withered to bones.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">********</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Creaking and howling.&nbsp; That was all he had 
	heard for days.&nbsp; The creak of the cage as it hung on its chain, and the howl 
	of the nigh constant desert winds through the high, isolated canyon.&nbsp; A 
	little while ago, he thought he'd heard a human scream, a wail of despair 
	that may have been the voice of Jamid.&nbsp; Then again, it might have been 
	nothing at all.&nbsp; Talal had been imprisoned in the madness cage for three 
	days, though it would have surprised him to learn that. He had not bothered 
	to keep track of the days or hours.&nbsp; He had not even bothered to count how 
	many of the small water gourds he had drunk, nor was he aware of the fact 
	that he had been given one per day. Talal had resigned himself to death the 
	moment they shut the cage on him. No man emerged from a madness cage. Not in 
	any form that one might still consider human.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun was about to reach its hottest 
	point.&nbsp; His skin was already blistering and peeling.&nbsp; There was shade for 
	only half the day in the canyon.&nbsp; Looking at the small gourd that was his 
	current water ration, he licked his lips and sighed, then pushed it between 
	the metal bars of the cage.&nbsp; He heard it crack and splash as it hit the 
	rocks on the canyon floor below.&nbsp; If death were on its way, let it come 
	swiftly. A sudden wind kicked up, as if in response, and drove hot desert 
	sand into his eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The wind died down after a few minutes.&nbsp; It 
	was then, with his eyes throbbing and his skin scraped freshly raw by the 
	blown-about grit, that he heard the muted thump of hoofbeats on sand.&nbsp; He 
	closed his eyes, convinced this was some aural mirage.&nbsp; He imagined the 
	sound of multiple horses, and the comforting whine of wagon wheels turning 
	on their axles.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hoofbeats and axle-creaking came close 
	and stopped.&nbsp; Then Talal heard and felt the door to his cage creak open.&nbsp; 
	Not daring to hope, he kept his eyes closed.&nbsp; He whimpered and murmured as 
	rough hands grabbed hold of his perforated skin, pulled him out of the cage, 
	and carried his unresisting body to what felt like the back of a wagon.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few minutes into the ride, Talal ventured 
	to open his eyes.&nbsp; The wagon and a group of escort riders were on a road 
	through the desert that was more like a less rocky and less scrubby path 
	than any real attempt at road-building.&nbsp; Up ahead, barely visible, was an 
	oasis he didn't recognize and a very large, but unmarked, tent.&nbsp; All around 
	the oasis were soldiers, horses, pack animals, and a heaping stack of... 
	more crates.&nbsp; All of the soldiers wore the enameled armor of the Malika's 
	Hands.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal decided to close his eyes and just hope 
	for the best.&nbsp; He played near-dead for the benefit of his captors, as well 
	as to recover his own strength.&nbsp; The wagon came to a jarring halt.&nbsp; Hands 
	reached out and lifted him once again. &nbsp;But this time the hands were clothed 
	in metal mail, and they carried him slowly out of the wagon.&nbsp; After a 
	moment, the heat on his face became less intense, and less light struck at 
	his closed eyelids, leading him to conclude that he'd been carried into the 
	large tent.&nbsp; He was laid down on a bed of cushions, and he soon felt soft, 
	delicate hands spreading cool ointments over his burned and nearly flayed 
	skin.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A vessel was held to his lips, and he sipped 
	cool water.&nbsp; He drank hesitantly at first, and then in gulps that spilled 
	down his neck, chin, and chest.&nbsp; He opened his eyes and saw a beautiful 
	young girl holding a bowl to his mouth.&nbsp; Refusing to look in his eyes, she 
	set the bowl down, wet a cloth, and gently cleaned the caked-on grit from 
	his face.&nbsp; The touch of even a soft cloth made him weep with pain, but the 
	simple care and attention after so much time in the madness cage nearly 
	broke his heart with joy.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal was just beginning to feel normal 
	again, and just beginning to wonder just what fate had planned for him, when 
	a bell sounded from outside the tent. &nbsp;The girl stopped washing his face, 
	bowed quickly and left, leaving the cloth and the bowl of water by his side.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A figure appeared at the opening of the tent, 
	at first just a shadow that sparkled with gems.&nbsp; The figure moved closer, 
	and Talal finally made out a face: a grim-faced young woman, with sharp 
	nose, thin lips, and proud chin.&nbsp; The high and arrogant posture of a noble, 
	born to command...&nbsp; A royal circlet about her brow...&nbsp; Two soldiers with the 
	distinctive helmets of royal bodyguards appeared behind the figure.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With more energy than he knew he had, Talal 
	scrambled from his prone position to kneel before the Malika of Gharu'n.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Majesty,&quot; he croaked, &quot;I tremble in your 
	presence and thank you for your mercy to a wretched criminal.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a long pause.&nbsp; &nbsp;Talal didn't dare 
	sit up, even when he felt the blood from his wounded back trickle forward 
	over his neck.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, the Malika spoke softly.&nbsp; &quot;I bid 
	you, sit comfortably, Talal ibn Qamuz.&nbsp; You may look upon me directly.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hesitating, Talal rearranged himself to sit 
	cross-legged before the ruler of Gharu'n.&nbsp; The Malika herself sat an arm's 
	length away, crossing her legs under her heavy, brocaded robes and placing 
	her hands coolly on her knees.&nbsp; The ludicrousness of his position, parched 
	and burned and in audience with the cross-legged Malika, did not escape 
	Talal.&nbsp; He almost laughed in nervous wonder, ready to dismiss the entire 
	episode as a febrile death dream.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;By my own laws, Talal, you should be dead.&nbsp; 
	You and all your family.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That brought him out of his dazed 
	bemusement.&nbsp; Talal nodded silently.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You were caught smuggling ancient books out 
	of the archive of the Old City.&nbsp; Books that were ordained by my father's 
	fathers as royal property.&nbsp; Books that were carried, at great risk and 
	expense, out of the great archives of Tirethas.&nbsp; Hundreds of the sons and 
	daughters of Gharu'n died, merely to delay those bull-worshipping savages 
	long enough to cover the flight of our wagons.&nbsp; You have stolen, from me and 
	from the nation.&nbsp; This is no simple thievery, Talal.&nbsp; This... is treason.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal abased himself again.&nbsp; &quot;My crime is 
	inexcusable, Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Tell me, Talal.&nbsp; For whom were your books 
	intended?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;They were for sale to nobles of Viamont, 
	Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;So you have stolen the books of the City of 
	Lore from my library, to sell to the very invader lords who threaten the 
	Gharu'n nation.&nbsp; You would defile the blood of our war dead to sell the 
	books back to the very jackals who sought to plunder them.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal quivered, barely able to speak.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, 
	Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This has been going on for some time, I 
	gather.&nbsp; Since even before the Viamontians took Tirethas.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;S-several years, Majesty.&nbsp; B-before they 
	attacked Gharu'n.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;And yet, after they invaded, you kept your 
	hand in their purses.&nbsp; You must have felt like you would never be caught.&quot;&nbsp; 
	With no comment from Talal, the Malika went on.&nbsp; &quot;You would not have been 
	caught, either, except that someone told the Zharalim about your 
	activities.&nbsp; They were told of the methods you use to smuggle the books out 
	of the archives, and given the name of your friend, the foolish old guard.&nbsp; 
	You were compromised by Hamzir ibn Hamzir.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal was unable to keep his head down, 
	shocked by this news.&nbsp; He looked up at the Malika in pure surprise, before 
	bowing his head again.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This was unexpected, yes?&nbsp; In your secret 
	and lucrative profession, even rivals do not violate the smugglers' code.&nbsp; 
	Do not betray each other to the Malika's justice.&nbsp; Is this true?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded miserably.&nbsp; Through his despair 
	over his crime and his fate, he felt anger swelling within him.&nbsp; Hamzir ibn 
	Hamzir had once been his assistant!&nbsp; He had trained Hamzir, and let him 
	start his own book-smuggling business without retaliation!</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Hamzir attempted to keep his hand hidden.&nbsp; 
	He sent intermediaries of intermediaries to deliver an anonymous 
	accusation.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal let out a low moan of rage and 
	frustration.&nbsp; The Malika chuckled, then seemed to catch herself.&nbsp; &quot;I do not 
	mock your pain, Talal ibn Qamuz.&nbsp; I merely laugh at Hamzir's conceit.&nbsp; To 
	believe that he could cloak himself from the Shagar Zharala...&nbsp; The 
	assassins are not the force they once were, it is true, but their 
	investigative techniques are still potent enough to penetrate the 
	smokescreens of a stupid young book smuggler!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika snapped a finger at one of her 
	guards, who bowed and left the tent.&nbsp; The ruler then turned her attention 
	back to Talal.&nbsp; &quot;Tell me the names of your clients... these crude, 
	blue-skinned predators who batter our gates and steal away the treasures of 
	our libraries.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Uh... Well, Countess Lotila... Count Renari... 
	Duke Bellenesse...&quot; The Malika listened as Talal listed every Viamontian 
	noble he had done business with since he began smuggling books to Viamont.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Bellenesse... The one who slew the Emperor 
	himself...&quot;&nbsp; The Malika paused, lost in her own thoughts.&nbsp; Talal hunkered 
	down respectfully, unsure whether or not the mention of the Duke's name had 
	caused him to fatally offend the Malika.&nbsp; Finally, she smiled and looked 
	back at him.&nbsp; &quot;That will do nicely.&nbsp; You have dealt with these nobles for 
	many years.&nbsp; They trust you to bring them remarkable and noteworthy books?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yes, Majesty.&nbsp; I have learned what interests 
	them... and their followers.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I have something that will interest them 
	greatly.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Surprised again by another incongruity, Talal 
	lifted his head.&nbsp; He saw the guard who had departed come back to the 
	Malika's side, holding a thin book, bound in rich red leather.&nbsp; The guard 
	handed it to the Malika, who dropped it in the dirt in front of Talal.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Go ahead, pick it up.&quot;&nbsp; The Malika gestured 
	impatiently.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal picked up the book and inspected its 
	cover.&nbsp; Muttering the Old Roulean words to himself, he translated the title 
	into his own language.&nbsp; &quot;The... Treatise of the... Individual... by Lokios 
	of Tirethas.&quot;&nbsp; His breath left him. He looked up at the Malika for but a 
	moment, then quickly dropped his eyes once again to the treasure which she 
	had so casually tossed into the desert sand. &quot;The Treatise of the 
	Individual,&quot; he muttered to himself, and wiped away the tears from his eyes.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yes.&nbsp; That book... rumored to exist, but 
	never found, correct?&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded, unable to speak.&nbsp; This single 
	book, sold to the right buyer, would be worth as much as an entire crate of 
	lesser texts.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;No one has ever read it, but to an expert on 
	Roulean texts... This is the crown jewel, yes?&nbsp; All the ancient sages wrote 
	of this great work and the revolutionary ideas of the Philosopher, Lokios.&nbsp; 
	And how, after writing it, Lokios left Tirethas to wander the world, and was 
	never heard from again. &nbsp;You... of course, know why it was believed to be 
	lost...&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded his head. The Malika had hit 
	upon a subject on which he prided himself an expert. &quot;The Roulean emperors 
	suppressed it and had all known copies burned to ash, Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika nodded.&nbsp; &quot;I have read that book.&nbsp; 
	Several times, actually.&nbsp; It contains some dangerous ideas.&nbsp; Or at least, 
	ideas dangerous to the kind of thoughtless, brutal, morally bankrupt regime 
	that the Emperors maintained.&nbsp; So you may be curious how it survived their 
	decree of destruction.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded again.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, very curious, 
	Majesty.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika laughed.&nbsp; &quot;The Emperors of Roulea 
	were not complete savages, after all.&nbsp; A few copies survived in their 
	personal vaults.&nbsp; They retained enough respect for knowledge in their 
	debased minds to keep them from permanently destroying any work of human 
	thought, even one so dangerous as this.&nbsp; So when my father's fathers took 
	Tirethas so many years ago, these books came to light.&nbsp; The Poet himself 
	came upon them, and it was at his urging that the books were placed in the 
	royal archives.&nbsp; They even survived the Age of Smoke and Shadow, when our 
	royal line dispersed and the Viamontians placed their puppets on our 
	throne.&quot;&nbsp; She spat on the ground to commemorate the time of the Viamontian 
	interregnum.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal ran his hands over the binding, still 
	afraid to even open the book.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;You might notice, Talal, that the book is 
	new.&nbsp; I would not have brought one of the originals to you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sudden realization came to Talal as he 
	remembered the crates of books outside. Slowly, he looked at the Malika, 
	fear growing in his wind-burnt eyes.&nbsp; The Malika merely smiled at him, 
	clearly enjoying the his reaction.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, Talal.&nbsp; My scribes have made many 
	copies of this book. &nbsp;One thousand of them.&nbsp; They are right outside this 
	tent, as a matter of fact.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika leaned close.&nbsp; &quot;I have come to 
	offer you more than you could have hoped for, Talal ibn Qamuz.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come 
	to offer you mercy, revenge, and a job.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal abased himself again.&nbsp; &quot;I will do 
	whatever you command me, Great Malika.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Then listen carefully, for I will give you 
	these instructions only once.&nbsp; After that, I wish never to see you again.&nbsp; 
	Nor will I acknowledge ever meeting you.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal nodded emphatically, groveling.&nbsp; The 
	Malika watched him for a long moment, then continued.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;First, I will give you your revenge.&nbsp; Hamzir 
	ibn Hamzir will be punished for his own smuggling, as well as his 
	duplicity.&nbsp; He and all his line will be extinguished, because I find his 
	betrayal of his benefactor, even within the murk of your illicit trade, to 
	be shameful and unworthy of a son of Gharu'n.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Talal clenched his fists in bitter triumph.&nbsp; 
	&quot;Your Majesty shows great wisdom in her judgment, and generosity to this 
	criminal, who is worthy only of your loathing.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika smiled faintly.&nbsp; &quot;And you, Talal 
	ibn Qamuz, will be banished forever from Gharu'n.&nbsp; Your life will be spared, 
	and you will be sent across the Ironsea to sell these thousand books.&nbsp; Go to 
	Viamont, Talal, and peddle the forbidden text to their nobles and merchant 
	lords.&nbsp; In return, I will show leniency to your friend the guard and I will 
	provide for the welfare of your family.&nbsp; It is many lives I spare, Talal, 
	because I want you to be very eager to sell these books.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Blubbering with gratitude, Talal crawled 
	forward and kissed the Malika's foot.&nbsp; She paused to allow him his gesture 
	of submission, then went on.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;But should you cross me, Talal ibn Qamuz... 
	Be aware that the reach of the Shagar Zharala extends all the way into 
	Viamont, to the city of Corcosa itself.&nbsp; I will know if you fail to live up 
	to the spirit of our agreement.&nbsp; And if you displease me, I will kill your 
	wife, your children, your brothers and sisters and cousins.&nbsp; I will kill 
	their children, and their children's children... To the third generation.&quot;&nbsp; 
	The Malika paused to allow time for Talal's stricken mind to absorb her 
	words. &nbsp;When she saw the tears in his eyes, she knew that he understood.
	</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Sell every last book.&nbsp; Play the merchant's 
	game.&nbsp; Haggle with them, get a good price for each...&nbsp; If you sell them too 
	cheaply, they will doubt your sincerity, or the book's legitimacy.&nbsp; But each 
	book must find its way into blue-skinned hands.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Malika stood with one swift, graceful 
	motion and regarded Talal coldly.&nbsp; &quot;Thus ends our interview, Talal.&nbsp; There 
	are people waiting outside to take you to Corcosa.&nbsp; Enjoy this last journey 
	to the coast, because you will never again see the lands of Gharu'n.&quot;&nbsp; With 
	that, she left the tent.&nbsp; The flap closed behind her, leaving Talal weeping 
	softly in the cool darkness.</font></p>
