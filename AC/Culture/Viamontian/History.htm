    <td valign="top" width="440"><font face="Arial" size="2"><em>by Salizim ibn 
	Salaq, Sage of Nishadina</em></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">As much 
	as it is possible to generalize about the character of an entire nation, the 
	Viamontians, to put it mildly, are a proud and aggressive people.&nbsp; They 
	glory in battle and conquest, driven by the ambitions of their lords and by 
	a widespread love of combat and all its trappings.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Their history reads as a litany of battles, 
	great and small, from clan squabbles over a herd of livestock to their 
	massive campaigns of foreign conquest.&nbsp; The sources of their eternal war can 
	be found in their earliest history.&nbsp; Their successes in war can perhaps be 
	traced to their semi-mythical &quot;Blood-Father,&quot; a man named Karlun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Long after the Rouleans had brought imperial 
	order to the lands around the Ironsea, the tribes that would become the 
	nations of Viamont and Aluvia remained chaotic and disorganized.&nbsp; The 
	Viamontian peninsula, which the Rouleans saw no benefit in conquering, was 
	home to a collection of independent tribes who spent most of their time 
	warring over territory and livestock.&nbsp; In general, these tribes were 
	organized around clans and ruled by a hereditary clan chieftain.&nbsp; Relations 
	between these tribes were characterized by unstable alliances, opportunistic 
	treachery, and vicious blood feuds.&nbsp; The most successful clans were led by 
	chieftains who were not only mighty warriors, but also cunning politicians.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most notably, however, the clans within 
	themselves seemed to be free of serious internal dissension.&nbsp; All citations 
	of the deaths of clan heads are attributed to war with other clans, natural 
	causes, or misadventure.&nbsp; There are no great stories of, say, an ambitious 
	nephew or cousin killing and supplanting a chieftain.&nbsp; Successors to failing 
	or dying clan chiefs were usually named by the incumbent, or anointed in 
	ritualized trial by combat.&nbsp; The Viamontian national character, while quite 
	bellicose, also seems to be strongly characterized by insular devotion to 
	one's leader.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Though no single tribe ever gained supremacy 
	over the others in these times, a handful did establish themselves as the 
	&quot;elite&quot; tribes – controlling the best lands and maintaining the largest 
	livestock herds, and keeping their status for a number of generations.&nbsp; It 
	is worth noting the names of some of these tribes, such as the Bellenni, 
	Lotili, and Furzi, because their names survive as some of the mightier noble 
	houses in Viamont now.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One tribe in particular, however, became an 
	agent of great change in the region several hundred years ago.&nbsp; These events 
	occurred far enough in the past that no truly reliable documentation exists, 
	so what we must draw conclusions based on stories and lore passed on through 
	an oral tradition.&nbsp; The Corcosi were a tribe which controlled some of the 
	best pasturelands, as well as a natural port on the southern coast of the 
	peninsula.&nbsp; They were wealthy and their lands well-defended, but possessed 
	neither the strength nor the inclination to challenge the Bellenni or the 
	Lotili.&nbsp; They were not particularly warlike by the standards of their time, 
	and had forged a series of reasonably stable trade relationships with other 
	tribes.&nbsp; They had gone so far as to establish small outposts along the 
	coasts and rivers to serve as ports.&nbsp; They could be considered the most 
	diplomatically inclined tribe of their time. &nbsp;However, the Corcosi became 
	something quite different when a stranger named Karlun appeared in their 
	midst.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not much is known about Karlun besides surely 
	exaggerated mythic accounts of his physical and mental prowess.&nbsp; He is known 
	in Viamontian lore as the Great Bull, which does little to illuminate him 
	because the tribal totem of the Corcosi, great cattle breeders that they 
	were, was the bull.&nbsp; There is no documentation of his origin, but he was 
	certainly not a native of the Viamontian peninsula.&nbsp; What is known is that, 
	in very short order, he took over as chieftain of the Corcosi tribe in 
	unprecedented fashion.&nbsp; Soon after, the Corcosi leveraged their trade 
	connections into military alliances with other tribes and began a 
	breathtakingly swift and effective campaign to unite them under his rule.&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fortunately for historians, reliable records 
	of this time do exist.&nbsp; As part of his program of unification, Karlun had 
	brought learning and literacy (at least among the noble lines) to Viamont.&nbsp; 
	It is also worth noting that Viamontian magical practice, which had 
	previously been a shamanic form dependent upon tribal totem animals, evolved 
	into a variant of the familiar and almost-universal Four Schools.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Through conquest, diplomacy, and treachery, 
	Karlun managed to bring most of the other tribes under his leadership within 
	one generation.&nbsp; Karlun's sucessors - his children and grandchildren - 
	continued the subjugation of Viamont through marriages with the other clans, 
	and began to style themselves a royal line.&nbsp; The blood of Karlun is what the 
	Viamontians believe to be the element that distinguishes them from any of 
	the other nations of Ispar, and that is the reason they refer to all 
	outsiders as &quot;the Bloodless.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There were a few proud tribes, however, that 
	resisted the unification.&nbsp; Predictably, the resistance was comprised largely 
	of the powerful tribes who had the most to lose from bowing to a central 
	authority.&nbsp; Most notable among these tribes were the aforementioned Bellenni 
	and Lotili.&nbsp; The resisting clans formed an alliance of their own, led 
	jointly by the shaman-wizard Bassano of the Bellenni and the warrior matron 
	Pova of the Lotili.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the first pitched battle between the two 
	sides, King Elous II, Karlun's grandson, died in personal combat with the 
	two warlords.&nbsp; This inconvenient fact was glossed over later in Viamontian 
	lore, as the houses of Bellenesse and Lotila eventually became two of the 
	most stalwart and reliably bloodthirsty houses in the later Viamontian wars 
	with foreign nations.&nbsp; Demoralized, the royalist forces broke from the 
	field, and any hope of swiftly defeating the upstart Bellenni-Lotili 
	alliance was gone.&nbsp; The ensuing civil war lasted for almost a hundred 
	years.&nbsp; Throughout the war, other tribes changed sides as it suited their 
	interests.&nbsp; The war's intensity waxed and waned, but for a century, 
	skirmishes took place more or less continuously somewhere in the peninsula.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the two sides came to a reckoning in 
	the foothills south of the royal town of Corcosa, named after the tribe over 
	whom Karlun had first established his power.&nbsp; In a battle still remembered 
	for its savagery, the leaders of the two armies pressed the fight for three 
	days, until there were not enough soldiers left standing to continue the 
	fight.&nbsp; The battle ended with the royal forces holding a tactical advantage 
	– enough to win a surrender from Bellenni and Lotili, but not enough to 
	force the sort of terms that King Elous V would have wanted – namely, the 
	total extinction of the two chief rebel tribes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the continued survival of his 
	hereditary enemies, Elous V ended his reign as no other Viamontian ruler 
	since Karlun had – he died peacefully, in his bed.&nbsp; The various tribes were 
	simply too spent from their age of civil war to continue the fight any 
	longer, and the new realm enjoyed a thirty-year period of peace.&nbsp; By the 
	time of the ascension of Elous VI, however, border wars once again ignited 
	between the lords of Viamont.&nbsp; Elous VI and the rest of the self-generated 
	royal line knew that their hold on power was vulnerable.&nbsp; They had the 
	foresight to realize that the tradition of clan conflict and constant 
	warfare, which was as old as the mountains of their homeland, would 
	inevitably break apart the new kingdom unless all that martial energy and 
	ambition could be productively directed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With that in mind, Elous VI undertook the 
	project of building a national military force. &nbsp;The most accomplished 
	warlords among the old tribal chieftains became generals in the new 
	Viamontian army.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elous quietly brought in retired generals of the Roulean 
	Empire to train his troops and instruct his generals in battle doctrine.&nbsp; 
	This was a politically risky undertaking for Elous, but by dint of his 
	personal charisma, political skill, and promises of lavish plunder to the 
	clan chiefs, he succeeded.&nbsp; What had been a patchwork confederation of 
	tribal militias, each answering only to its own chief, became a hierarchical 
	and regimented army which fought with discipline and tactical coordination.&nbsp; 
	Within the army's hierarchy, as a concession to the old ways, the tribal 
	structure was maintained – units were organized along clan lines, and each 
	soldier was personally loyal to his hereditary lord, who in turn served 
	Elous directly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Outside of their military obligations, Elous 
	VI gave his lords great latitude to maintain their own domains.&nbsp; The royal 
	line still controlled the rich ancestral lands of the Corcosi and, by virtue 
	of the Corcosi port network, held a near monopoly on the burgeoning trade 
	between Viamont and the declining, but wealthy, Roulean Empire.&nbsp; In 
	addition, to secure his own military pre-eminence against the power of the 
	lords, Elous established a war academy to make sure his own personal forces 
	were the best-trained soldiers in Viamont.&nbsp; Other lords inevitably sent 
	their own most promising soldiers to this academy, and this practice would 
	become the foundation of the fearsome Ferran Knights of later days.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The results of the first campaign of the 
	united Viamontian army are covered extensively in other histories and in 
	endless mournful Aluvian drinking songs. &nbsp;It is worth noting that the 
	conquest of Aluvia was a double success for Elous's gambit.&nbsp; The dramatic 
	Viamontian triumph over the Aluvians at Ayrifal proved the wisdom of his 
	decision to create a structured army, and the riches and glory offered by 
	the conquest sated the appetites of his lords.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With their immediate neighbor conquered and 
	safely under the rule of a puppet king, the Viamontians, in another 
	astonishing feat of adaptability, turned themselves into mariners.&nbsp; Again 
	co-opting Roulean expertise, they used the wealth and resources plundered 
	from Aluvia to build a fleet large enough to transport their armies across 
	the Ironsea.&nbsp; Thus began a wave of Viamontian military adventurism.&nbsp; 
	Viamontian corsairs raided Roulean ports around the Ironsea, while the 
	legions of the bull banner marched on Milantos and our own newly formed 
	nation of Gharu'n.&nbsp; The Milantans repelled their invasion in a horrifying 
	scorched-earth campaign, while they succeeded in our nation because of 
	instability in the succession of our Maliks.&nbsp; The people of Gharu'n &nbsp;and 
	Aluvia both eventually pushed out the Viamontian-installed puppet kings and 
	reclaimed their lands from the invader.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Viamontians' most recent campaign, under 
	King Varicci, was the most ambitious and successful yet.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, 
	the forces of Viamont issued forth from their peninsula once more and 
	launched almost simultaneous attacks on Roulea and Aluvia.&nbsp; It was clear 
	that Varicci had been biding his time and building up strength, enough to 
	conceivably sustain wars in two separate countries.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a wave of early victories, the 
	Viamontians bogged down.&nbsp; Having learned lessons from the past, the Aluvians 
	put up a tenacious resistance against the superior numbers of their old 
	foe.&nbsp; To this day the war in Aluvia continues, locked in a bloody 
	stalemate.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The tottering Roulean empire, however, 
	collapsed upon itself like a rotten fruit.&nbsp; Already weakened by the long-ago 
	loss of their trade outposts, the Rouleans were in no position to defend 
	their holdings.&nbsp; Their once proud imperial legions gathered for one last 
	great battle, which ended with the annihilation of the imperial army and the 
	Emperor murdered in his palace, pinned to his throne by a sword through the 
	chest.&nbsp; After their swift success in Roulea, the Viamontians turned 
	immediately towards Gharu'n again.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The second invasion of Gharu'n initially went 
	well for the Viamontians.&nbsp; Within two years, after a siege by sea and by 
	land, they took Tirethas.&nbsp; The fall of the City of Lore dealt a crushing 
	blow to the morale of our people.&nbsp; The Viamontians marched to the northern 
	edge of the Naqut Desert, driving our armies before them.&nbsp; Finally, our 
	resistance solidified around the city of Shiryaz, whose terraced gardens the 
	Malika so loves.&nbsp; We fought the Viamontians to a standstill there, and 
	Shiryaz remained free.&nbsp; One morning, eight years ago, the guards of the 
	northern wall looked out over the battle plain and found that the 
	Viamontians were gone.&nbsp; The great army that had camped there the previous 
	evening had vanished in the night, leaving behind only their refuse and the 
	tracks of thousands of boots, streaming north.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It took us only a day to discover what had 
	happened.&nbsp; A crisis at home compelled the recall of the Viamontian army.&nbsp; 
	The problem came from a familiar source: a direct descendant of Bassano of 
	the Bellenni.&nbsp; The Duke of Bellenesse, once King Varicci's most trusted 
	warlord, the one who had personally executed the Emperor of Roulea, has 
	turned against his master.&nbsp; Details of the political situation within 
	Viamont are always difficult to gather, but it is known that the Duke's 
	daughter treacherously slew the younger of Varicci's sons, Prince Renlen, in 
	a supposedly friendly duel.&nbsp; At the same time, the Duke launched a rebellion 
	against his King, gaining the support of several other influential lords.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Things did not go as the Duke planned, 
	largely because of the leadership of the King's elder son, Crown Prince 
	Varicci.&nbsp; After a series of royalist victories, the Crown Prince brought his 
	army into the lands of Bellenesse and laid siege to the Duke's fortress.&nbsp; In 
	that battle, facing total defeat, the Duke took his surviving vassals and 
	soldiers through a portal that had appeared within the castle.&nbsp; It did not 
	take long for the bloodthirsty Prince to take his own army through the 
	portal to continue the pursuit.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Understandably, a betrayal by his old 
	warlord, the death of his youngest son, and the disappearance of his eldest 
	son along with most of his army have blunted King Varicci's ambition.&nbsp; I 
	suppose we, the neighbors of Viamont, have the Duke to thank for that.</font></p>
