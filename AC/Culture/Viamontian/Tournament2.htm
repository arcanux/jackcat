    <td valign="top" width="440"><font size="2" face="arial">by Brandon &quot;meanbeard&quot; Salinas</font><p>
    <em><font size="2" face="arial">from the journal of Carlo di Cenza</font></em></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Shortley after Darren's murder, Lord Marden made his peace 
    with the King. He retains his position as one of Varicci's most favored and 
    loyal subjects. In fact, a tourney was held on the anniversary of Darren's 
    death in the young lord's honor. Prince Renlen made a great show of 
    expressing his regret at the outcome of the duel, but it was profoundly 
    obvious to all assembled that in his rhetoric, he never actually apologized 
    for the young lad's murder.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Two months ago, Lord Marden announced that he would hold a 
    tournament in honor of the fall of Lizistan. He summoned Knights from all 
    the duchies of the kingdom, including our own.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The Duke, however, ordered his Knights to decline the 
    invitation. The Duke has been acting odd for several months now. He has 
    ordered our Knights on several quests that seem to serve no purpose in the 
    Gharu'n and Aluvian wars. Secret raids on the manors of other lords in 
    search of &quot;illegal&quot; goods from Milantos and Souia-Vey. Secret weapons trades 
    with the Silverans of the north. Midnight rendezvous with lords and Dukes 
    who have nothing to do with the wars to the South and East.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He has also begun to espouse a whole host of strange new 
    beliefs. Three months ago, he issued a decree forbidding anyone in the duchy 
    from addressing him as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Lord.&quot; He no longer abides the kneeling and 
    head-bowing that have marked our interactions with him our entire lives. He 
    even re-fashioned the servants' quarters of his house, outfitting our 
    chambers with as much luxury and opulence as he could spare, as if we were 
    more than mere servants.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It seemed he was making a great effort to distance himself 
    from the rest of Viamontian nobility. So when he forbade us from attending 
    the tourney, none of us was especially surprised.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I <i>was</i> surprised, however, to be awakened in the 
    middle of the night a week before the tournament was set to begin. I 
    remember dreaming of the graceful Gharu'ndim dancers I had seen on my 
    travels to the South when a rough hand shook me from my slumber. I peered 
    into the gloom through bleary eyes, somewhat uncertain of my surroundings. 
    Sir Bellas looked down at me, fully outfitted in his armor. &quot;Wake up, 
    Carlo,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I have need of your service.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I blinked the haze of sleep from my eyes and nodded to my 
    Knight. I stood up, my naked flesh bristling in the cold night air. I walked 
    toward my trunk to retrieve my clothes when I noticed Eleonora standing in 
    the corner of the room. She was wrapped in a thick, fur-lined cloak. She 
    merely stood there, staring out my window. She did not notice me at all.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I looked at Sir Bellas, doing my best to convey my 
    confusion with my eyes. He put a finger to his lips, his silent signal that 
    all would be explained in time. I nodded and dressed myself. We exited into 
    the Duke's courtyard. Three horses stood waiting. We mounted our steeds and 
    trotted silently out of the fortress gates and into the night. None 
    witnessed our departure.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We were at the border of the duchy when Sir Bellas 
    informed me of our destination - Lord Marden's tournament. He did not say 
    why we were going. He did not say how he planned to appease the Duke's anger 
    at our disobedience. And he certainly did not say why Eleonora was with us. 
    He merely informed me of our destination, then fell silent once more.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The lady did not speak the entire trip. Sir Bellas spoke 
    but little - only enough to coordinate the setup and teardown of camp each 
    night.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">As we neared Marden's lands, the sky opened and poured its 
    rains upon us. Day and night it rained. The ground became muddy and thick, 
    slowing our pace to a mere crawl.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">When we reached the border of the Marden duchy, Eleonora 
    broke off from us without word or gesture. She headed into the misty forest 
    along the road and disappeared from view. Sir Bellas spared not a glance as 
    she left.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">After a few minutes, he finally spoke. &quot;Carlo, you have 
    been loyal to me for many years. You have done all that I have asked without 
    complaint and with great zeal. You have been honest and forthright to me 
    when other squires would have lied to my face. You are a good man, Carlo.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; I mumbled.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;I have kept secrets from you, Carlo.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Such is your right, sir,&quot; I replied.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He nodded. &quot;Much will be revealed in the coming days. But 
    for now, do as you have done all these years. Follow closely and move 
    quickly. Our survival depends on it.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I nodded.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">And that was it. He did not speak to me again until we 
    made camp at the tourney.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The tourney grounds appeared much like they did five years 
    ago. Knights from dozens of duchies made camp around Lord Marden's manor. 
    Hundreds of tents cluttered the fields and forests. Despite the foul 
    weather, there was much feasting and merrymaking. Were it not for Sir Bellas' 
    ominous warning, I feel certain I would have enjoyed myself. There has not 
    been much in the way of merrymaking in the Duke's house of late.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We erected a tent on the outskirts of camp and spoke to no 
    one. Neither did anyone speak to us. We were strangers here, and Sir Bellas 
    took care to hide all evidence of the Stag of Bellenesse, a fact which added 
    to my increasing unease.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We ate our dinner in silence and slept uneasily as the 
    rain pounded against the sides of our tent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The next day, we made our way through the bustling camp to 
    the tourney grounds. There was a significant crowd trying to work their way 
    into the massive tent, but few stood in the way of Sir Bellas' immense 
    frame. Even unarmored as he was, he was quite the formidable presence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We worked our way to a pair of seats in the top row of the 
    spectator stands. We seated ourselves near a group of Silverans. I've never 
    grown tired of listening to their bizarre, twisting tongue. I once tried my 
    hand at the language, but was utterly incapable of forming the words. But 
    still, I do enjoy hearing it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">We watched the tournament in relative silence. Knights 
    jousted on horse and dueled on foot. Groups of men fought mock battles 
    against one another. In one instance, Sir Gaja fought a White Bear to the 
    death - the bear's death, thankfully. Sir Bellas watched all this with 
    little enthusiasm. My curiosity about our presence here increased with each 
    match. What were we doing here? Why had we deceived the Duke? And where was 
    Eleonora?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Soon enough, my questions were answered.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Near the end of the day, Lord Marden's page announced a 
    duel between Sir Luchissi of the duchy of Filuria and a mystery knight from 
    an unnamed province. Sir Bellas leaned forward and finally took an interest 
    in the games.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Luchissi stepped onto the grounds in his Alduressa 
    plate. He was a crowd favorite, having bested three other opponents that day 
    with incredible speed and ferocity. He bowed with a flourish, to the wild 
    adulation of the crowd.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The mystery knight received far less applause. In fact, he 
    received more jeers and snickers than anything else. He was much smaller 
    than Sir Luchissi, and his armor was old and battered. An Aluvian heaume 
    awkwardly covered his head.&nbsp; He did not bow to the crowd. He merely took his 
    position, unsheathed his simple wooden sword, and stood ready.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Luchissi did not even wait for the page's signal. He 
    launched himself at the young knight, delivering a flurry of jabs and 
    strikes. The mystery knight parried them all with silken ease, dancing away 
    from the larger knight and spinning to face Luchissi's back. The mystery 
    knight went to slash Luchissi in the back, but Luchissi awkwardly leapt to 
    the side. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The smaller knight could have pressed the attack, but he 
    did not. He simply lowered his sword, turned, and walked away. When he was a 
    respectable distance from Luchissi, he turned back to the knight and readied 
    himself again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I looked at Sir Bellas and noticed that his fists were 
    clenched tight. His face was drained of color. He was almost white. I could 
    not recall a time when I had seen him so worried.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">At that point, the identity of the mystery knight became 
    incredibly obvious. I had seen that armor and sword many times before, had 
    wielded them myself on many occasions. They were used by the boys of the 
    Duke's house in combat training. When I was a younger man, I spent many days 
    in that armor, fighting and sweating in the Duke's own courtyard. I 
    understood now why Eleonora had been absent from us all this time. And I 
    understood why we had defied the Duke. He never would have agreed to his 
    daughter's participation in this tournament. Had he known that she intended 
    to fight against the knights of the realm, he surely would have locked the 
    girl in her quarters.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">But uncovering the identity of the mystery knight only 
    raised more questions. Why had Eleonora risked her father's ire to take part 
    in a tournament? Why this one, instead of some smaller tourney closer to 
    home? And why had she concealed her combat ability for so long? I certainly 
    had no idea the girl could even lift a sword, let alone fight with it. And 
    to fight with the grace that she displayed before me on the tourney floor... 
    the girl must have been training for the last five years at the least.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Luchissi bowed at his opponent. She bowed in return. 
    Then the battle renewed. This time, Luchissi attacked much more 
    conservatively. He maintained some measure of control, keeping his sword 
    close to parry her attacks. The two of them danced around one another, a 
    more graceful pair than had heretofore been witnessed at this tournament. 
    Luchissi lunged and attacked. Eleonora parried and stepped to the side. This 
    happened several times. Each time, Eleonora stepped around and behind 
    Luchissi. She could have struck him in the back any one of those times. But 
    she did not. She simply waited for Luchissi to regain his footing and turn 
    back to her. She was clearly enjoying this fight.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas, however, was not. &quot;Damn it, girl. Hit him!&quot; he 
    muttered under his breath.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Luchissi's face was purple with anger. This young, 
    unknown knight had made a fool of him, toying with him like a cat with his 
    prey. He was ready to end this fight, and fiercely, too, it seemed. He 
    roared and charged at Eleonora. He swung wildly, clearly hoping to lop the 
    poor girl's head off. But she effortlessly parried his attacks. And when she 
    saw an opening, she cracked him on the side of the head with her wooden 
    blade.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Luchissi howled in agony. He dropped his sword and 
    fell to the ground, holding his bloody head in his hands.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The crowd erupted in applause. The same audience that had 
    showered Sir Luchissi with so much praise just a few moments before now 
    cheered his defeat. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Eleonora strode to the center of the field, bowed to Lord 
    Marden, and exited the grounds. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Sir Bellas leaned close to me. &quot;Let's go,&quot; he said. We 
    stood and made our way through the cheering crowd. When we reached the 
    floor, we turned to exit. But a surge in the crowd's wild applause caught my 
    attention. I turned to see what the excitement was about, and my blood ran 
    cold.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Prince Renlen strode out to the center of the pit. His 
    armor gleamed in the tent's torchlight. His purple cape swirled about him, 
    emblazoned with the magnificent bull of Viamont. He helped Sir Luchissi to 
    his feet, then waved to the cheering crowd. That was all I saw before Sir 
    Bellas grabbed my arm and pulled me outside.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">The evening passed in tense silence. Eleonora did not 
    visit us. I wondered where she had hid herself. I wanted to ask Sir Bellas 
    what he needed from me, what exactly he had planned - though I had a pretty 
    good idea what his answer would be - but I am not in the habit of 
    questioning my betters, no matter how much of my life I have spent at their 
    sides.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It was only when I bade Sir Bellas good night that he 
    finally spoke. &quot;Carlo,&quot; he said. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">&quot;Yes, Sir Bellas?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">He looked me in the eye for the first time that night. &quot;It 
    will happen tomorrow.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I did not sleep well.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">I lay awake, listening to the rain as it pounded against 
    our tent. I despaired at the future, wondering what tragedies and horrors 
    the Lady Eleonora had in store for us. She planned to harm the prince; I was 
    certain of that. Why else would we have traveled so far to this tournament, 
    when if all she wanted was to fight as a man, she could have attended any 
    number of smaller tournaments in our own lands? What would her father think 
    of such treason? Surely the King would demand her head, if we could even 
    escape the tourney grounds. Would the Duke give it to him? Would he choose 
    his King over his daughter?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">But then another thought struck me. Perhaps the Duke knew 
    of our plan. Perhaps he had even ordered it. The Duke has greatly distanced 
    himself from Viamontian society these past few months. His behavior has been 
    strange. He has not traveled to the King's castle in months. Is he planning 
    a rebellion?</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">It was the book. In the past years, I have seen many 
    copies of this ancient Roulean text lying about the Duke's fortress. No one 
    speaks of it, but I know everyone has read it. The ideas contained within 
    that book are so dangerous, so intense... I have never been so moved by 
    another's words. It is no wonder the Emperors of Roulea suppressed this work 
    for so long. That book could start a revolution. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Perhaps it already has.</font></p>
