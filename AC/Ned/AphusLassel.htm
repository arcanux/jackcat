<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">As you know, I have a special 
affinity for tuskers. I am a tuskophile. For years, all I've wanted is large 
amounts of tuskers to fight. When I am killing tuskers, I am happy.<br>
<br>
So you can imagine my pleasure when I looked at the notes for the new patch and 
saw that the devs had created a TUSKER ISLAND. Gawd ...a whole island full of 
tuskers? Finally, a patch JUST FOR ME!!! All that sucking up at last Summer's 
ACPL had paid off. I loaded up with deadly arrows and heal potions and snacks. I 
knew this was going to be wonderful and special evening. <br>
<br>
I found the portal to the Tusker Temple; it was near Teth, as you said. I linked 
to it and went through, and began battling tusker guards and tusker worshippers. 
It was fun! A warrior named KIRIKA helped me greatly, guiding me through the 
dungeon to the idol below. I wouldn't have made it without Kirika -- he also 
gave me a tusker shirt and a cool plaque for my house, saying &quot;I survived the 
tusker emporium.&quot;<br>

        </small>
        </span><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But I am getting 
ahead of myself; for one thing, I have not yet survived the tusker emporium, and 
I've fallen prey to doubts that I ever will. That's called foreshadowing!<br>
<br>
I double-clicked on the idol and was WHOOSHED (quick portal) to the &quot;lobby&quot; 
leading to the tusker island. Good thing, because I paused to get a screenshot 
of the idol for you and went down to about 25 health. There were a LOT of 
tuskers there, and the worshippers drop nasty debuffs and vulns.<br>

        </small>
        </span><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It was a painless 
portal jump to the island itself. I strolled around the town, enjoying the 
sights. There were assorted tuskers around, including Bobo the mayor, but 
nothing startling or ominous.<br>
<br>
Then I popped into a dungeon and fought armored tuskers steadily for about 15 
minutes. I think I got about 25 million experience. The humanoid &quot;worshippers&quot; 
kept hitting me with Imperil 6 and Bludgeon Vuln 6 and Vulnerability 5. They 
were incredibly annoying. Various dead players were scattered on the floor 
behind me. But, still, it was not too bad!<br>

        </small>
        </span><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I portaled out when 
things started piling up on me and went through the Temple again to the island. 
I headed West, toward the &quot;other&quot; island. As I approached the Western tip of the 
first island, things began to get bad. Lots of Armored and Silver tuskers. Lots 
of White Wasps. Many worshippers. It was getting hard to stay alive.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2">I reached the water route connecting the first 
island with the second. On the far shore, there was a mixed herd of armored 
tuskers and something else. Some other kind of tusker, dark colored. The herd 
charged toward me, enveloping me. The dark tuskers were Tusker Assailers, level 
350.<br>
<br>
I ran away, healed and regrouped. I went back. I killed a tusker Assailer! 
Imperil 6, Piercing Vuln 6, Arrow, Arrow, Arrow, Arrow, Arrow. Pretty easy! 
Gotta love that imbued Crippling Blow bow.<br>

        </small>
        </span><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then I did another 
Assailer. Resist, resist, resist, resist, resist. Tusker Assailer evaded your 
shot, evaded, evaded, blah, blah, blah. It was very bad. Turns out that you can 
only land spells on it ONCE IN A WHILE, and it often sidesteps arrows without 
any trouble. Sometimes it evades eight or ten arrows in a row. I have a buffed 
bow skill of 360; I am not supposed to be having this sort of non-success.<br>
<br>
Then I caught an Imperil from one of the stinking little Worshippers and -- a 
moment later -- caught a backhanded bashing from an Assailer. Suddenly I had 40 
health. I started running, with white wasps behind me and Armored tuskers behind 
me. And tusker guards, and nasty worshippers and minions and who knows what else 
-- all behind me. <br>

tuskers, as new monsters joined the pack, various types all mixed together, even 
tusker females and males and silvers and more Assailers ...I don't know, really. 
I stopped, and turned; I was at bay like a hunted animal. I gulped a trade heal 
potion and another and another and another and another. The tuskers closed 
around me, cutting me off, making it impossible to run. I was surrounded by a 
sea of tuskers. A giant WALL of tuskers, eight or ten deep! A huge, surging, 
heaving, pushing mosh pit of tuskers. I counted over A HUNDRED tuskers, all 
swinging and smashing at me, trying to hurt me, tear me apart.<br>
<br>
They were frenzied, crazed with hatred for me. It was as though the spirits of 
all the tuskers I had ever killed were concentrated in that mob, tearing at each 
other, wanting only to destroy Ned Cleversun.<br>

recalled to Aerlinth. It was horrible. I hit the landing pad in Aerlinth with 
about 6 health, I'm not sure. I was shaken, distraught and distracted. My nerves 
were shot.<br>
<br>
I had to quit for the night. I need to go to bed. I need to sleep for 12 hours 
or so. I will explore more tomorrow. Maybe.<br>
<br>
I have learned something -- a profound truth. Be careful what you wish for. I 
wanted tuskers. I made jokes about BSD. Well -- I don't think I'll be going to 
BSD any more. I hate to say it, but ...I think I may have become just a little 
afraid of tuskers. Heh. Just kidding.<br>
