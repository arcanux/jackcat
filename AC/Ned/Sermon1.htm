    <font size="2" face="Arial">NED CLEVERSUN'S HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS&nbsp;<br>
    ABOUT HUNTING ETIQUETTE</font>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">* Dropping a vuln spell on a monster does not make it yours. Many players can vuln monsters as easily as they can swing a sword or shoot an arrow. Vulns are cheap and easy and nothing special. If you imagine that a quick spell somehow "marks" the monster as yours, you will spend a lot of time being angry! I have had innumerable monsters shot out from underneath me in the few moments it took for me to switch from the wand to the bow. I had to get used to it!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    * If you are camping a known spawn spot, do not imagine that you are "hunting." Seriously, I have had many misguided players claim to be hunting in areas that have been spawning a particular monster for many weeks. This is especially true if the monster is very desirable or rare. Some players claim that they were "already hunting" a monster and ought to be left in peace. They *were* hunting that monster! And the one before it, and the one after it, and so forth. It is silly to let them get away with that sort of behavior.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    "Hunting" is when you locate a monster in a previously unknown spawn spot or in a temporary spot. I always leave players alone when they are fighting a monster they located while hunting. I don't do that at regular spawn areas, however.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    * When I was a low level player I didn't expect high level (relative to me) players to "share and share alike" or take turns with me. Why should they? The fact is that a high level player needs far more experience points to advance from one level to the next than a lower level player. The higher amount of experience has to come from somewhere.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The game automatically gives high level players fewer points for monsters that are near or below their levels. So high level players only compete with lower level players in limited situations. But -- in those situations -- the high levels are going to take most of what is available, simply because they can. That's how the game works. Someday *you* will be a high level, so kwitcherbichin.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    * The game automatically calculates which player damaged a monster the most and awards the kill entirely to that player. Experience points are apportioned but the loot is not. The player who gets credit for the kill has a window of about 10-20 seconds during which only he or she can access the loot in a monster. After that, anyone can access the loot.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The game *could have* easily made this window of time permanent, or made it 30 seconds, or one minute long. But the devs chose not to do that. You get a short time and that's *all* the time you have to "own" that kill. Players who claim that the loot in a kill is theirs for longer than this window of time are simply trying to invent new rules.<br>
    <br>
    What about courtesy? Well courtesy is good. But there are reasons why the time limit is what it is. In multiple monster situations, for example, a player might need to decide whether to take the time to loot each kill or just keep attacking and making additional kills. More loot or more experience points, which shall it be? The time limit forces a player to make a choice. But some players don't *want* to choose. They want to have it both ways. They want to compete with you for the available monsters AND keep the loot from any kills that they make. They want to change the rules.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    I have had players "horn in" on monsters I have Imperiled, for example, and outpoint me on the monster. Haha -- they didn't have to mess with the wand and switch to the bow, they were able to just shoot or swing the entire time. THEN, after they killed the monster I Imperiled, they died, killed by a second monster. When they got back from the lifestone they were angry if *I* had taken *their* loot. Or they killed a monster that *some other* player had vulned, without bothering to loot the first kill, that I had vulned (after all, you must make hay while the sun shines, right?) and then became angry if "their" loot wasn't untouched when they were ready to gather it up.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Oh, please. These players argue that the game allows them to do this, horn in on monsters vulned by other players, so it must be ok. But these same players claim that the fact the game allows others to take the loot from monsters after 10-20 seconds does NOT make it ok. No, no, no, no.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Do you see the trend here? Some players want to make up special rules that just happen to favor ...them! And they want to declare certain other rules to be not rules at all. They construct elaborate systems of courtesy and permission and become very angry if the special rules they create are not obeyed by other players. This system is called "respect." Its purpose is to hoodwink other players and get more than a fair share for themselves. When you see this happening, laugh and ignore it.&nbsp;<br>
