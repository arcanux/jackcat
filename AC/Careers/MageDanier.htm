      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I get asked a lot of questions about mages,
      stats, skills, comp loads, etc., so decided to write it all down and put
      it out where people can see what I did, what I do, and most importantly,
      why.<br>
      <br>
      I play Danier, a level 62 mage with the following starting stats:<br>
      <br>
      Str:&nbsp; 50<br>
      End:&nbsp; 28<br>
      Coord:&nbsp; 26<br>
      Quick:&nbsp; 26<br>
      Focus:&nbsp; 100<br>
      Self:&nbsp; 100<br>
      Health:&nbsp; 14<br>
      Stamina:&nbsp; 28<br>
      Mana : 100<br>
      <br>
      My starting skills were:&nbsp; War Magic, Life Magic, Item Magic, Creature
      Magic, Mana Conversion. All these were at the Trained level, with the
      following skills added during play:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      Arcane &lt;5&gt;,&nbsp;<br>
      Melee Defense &lt;20&gt;,<br>
      Leadership &lt;35&gt;,&nbsp;<br>
      with Lockpick projected to be added at 65.<br>
      <br>
      What this gives is a character with a lode stone tied to his ass, and a
      big steak dangling from his butt. I was chased down by reedshark after
      reedshark, and devoured quite eagerly. This was before sticky melee, but
      you would never have known it as the monsters would get into a
      &quot;happy&quot; zone right behind me, and simply chew through my very
      low health (Sometimes in one bite) and then have some Danier-dinner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first few levels were tough, for
      obvious reasons. (They didn't have to be, but I was still learning the
      game, and had to pay my price in blood for the lessons.) The lessons I
      learned were as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. Baby Mages have huge firepower compared to fighters of the same level,
      and they are able to use this firepower at range, in relative safety.<br>
      <br>
      2. Baby Mages miss a lot, and scorch a lot of foliage, due either to low
      coord, or low War Magic skills. They need to plan accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      3. Baby Mages simply cannot take damage worth a damn. When the monster
      gets to melee range, you die. This was demonstrated to me very directly
      one night when I was in GW Dungeon &lt;the one there in town&gt; and went
      through EIGHT bodies killing one banderling guard who was right at the
      entrance portal. I would appear, shoot him once, do 10 points of damage
      &lt;maybe, he resisted a lot&gt; and then die. For those that are curious,
      I did kill him and recover, but it hurt.<br>
      <br>
      4. Baby Mages can kill above their level, by a lot.&nbsp; Think about the
      above story of the bodies. I was killing a monster which was double my
      level, something I really had no business fighting, yet I did kill him.
      Baby Mages need to be very careful, but they can kill aurochs, reedsharks,
      lower banderlings, monouga, etc. all with relative safety. They reason I
      mention killing above your level is that it is very important when it is
      time to calculate xp. If you are killing above your level, you get a lot
      more xp than otherwise. The formula, based on speculation, appears to be
      something like:&nbsp; &lt;(monster's health * monster's level) / your
      character's level&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      5. Killing above the level of the mage can continue throughout the life of
      the mage, thus enabling mages to level very quickly. On the downside,
      mages need to recharge etc. Still, mages appear to be able to level more
      quickly than fighters.<br>
      <br>
      6. Baby Mages have no meaningful strength. Even starting with a 50 (high
      for a mage), I did not have sufficient strength to really wear armour. The
      Armour spell and the Impenetrability spell applied to a robe both mostly
      make up for the lack of material armour, at the cost of having to
      continually cast spells. This is annoying, but it is not a bad thing at
      all, as it gets one used to the concepts which will later be absolutely
      necessary in order to manage the magics which will enable success.<br>
      <br>
      Personally, I leveled up on &quot;free-range&quot; monsters for around 7
      levels, then found a nice tower to perch until around 13 when I went up to
      the Neydissa Castle, and used my awesomely powerful level 3 spells to hunt
      the mattekar there, including the now-extinct Hoary Mattekar. The hoary
      was a level 99 monster, and I think I traded bodies around two or three to
      one with it, with me being on the low side of the ratio. For me it was
      worth around 10k xp, and that was &quot;good eatin'&quot;. I also whipped
      on the Great and Snowy Mattekar, burning vitae and growing in power.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, when I created a new mage on a different server &lt;DT&gt; I
      simply found a nice pack of aurochs and liquidated them repeatedly until
      level 6 or so, taking less than 3 hours, then moving to a banderling tower
      near GW, and perching there, then proceeding to mattekar. I used the rules
      above.. and ran a lot. Auroch Yearlings could kill me with one hit, and I
      acted accordingly, by not letting them get to the range needed to
      eviscerate me. (Cowardly, but not gutless was my motto.)<br>
      <br>
      But.. back to stats.. and the reasons for them.<br>
      <br>
      Focus and self are simply critical for mages. There are large areas in
      Asheron's Call where a difference of 10 points in a skill is the
      difference between bouncing when you attack, and hitting a monster well,
      and where 20 points completely turns the tables from being dinner, to
      eating dinner. While it is tempting to slip 10 or 20 points over to
      endurance, you are really better off, especially in the long run, to
      simply deal with the problems at the lowest levels as an investment in
      future power.<br>
      <br>
      Now that you have almost all your points sunk into being a mage, what do
      you do with the rest? You have 90 points to spread between the 4 physical
      stats, so it is evident at a glance that you are going to have to leave
      huge gaping holes in your character, there is simply no way around it.
      That said, the critical issue is where. Remembering that I started my
      character with 50-28-26-26, my suggestion for starting a new one would be
      40-40-10-40, with a possible alternate being 45-45-10-30. This gives you a
      few more health and stamina points, and enables you to buy more at lower
      cost at the higher levels, while somewhat sacrificing your future melee
      abilities. There is the idea of &quot;power mage&quot;, with stats of
      10-100-10-10, but that idea has serious problems with ever having enough
      strength to carry much component, which will become a significant
      restriction at higher levels.<br>
      <br>
      It is a matter of discussion whether or not the loss of offensive melee
      ability is worth the gain in quickness and endurance. I will be the first
      to admit that I DO melee, quite a bit. On the other hand, I do suggest
      taking the hit on melee ability for most people. I never used physical
      weaponry until I was around 45th level, and at that point.. well.. it was
      not really an issue. While it is nice to occasionally use melee on the
      more resistant monsters, it would also be nice to have another 12 stamina.
      (The price for 12 stamina for me right now is roughly the same as 4 points
      of focus / self, a not inconsiderable savings.)<br>
      <br>
      Once created, there is the question of what to spend your hard earned xp
      on.. The answer is a bit of everything, specifically: Mana Conversion,
      Focus, Self, War and Life Magic, Health, Stamina, more Health, Quickness
      (5-10 points), and run (10-15 points). Later, after perhaps 10-15 levels,
      you will have to start buying up Creature and Item magics too. Remember
      that for every 4 points you raise focus /.self, you raise ALL your magics
      by a point, as well as improving mana conversion and magic defense. Note
      that I did not list buying raw mana. That is because it is a fairly low
      priority compared to the others. (though again, after level 20 or so, it
      is nice to dump some points into this and expand it.)<br>
      <br>
      This template of 40-40-10-40 has been used by several people, and seems to
      be satisfactory for most people's play styles and desires. Personally,
      while I hate the loss of endurance, I love having that little bit of extra
      strength for component carrying, but that is because I have a tendency to
      do longer term camping trips than strictly necessary, and a tendency to
      play &quot;lord-protector&quot; to large groups of friends and followers.
      In other words, it matches my play style more closely to have the strength
      instead of the endurance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Skills</b><br>
      <br>
      What skills are really needed to play a mage? To begin, you simply must
      have Life Magic and Mana Conversion. I assume that if you are a
      &quot;mage&quot; you have War Magic, you simply do not have the physical
      attributes for melee. At this point you have 16 skill credits left, and
      what I did was to take Creature and Item magics. There are other options
      of course, here are the common ones about which people inquire:&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      1. You can specialize Mana Conversion. This is a very tempting option now
      that the dev team has shown love to the specializations. The up side is
      that Mana Conversion makes everything you do easier and cheaper, allowing
      you to cast more spells in less time &lt;less need to recharge and to
      prolong your combat time as you tend to not deplete your mana reserves.
      The downside is that the cost is awkward. You now have 2 skill credits
      which you cannot bank, you must spend them during character creation or
      lose them, which usually means you now have Assess Item or something else
      which is really fairly useless. Having effectively spent 8 points on
      specializing Mana Conversion, you are now missing a magic, either Item or
      Creature, which must be purchased at level 9, pushing off the purchase of
      Arcane Lore until 16, and Melee Defense (if desired) until something like
      level 55, a very long time indeed. As much as I would love another 30
      points of Mana Conversion, I do not like this option much. You do have the
      option of course of not taking Item or Creature, but consider that with
      one Creature spell &lt;Mana Conversion Mastery&gt; I can make up the
      difference between non-specialized and specialized, and that there are
      lots of other tasty spells &lt;like Magic Yield Other.. yummy&gt; which
      expand my capabilities vis a vis someone without Creature. Not taking
      Item. well. that IS an option, but it is a poor choice. The opportunity
      cost of Item is simply huge, not to mention the convenience issues. The
      amount of money and treasure which can be gained by killing a mass of
      critters, then looting to a 200% burden and recalling to a store is
      considerable.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">2. You can specialize in Life Magic. This
      takes care of the 2 wasted points you lose if you are specializing in Mana
      Conversion, but the other problems remain. On the plus side, this is a
      much more offensively powerful choice, as your drains are simply going to
      demolish the monsters.. But again.. Life Magic Mastery works just fine.
      Yes, you CAN get that on a wand, orb, or staff, but this has its own
      problems, as you are now restricted to using that particular item, and are
      going to have to spend a great deal of effort in obtaining the higher
      level&nbsp; versions of the items. The real killer of this to me is that
      you lose so much access to the other spells of the Creature school. OR you
      lose access to Melee Defense. Whether or not you really need melee defense
      is a good question, and will be discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      3. You can specialize in War Magic. You are now officially in trouble, as
      you have lost access to both Creature and Item. On the plus side, you get
      to take Arcane at creation with the &quot;change&quot; from the
      specialization. One down side.. well.. losing Item and Creature is a big
      hit, even at low levels. Needless to say, kiss Melee Def. A fond farewell.<br>
      <br>
      4. You can not take Life Magic, and take Healing instead, saving 6 points
      which could be used to specialize Mana Conversion. This IS possible, but
      the loss of access to Life Magic really cripples a mage. Loss of the
      protections and the ability to cast vulnerabilities is serious, but the
      biggest problem I have with this option is the loss of access to the spell
      Stamina to Mana, and related spells. Yes, you can obtain a Life wand / orb
      / staff to enable yourself to cast Stamina to Mana I, but that is a very
      poor substitute.<br>
      <br>
      5. You can drop War Magic, and fight with Life Magic only, saving 16
      points, which could be used to specialize Life and Mana Conversion. This
      is an interesting option, and I am given to&nbsp; understand it worked
      very well in Beta (when lifemagic had a much greater range). The
      disadvantage is that you have lost access to any ranged attack, and you
      have lost access to the awesomely powerful combination of vulnerabilities
      and War spells. While this option woks very well in dungeons, where if it
      is on radar, it is in range, it mandates melee distance as your starting
      range in surface combat, which, at lower levels especially, is rather
      painful. I am personally a big fan of the monster being dead about the
      time it finishes closing the distance to me.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, I recommend the taking of all four Magics, and Conversion, with
      Arcane and Melee Defense by level 20. I find the other options to simply
      be less powerful, as one loses too many of the diverse capabilities which
      magic has to offer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Melee Defense</b><br>
      <br>
      Do mages need melee defense? It is an interesting question, one on which
      there is no real consensus. The problem with a mage's melee defense is
      that due to the dreadfully low starting position, the skill will be very
      difficult to develop. This is worsened by the fact that there appears to
      be a sizable penalty applied to melee defense if the character has a wand
      readied. With these problems, it is really difficult sometimes to see the
      merit of melee defense.<br>
      <br>
      I personally am a fan of buying melee defense, having bought it at level
      20. At the time, I had 135k xp banked, which I slugged directly into the
      skill, bringing it to the dizzyingly high level of 99. I was hunting the
      Mattekar slopes near Neydissa Castle, and was dismayed to find that my
      chances of evading a mattie were approximately diddly divided by squat. I
      felt really ripped, I mean I spent 10 skill credits and a full level's
      worth of xp for something which was not really worth much. Then I survived
      my first &quot;Mite Swarm&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      I quickly reassessed the situation, and have come to the conclusion that
      melee defense is worth buying, not for protection against the monsters you
      are targeting, but for protection from the &quot;environmental&quot;
      monsters. The melee defense will likely not work especially well against
      whatever it is the mage is actually fighting &lt;Though keep in mind, I
      fight well above level. were you to be fighting AT level, that would be
      different.&gt;, but it is wonderful for avoiding whatever else is in the
      area. The number of times when dodging swarms of monsters has saved me is
      considerable, though to be honest, it is also a matter of convenience, and
      of expanded capabilities at higher levels. I like being able to run
      through groups and not care if they swing at me, knowing most of them will
      miss. I also like having the option of readying a shield and weapon, and
      playing melee fighter, which having melee defense helps greatly
      with.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally there is the question of what else
      to spend the points on.. you CAN spend them on specializing something, say
      Mana Conversion, and that would be nifty. You could buy lockpick, or a
      trade skill, or you could simply grab Healing, and learn the Health to
      Mana spells, and save some money on components. My real suggestion is that
      if you are going to forego melee defense, you should decide to do so at
      creation, and spend the points specializing in Conversion or perhaps in
      Life Magic.<br>
      <br>
      For me, I like avoiding the environmental monsters &lt;the big crowds of
      krep that nobody wants to have to kill to get to the creamy monster
      filling of high xp monsters&gt;, and it was well worth it to spend the 10
      skill credits.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Spool-up</b><br>
      <br>
      Spool-up refers to the series of spells a mage casts before entering
      combat, hostile situations, researching, or (it seems sometimes) flushing
      the toilet, eating a Holtburger, or scratching one's own nose.<br>
      <br>
      Spooling is rather simple at lower levels, the mage tosses armour self,
      impen on the robe, maybe a few specific spells like sprint if they are
      going to be traveling, war magic mastery if they feel the need, mana
      recovery and stamina recovery spells, etc. Generally this will be a brief
      series, using 50% to 100% of the mana pool, which then needs to be
      recovered. The limitation on how many spells get cast is basically
      constrained by the short duration of the spells themselves, and the slow
      rate of mana recovery.<br>
      <br>
      At higher levels, the listing of spells used grows dramatically. Stamina
      and Mana recovery spells get used a LOT more, or items which mimic their
      effects do. The mage's stamina pool expands and their ability to convert
      that to mana grows sufficiently that it is possible to cast more than 100%
      of the mana pool as prep spells if desired, though duration is still a
      real issue until level 5 spells are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      At the highest levels (34+) spooling becomes an art form, and very quickly
      effects a stratification between the good mages and outstanding mages. For
      an example of a totally silly spooling pattern, here is what I used at
      level 34 to fight olthoi. It is an example of a very deep and annoyingly
      long spooling process which I&nbsp; used to fight far above my level. In
      order, I would cast:<br>
      <br>
      Creature Magic Mastery 4<br>
      Creature Magic Mastery 5<br>
      Mana Conversion Mastery 5<br>
      Willpower 5<br>
      Focus 5<br>
      Creature Magic Mastery 6<br>
      Life Magic Mastery 6<br>
      Rejuvenation 6<br>
      Mana Recovery 6<br>
      Mana Conversion Mastery 6<br>
      Item Enchantment Mastery 6<br>
      War Magic Mastery 6<br>
      Armour 6<br>
      Piercing Protection 6<br>
      Acid Protection 6<br>
      Impen 6 &lt;robe&gt;<br>
      Impen 6 &lt;gloves&gt;<br>
      Acid Bane 6 &lt;both&gt;<br>
      Piercing Bane 6 &lt;both&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Not listed are all the revitalization - stamina to mana spell cycles,
      though at that time I was usually either resting or accepting the generous
      contributions of drained olthoi stamina if such was available. Once it was
      all up, the sequence was shortened by removing all the level 5 spells.
      There are a lot of things about this which should be noted:&nbsp; I am a
      very, very patient person, and was willing to put up with such a spooling
      pattern as it enabled me to fight far above my level, and to obtain some
      treasures which were simply not available in any other areas. Casting all
      these spells gave me the exact defenses at level 34 which I continue to
      employ at level 62, so that ability of the olthoi to affect me was almost
      precisely the same as it is right now, and I can assure that Danier tanks
      olthoi quite well, then and now. My character's ability to affect the
      olthoi in return has, of course, improved dramatically.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, my current spool up cycle is much shorter, starting with
      Creature 5, then Mana Conversion, then continuing with whatever is needed
      (usually focus and self next).<br>
      <br>
      At this point, I would expect that at least 3/4ths of the people reading
      this are asking the simple question &quot;Do I have to do all that
      crap?&quot;. The short answer is yes and no. Of course you do not, but it
      is like getting the right items for a fighter. Do you NEED bludgeoning and
      slashing protection to fight in the Citadel? Or do you need acid and
      piercing protections to fight olthoi? The answer is no, you do not, but
      without them you are really going to be a hurting puppy, and by the time
      you really do not need them, you are above the level of the monster, and
      are not getting much xp for killing them, as they do not present that
      great a threat to you.<br>
      <br>
      It is not necessary to have such an amazingly long spool up of course, the
      example given is pretty extreme.&nbsp; On the other hand, it provides for
      the absolute best protection available in the game against the monsters it
      istargeted against, and allows killing of monsters at twice the
      character's&nbsp; level. (Anyone trying to fight olthoi at level 34 mage
      is well advised to drain though.. their resistance is fairly ugly, and you
      will need the health gained through draining to survive most likely.)<br>
      <br>
      I should write a big conclusion to all of this, but to be honest I simply
      cannot muster the prurient interest. The key with it all is to have fun.
      It is like roleplaying. If you really like playing the blind one-eyed lame
      dwarf what only comes out after sunset to terrorize the residents of
      villages, then by all means do it. Just because I suggest something as
      optimal neither means I am right nor does it mean that anyone has to
      agree.<br>
      <br>
      There are good, solid reasons for the choices I suggest, and I have tried
      to detail them whenever possible. If there are any questions, please feel
      free to email me and ask, I would be more than happy to expand this&nbsp;
      document as needed to cover different areas. It is my hope that this helps
