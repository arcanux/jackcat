    Recently, I got mail from Archer From Hell, inviting me to his and the
    lovely Savona's wedding. My first AC wedding! I could hardly wait! Finally,
    the happy day arrived. I scooted on over to Frostfell and waited in
    Cragstone for Archer to portal my newbie self up to beautiful Neydisa
    Castle.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">When I arrived, the courtyard
    was full of brightly dressed guests, milling about. I looked down at my
    tunic and pants, feeling very underdressed. But Archer &amp; Savona had
    thought of everything! Before I knew it, I was clad in a gorgeous yellow
    gown, courtesy of Ny'a.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Uninvited Guest</b><br>
    Archer &amp; Savona were both dressed in white Mattekar Robes for the
    occasion. I caught a picture of them standing together, holding hands,
    before the ceremony. They looked very happy! More and more guests arrived as
    the hour approached. Soon, the only person still left to arrive was the
    priest. We waited. And waited. And we waited. Finally, we heard someone
    approaching. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. But wait!! That wasn't
    Father O'Malley!&nbsp;</font></p>

    </b>By this time, the bride was looking a little less happy. Father O'Malley
    had still not arrived. The guests were getting restless. Someone broke out
    the refreshments. Then someone broke out the wine. Then the stout, then the
    ale, and the beer, then the cake, whole chickens, even steaks! Then more
    wine. The guests were all getting DRUNK! A mage climbed up on the roof and
    started shooting spells at people in the courtyard. Soon, there were
    fireworks everywhere! There was dancing and casting and merriment. And more
    chickens and wine and more fireworks. What a cool reception.

    </b>It was so crazy that day I didn't really have much of a chance to talk
    to either Archer From Hell or Savona. I met up with the newlyweds another
    night so they could fill me in on how things were going. I asked them how
    they met. Archer From Hell said that he ran across Savona's previous
    character, Sho June, while he was killing Banders outside Yashi in November
    1999. He was fleeing from some Skeletons at the time. &quot;You need a
    patron?&quot; he asked. He was level 8; she was level 5.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;</font></p>

</font>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Was it romance ever since?
    &quot;No,&quot; Savona replied. She turned down his generous offer at the
    time. A few days later, however, she ended up pledging to him. It was a long
    and rocky road to the wedding. Archer From Hell was thinking he just might
    like to ask Sho June out. Then his friend Soney asked him if he would see if
    Sho June would go out with him. Soney and Sho June were married in-game not
    long after. Sadly, it seems as if Soney had a problem with commitment. Sho
    June rarely saw him after the &quot;wedding&quot;.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hacked</b><br>
    Sho June was eventually retired and Savona pledged to Archer From Hell. She
    kept to herself a lot. Then Archer From Hell got hacked and his account was
    hi-jacked! Someone had gotten access to his hotmail account, had his account
    password emailed, then changed his password and released all his vassals.
    Archer canceled the credit card immediately, but he was so soured by the
    incident he wasn't sure he ever wanted to play again. For four months Archer
    From Hell was a defunct character. Eventually, with the help of the hotmail
    folks, he gained control of his email account again, and had the account
    password emailed again. Archer From Hell was back! Still at level 43, four
    months later, but back, nonetheless!</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Loyal and True<br>
    </b>Savona had never pledged to a new patron. Since she had been one of his
    first vassals, she knew he would never have released her and guessed that
    something was wrong. Savona remained a mini-monarch with 9 vassals, loyal
    and true to Archer From Hell, until he returned. She re-pledged and over
    time, their feelings for each other grew. (To wrap up the loose ends, Soney
    has since quit AC ;)</font></p>

</b>Archer From Hell had re-pledged to his old monarch after returning. When the
monarch quit the game, he released Archer. Arched pledged under another member
of the monarchy. Things were fine for a while, but then the new monarch stopped
playing much. He stopped answering @tells from followers. Then one day, when
Savona asked for help oiling a string, he was rude to her!&nbsp; That's the day
Archer From Hell became a monarch himself, vowing never to insult or ignore his
followers. His approach seems to be working. Currently he has 117 followers,
over 90 of them players, with very few mules in the tree! They love going on
quests and hunting and make their home at scenic Neydisa Castle.</font></p>
