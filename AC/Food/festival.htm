    <br>
    Cooks of Dereth have been hard at work and have added a collection of 
    delicious new recipes to their cookbooks for the Festival Season.<br>
    <br>
    Many of these recipes will become year-round favorites while some are 
    centered on the festivities of the season.<br>
    <br>
    NEW INGREDIENTS<br>
    <br>
    Recently three new ingredients have been found in Dereth and its neighboring 
    islands.<br>
    <br>
    Peppermint: Cooks have started using this new ingredient in their recipes 
    since its appearance on Drudges and Mosswarts this winter. Many scholars 
    believe that the mischievous creatures used some magical means to steal the 
    Peppermint from the strange Candy Sticks that appeared in towns recently.<br>
    <br>
    Nutmeg: The aromatic kernel of a small fruit, Nutmeg is found in the jungles 
    of the Vesayen Isles in the Southeast. When ground, it adds a lovely flavor 
    to certain dishes.<br>
    <br>
    Ginger: Ginger, a root found in the South, is a powerful spice when ground 
    and used in cooking. Cooks have already found they can use it to make Ginger 
    Bread, and an industrious Tinsmith named Woz, has created cookie cutters 
    that allow people to make Ginger Bread Cookies in interesting shapes. 
    Distant provisioners have reported buying his wares.<br>
    <br>
    SANDWICHES<br>
    <br>
    A simple, but tasty meal for the busy adventurer or studious mind short on 
    time.<br>
    <br>
    Use the Carving Knife to cut some Bread into Sliced Bread that can be used 
    with the following foods to make Sandwiches: <br>
    <br>
    with Cheese: Cheese Sandwich<br>
    with Chicken: Chicken Sandwich<br>
    with Egg: Egg Sandwich<br>
    with Fish: Fish Sandwich<br>
    <br>
    Also for a change of pace you can use the Frying Pan on a Cheese Sandwich to 
    make a nice hot Grilled Cheese Sandwich.<br>
    <br>
    DINNER FOODS<br>
    <br>
    Cragstone Farms is well known for their skillful cooking and catering. Now 
    they bring us two new casserole recipes for the Festival Season, Cragstone 
    Farms Mac&amp;Cheese and Cragstonanoff.<br>
    <br>
    Using raw noodles on cheese makes Cragstone Farms Mac&amp;Cheese. Some unknown 
    interaction between the noodles and cheese magically heats this delicious 
    casserole*. <br>
    <br>
    *Alchemists are studying this culinary calefaction, but it currently remains 
    a mystery peculiar to this world.<br>
    <br>
    Cragstonanoff is a wonderfully hearty meal with a rich new noodle 
    ingredient.<br>
    <br>
    You start by making some Batter, Dough+Egg. Using your Noodle Cutter cut out 
    Raw Egg Noodles from the Batter and then use the Raw Egg Noodles on Ground 
    Meat. After the magic heating stage you have a meal fit for Queen Elysa!<br>
    <br>
    A little taste of Ispar; two dumpling recipes have been created. These 
    simple foods evoke wonderful memories of our homeland and the things we left 
    behind.<br>
    <br>
    Dumplings are made with Rice Dough. Rice Dough is made by using a 
    Mortar&amp;Pestle on Uncooked Rice and then using the resulting Rice Flour on 
    Water. Once you have your Rice Dough you wrap it around either Chicken or 
    Fish to make Chicken Dumplings or Fish Dumplings just like mother used to 
    make.<br>
    <br>
    WINTER DRINKS<br>
    <br>
    For those who like nice hot drinks for the cold winter months, but don't 
    like the agitation that coffee or tea can cause we have a sweet new drink to 
    warm you up.<br>
    <br>
    Hot Chocolate: Heat some milk with your cooking pot. Take the Hot Milk and 
    use it with Honey to get Sweetened Hot Milk. Cocoa Powder is then used on 
    the Sweetened Hot Milk to make a rich cup of Hot Chocolate.<br>
    <br>
    Peppermint Hot Chocolate: Using Peppermint on Hot Chocolate adds a minty 
    twist to this already delicious drink.<br>
    <br>
    Definitely a seasonal favorite, Eggnog is a rich and spicy drink that can 
    now be properly made due to the discovery of Nutmeg on the far Southern 
    Vesayen Isles. Nutmeg is a spice of extreme use to cooks who we hope will 
    continue to find new ways in which to use it.<br>
    <br>
    First you need to grind your nutmeg into a useful form for cooking. Use the 
    Heavy Grinder on the Nutmeg to make Ground Nutmeg. Use the Ground Nutmeg on 
    Milk to make Spiced Milk and then use the Spiced Milk on an Egg to create 
    the rich Festival Season treat of Eggnog.<br>
    <br>
    SNACKS<br>
    <br>
    Many people have Festival Parties in the winter months, especially now that 
    they may have homes to invite their friends to. A new snack that can be 
    served to your guests has been cooked up. Warning: Stuffed Mushrooms take 
    time and patience to cook.<br>
    <br>
    First use your Carving Knife on a mushroom to remove its stem. Use the 
    Stemless Mushroom on some Cheese to stuff it. Use your Baking Pan on the 
    Cheese Filled Mushroom to cook a mouth watering Stuffed Mushroom, perfect 
    for your Festival get-togethers.<br>
    <br>
    TREATS<br>
    <br>
    Peppermint makes candy better. Minty goodness is making its way into all 
    sorts of sweets.<br>
    <br>
    Using a Peppermint Stick on a Milk Chocolate Bar makes a Peppermint 
    Chocolate Bar with crushed peppermint in it, a very sweet recipe.<br>
    <br>
    For those who enjoy Monougat... there's some long lasting chewy fun now. If 
    you add Peppermint to Monougat you will make a Peppermint Monougat Chew.<br>
    <br>
    DESSERTS<br>
    <br>
    Peppermint in cookies? Of course!<br>
    Use Peppermint on Cookie Dough.<br>
    Use your Baking Pan on the resulting dough to bake three Peppermint Cookies.<br>
    <br>
    Chocolate lovers rejoice!<br>
    Use Cocoa Powder on Cookie Dough to make Chocolate Cookie Dough. Use your 
    Baking Pan on the resulting dough to make three Chocolate Cookies.<br>
    <br>
    Use Peppermint on Chocolate Cookie Dough. Use your Baking Pan on the 
    resulting dough to make a batch of three Peppermint Chocolate Cookies. Mmmm!<br>
    <br>
    Cooks are working hard at coming up with new flavors of Ice Cream. <br>
    &quot;So far we only have four flavors, which isn't quite enough for an Ice Cream 
    Shop,&quot;<span lang="en-us"> </span>says Benjury Cookson, the leading 
    researcher in Ice Cream recipes.<br>
    &quot;There have been some unfortunate flavors during my research. Cooking 
    research can be very dangerous here on Dereth if you don't know what your 
    doing. Its not as easy or safe as you might think.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Use a Peppermint Stick on Ice Cream to make Peppermint Ice Cream. Seems 
    pretty easy.<br>
    <br>
    Ginger is a spicy... spice you can use to... flavor up your cooking recipes. 
    Some new recipes were made last month.<br>
    <br>
    To use Ginger in cooking you first need to grind it. Use the Heavy Grinder 
    on your Ginger to make Ground Ginger.<br>
    <br>
    Use Ground Ginger on Dough to make Ginger Bread Dough. Use a Baking Pan on 
    the dough to make Ginger Bread.<br>
    <br>
    Or use a Cookie Cutter on the dough and then use your Baking Pan on the 
    result to make a Ginger Bread Creature.<br>
    <br>
