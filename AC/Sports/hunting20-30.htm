      them. (Occasionally a High Priest will run up from below but he will NEVER
      come down the hall unless you hit him.&nbsp; Just let him run away).&nbsp;
      Go loot the 3 corpses.&nbsp; Repeat until you are out of ammo.&nbsp; LS
      recall to sell all the loot you've picked up (average 10K for me).&nbsp;
      Portal recall in and repeat the whole thing. What screws it up -- other

      lead them up into your carefully executed dance.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Jerem

      <br>
      Nice easily accessible alternative to the DOC. It is a decent run from
      Qalaba'r. The N/E/W halls lead to the Virindi quest scrolls, but contain a
      decent number of drudges to kill. Head in further to find dolls. Virindi
      lurk at the ends. The south hall leads to more drudges, hollow minions,
      and some tuskers. On some servers it can be camped. Use life protects and
      War magic. Some folks drain from the big platform in the beginning.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">One

      entrance summoned when North/South Black Claw Raider is killed.&nbsp; This
      is the dungeon the Quiddity Orb comes from.&nbsp; Characters level 20-35
      can enter, but characters below level 25 are not likely to be able to solo
      a group of Drudge Lurkers.&nbsp; The entrance can be recalled, but neither
      tied nor summoned)<br>
      <br>
      Best suited for characters with life magic specialized, able to portal
      recall, and never portal tied. The linear nature of the dungeons makes it
      easy to find corpses when necessary, and it doesn't take long to learn
      where the Drudge spawn.&nbsp; It's easy to control the number of Drudge
      you're exposed to at any one time, but the spawn rate is fast enough that
      several characters could share the dungeon and still be killing
      constantly.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the extensive use of war magic by the Drudge, it's best to wear a
      full set of life protects. Probably one of the easiest places to learn to
      handle magic-using monsters. Due to the difficulty of accessing the
      dungeon and the fact that a full set of life prots is required, this
      dungeon is almost never camped.&nbsp; Great for the confident hunter of
      the appropriate level.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ygraine

      do have to kill a Black Claw Raider to get in, though :) Lurkers are in
      the beginning, then Stalkers, then Raveners. Use Life protects, especially
      blade, bludgeon, pierce, acid, and lightning. Lightning is only if you
      plan on fighting Raveners. Xp is very nice at that level and once a week
      you can get an orb half.</font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One

      Bring a fire or slashing weapon and some protections as drudges cast level
      3/4 critter debuffs and level 3/4 war spells.&nbsp; The environment can
      also be used to limit the number of drudges faced at any one time -
      usually 1 to 3, sometimes 4.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Altais

      <br>
      Excellent for Mages and Archers. I took my main character (Life spec) to
      Teth at 16, although you tend to focus on draining the Wasps at that lvl.
      There are towers/walls for perching archers and war mages, or you can
      drain from behind the walls. There is a nearby lifestone, a Master
      Archmage, Bowyer, Provisioner, Armourer, Leather Crafter and Tumerok
      Collector, and a Hilltop portal to get you to Glenden Wood easily. As you
      approach 30 you can begin to venture outside and tank things like Drudges
      and Golems for even better XP. Melees should wait until the 30's for Teth,
      unless they can be powerlevelled by a High-lvl friend.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Brux

      Level 20 Dagger<br>

      Bring Fire Weapons. Usually empty although you can find a group doing the
      Obsidian Dagger quest once in a while (which is a bonus). Advantage to
      hunting in the Cloister versus Metos is that you have a greater chance of
      having the place to yourself.<br>
      <br>
      Warning: Risens have very high armor value, so it takes a while to kill
      them. A team of an Archer (to kill) and a Melee (to absorb damage) works
      best here.<br>
      <br>
      Mara the Mage of FF<br>
      <br>
      Easy run from Yaraq or the arenas. Level 30 restriction on the entry
      portal. This is the quest dungeon for the Obsidian Dagger/Barbed Fletching
      Tool. Aside from the quest, it is excellent for mages (anyone who can
      drain, warspells nice but not vital - creature also VERY helpful). Many
      good drain spots in the hallways. Quite a bit of low-weight, high-value
      loot (jewelry and gems), plus Small Mnemosynes.<br>
      <br>
      Not great for melee unless you: A) have high magic resistance and/or B)
      have a mage friend backing you.<br>
      <br>
      Side note - none of the cloister portals can be summoned (just recalled).
      If you are playing magical taxi for folks, summon to Yaraq or the nearby
      PK arena.<br>

      Great place if you don't want to move much to powerleveling. Low level
      people will stay on 1st and 2nd floor with Obeloths and Lithos. For level
      30+ go to the 3rd floor an try the Extas (8K xp per kill), and if you want
      some more experience, take the book in Linvak for the Lugian quest and you
      could fight some Tiatus Raiders and the Commander.<br>
      <br>
      Less xp than BSD but far safer :)<br>

      first spawn point for the Linvak Tukal quest is a great place to level
      from probably 26+. I can't remember exact coordinates, but it is SE of
      Linvak Tukal, and is a large island-shaped rock full of Lugians from
      Obeloth up through Gigas. Almost EXACTLY like Citadel hunting, but the
      times I have gone, I have been the only one there!<br>
      <br>
      Don't kill the Master of the Hunt unless YOU are on the quest, or you are
      bound to make a lot of people angry! It spawns only once per hour when you
      kill the Commander, and if you kill it, the group actually doing the quest
      may be angry.&nbsp;&nbsp; =(<br>
