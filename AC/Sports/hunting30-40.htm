      <br>
      This is a great place to hunt. Just make sure you bring a fire
      weapon/arrows! On the first level there are Drudge Raveners/Stalkers in
      each of the 3 rooms down the hallway. If you attack one, they all come at
      you. The lower level contains Virindi Servants/Masters, Tusker Guards, and
      more Drudges. Make sure you don't rush into a room without inspecting it
      first because it is easy to be overcome by a lot of monsters. I wish you

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> Ok the dungeon is small and offers good loot averaging
      2K. The Raveners drop SIK's and Guts now and again. Standing rules in the dungeon are these:
      1) Keep the critters out of the entrance/buff room. 2) If you can't kill the Minions, leave them alone please. Tumideon Minions are the meanest of
      theire kind and inflict lots of damage. Regulars in the dungeon such as myself (been there since level 30) really find it difficult to play the dungeon when these
      Minions are loose and roaming the place. This is also a good place to Tie to if
      you're level 50+ and like to hunt the Obsidian Plains as it rests in the heart of this ever increasing place of danger. I suggest that your toon be able to cast level 6+ protection and cast level 5 Vulns and War spells as you will come up against as many as Five to eight Drudge Raveners and Stalkers
      at one time. Tuskers are maxed to 2 at one time, but you may find your self getting
      pummeled by three at a time on rare occasions.&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hunt the Liches (use Fire)
      until about 30 or so.&nbsp; Then jump across the Acid Pit for some Irons
      (use Acid). When your attack skill (UA, sword, etc.) is buffable to 250
      (level 32 in my case), go get the Revenants. They are 10K a pop but all
      life protects are needed.&nbsp; Archers won't have as much of a problem
      killing the Revs as melees, so they may be able to take a Rev a little
      earlier.&nbsp; If you're not sure if you can take a Rev and you don't want
      to risk dying, try taking the one in the subway. Obsidians can be VERY
      dangerous.&nbsp; About a week ago I got hit for 140+ on a single melee
      attack with level 4 protects and 180+ armor, so be careful.&nbsp;</font></p>

      BH (Black Hills) Metos: You'll need someone to cast the portal for you, but just tie to it and the xp is great.
      Liches and Lich Lords are ok for 25+, but I prefer the Iron Golem rooms just a bit ahead. Good for
      melees and missile. Acid of course. Just a cool place for mote and iron heart hunting. Loot is usually rings and magic jewels, so just have a lot of
      pack space available.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">        Soteh the Just

      I think the Obsidian Plains one is nice. The only problem is you need a
      decent jump skill to cross the acid safely. (P.S. If you fall into the
      acid pit, run at the wall. There is a secret door.) Once you can make the
      jump, hunt Irons (VERY weak to acid, drop motes and level 2-3 jewelry).
      Then for higher levels you can try the Revs and Obsidian. Beware that
      there can be as many as 6-7 Revs in the first room, so you may need help.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Leman

      Level 27 UA/Item<br>
      <br>
      At level 33, I found that killing level 90 Revenants gives me 10,000 xp
      each.&nbsp; And the loot is awesome!!&nbsp; Bring your fire weapons, as
      undead are weak against fire (and bludgeon).&nbsp; Mages can drain here,
      but it's slow and hard to cast drains on a&nbsp; level 90 magic user. Buff
      against everything, as Revenants cast all types of magic against you.&nbsp;
      I currently kill one at a time, heal, then lure another one, kill,
      heal...repeat. This is with ALL level 4 life protects (acid, bludgeon,
      blade, fire, etc), and a Fire sword that does 15-30 dmg buffed, and a
      buffed sword skill of about 265(?). If you have Item magic, you can load
      up on goods (hauberks, peas, magic armor/weapons, the works) and just
      recall to a town and sell. Revenants also drop&nbsp; SIKs, though I've yet
      to get one from them.&nbsp; They also drop Large Mnemosynes, worth 15k in
      xp, or 45k in xp if you use an Obsidian Key on them.&nbsp;It's EASY to
      make 40k in about 20 minutes if you kill 4 or 5 Revenants here. A normal
      spawn produces 5 or 6 Revenants, but you don't have to face more than 2 at
      a time, tops... if you lure them.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Satyricon

      I brought my LC mage here at level 4 with the trick of tying to a portal 
      that surfaces you to an earlier part of the dungeon, but without the 25+ 
      level restriction. The Lurkers and Stalkers in the front are great xp for 
      her! Most people don't know about the second part, the envoy. It contains 
      about 50 Raveners! This you can't enter until level 25. If you explore the 
      envoy, you will find rooms with Hollows, Tuskers, and Virindi. More 
      drudges too. If you keep to the right of the envoy upon entering, you will 
      find yourself face to face with a character Virindi! He doesn't drop a 
      spell; he drops a unique obsidian shard. Really worth a visit if you are a 
      lore freak. If you are a more observant follower of directions, you may 
      find yourself taking a right up a ramp, and onto a ledge. Two tuskers

      The only ones here are those doing the quests, and they never stop en 
      route. Take all the loot and exp. Uber money and levels. :-)) Very rarely 
      heard of leveling spot with no competition that I have ever seen. </font>

      Gigas and Extas Lugians - ALL USING HOLLOW WEAPONS<br>
      <br>
      HIGH ORE Recommended level with group 35 + || Solo 40+. There are some 
      traps on the way down to the actual mine. To avoid them stay on a wall 
      when crossing into another room. <br>
      <br>
      Once you get into the mine there are (with few exceptions) only Extas 
      Lugians. They will either throw rocks (Bludg), go straight HtH (Bludg) or 
      use axes (Slash).<br>
      <br>
      Just follow corridors until you reach an ore deposit. Use it as cover when 
      the Lug's throw and then take them in HtH. There is a reasonable spawn 
      rate. I averaged 14 per 15 min buff and they are worth about 9K XP each.<br>
      <br>
      Loot is weak but decent SIK drop rate on the Extas. Remember that you will 
      only need Blade (Slash) and Bludgeoning protections. Hollow will bypass 
      banes. <br>
