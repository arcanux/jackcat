      <br>
      I've tried hunting at the Lugian Citadel, and pretty much anywhere
      else.&nbsp; The easiest and quickest experience I've gotten is off of
      anything already dead. :) Zombies and Undead are great experience... about
      950 for zombies, and undead aren't that far off.&nbsp; They don't heal,
      they can't dodge, and while they do cast spells quite frequently, they're
      still easy to handle.&nbsp; I can kill a Zombie in about 10 seconds, and
      in areas like the GW Prison and Halls of Helm, you can go through an
      almost endless horde of Zombies.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if someone else is
      around you'll find the Zombies just don't respawn fast enough to keep you
      leveling steadily. Great for the un-tweaked characters... extremely easy
      for low-levels with GSA and Atlan Weapons.</font>

      Comments: Good for Archers and Mages. There is a lifestone right next to
      the tower. Mage inside sells minimal goods. Closest town is Uziz and it is
      a long run, but the tower is usually empty so you get all the kills. Spawn
      rate is set so you can clear 5 spawns from the tower and still have time
      to loot. Bring lots of comps or arrows if you don't have ls recall and a
      town portal tied. Hardest part is getting there to use the ls. Bring a
      higher level friend to help clear the way.<br>

      From Arwic, run east/northeast to the beach.&nbsp; Run north once you hit
      the beach.&nbsp; You will eventually come to some standing stones near the
      beach with Shallows Slayers around them.&nbsp; Keep heading north to about
      42N, 63W.&nbsp; You should see some stones in the water close to this
      location.&nbsp; This is where the Shore Dillos should spawn.<br>
      <br>
      Be careful not to let them get behind you and wear blade protection if you
      have it.&nbsp; If possible, take some throwing weapons along to lure them
      out one at a time, as they are not sociable critters and don't help each
      other out.<br>
      <br>
      If I remember correctly, they give about 1.2K XP per dillo.&nbsp; That is
      not bad for a level 10-12 character.<br>
      <br>
      I usually hunt these until I can head to citadel at level 15-17.&nbsp; It
      is quite a run, so keep in mind that you will want to stock up on healing
      kits etc. if you don't want to run back to town often to restock. It works
      great to have a buddy of higher level drop off supplies for you if
      possible.<br>

      <br>
      Hi, this is a suggestion for people who don't have the option of someone
      power leveling them. The best place I have found to level from 8ish to
      15ish is a small dungeon of the coast of Tou Tou called Smugler's Cove.<br>
      <br>
      The place is filled with Banderlings of many levles. They are spaced out
      enough to where it usually isn't a problem for a low level character
      because you can fight them one-at-a-time. After you make your way to the
      bottom, you'll enter the last room. You will have a chest in front of you,
      a surface portal to the left, and to the right if you run all the way, in
      the corner is a hidden room. Go down the passageway and a Banderling
      Captain waits for you, plus 2 chests with noob sell items in them.<br>

      There are 8-10 Sandstone Golems spread throughout and 2 Granite Golems
      that hang out in a back room. One of the main rooms has a Revitalize

      The experience is very good, unless the dungeon is heavily hunted.&nbsp;
      Much, much better than the 'standard' recommendation of the mountains or

      Both Forbidden Crypts and A Mysterious Cave are GREAT for leveling from
      level 8-20. I recommend the Forbidden Crypts for leveling though, and
      Mysterious Cave for getting motes for the newbies out there who can't go to
      Metos quite yet. In Forbidden Crypts Zombies give 1,000 xp, Undead 500xp, and the
      Lich 2,000xp!<br>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Great xp and if you can cast level 3 or 4
  protects you do ok. Starting at level 15 Iron Golems and Liches will wield a
  lot of xp with
      low to medium risk. Watch out for the Irons at lower level's for when they
      crit, they crit hard and usually send you to the lifestone if your health is under
  100.&nbsp;Once you can cast level 5 buffs, you should be hunting the Revs.&nbsp;They
  give 10k xp each and the spawn is perfectly timed for a solo player (well
      at least for me, but I'm comfortable in my fighting style against them).&nbsp;
      I was able to start hunting them at a lower level because my starting stats were much
  like a mage's except for the coord.&nbsp; You may be hitting them later on
      in level's if you're not casting 5's by level 25.&nbsp; But I would not try them without
  level 5 protects; they like to throw level 5 and 6 war spells on top of a lot of drains.<br>

      The Liches are easy for the people around level 17-21. Irons are better
      for 21+ and same with the Granites. Revenants are good for about 27+. I
      don't really know a good level for the Obsidian Golems; I have never
      hunted them. :)<br>

      I've been hunting at Metos since I was level 23 and I love it.&nbsp; When
  you're high tens/low twentys. you can fight Liches. Then when you get better
      you can move up to Iron Golems. Then when you hit 35 or so you can move up
      again to the Revs.&nbsp; It's also a great place to get motes for Atlans.
  Since I've been there, I have found enough for 3, almost 4 Atlans, and I find
      more every day.&nbsp; You also get good di's off Iorns, and the Revs just
      drop great loot all around.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">

      Archer and war mage dream dungeon. Also some decent drain spots for
      life mages. Everything here can be hunted well with ranged spells or arrows.
      Quite a few long hallways allow ranged hunting. Lots of stamina fountains scattered about.<br>
      <br>
      Golems drop gems and spell components (and a very occasional mote). Mu-miyahs drop magical jewelry and an occasional tiny
      mnemosyne. Wasps drop wings (duh). In other words, great loot for folks with low strength.<br>

      go to the 2nd highest flight of stairs.&nbsp; Don't go out on the ledge or stay too
      close to the door unless you like flying rocks.&nbsp; Black Rats spawn above and
      sometimes fall onto the steps with you.&nbsp; Don't kill the Black Rats to
      avoid this annoyance.&nbsp; Take lots of comps as you may find it tough getting
      in and out of the tower.&nbsp; By level 20 the Lugians will only yield 40K xp per
