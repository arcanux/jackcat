      (near Hebian-To lifestone and Cragstone portal)&nbsp;<br>
      Recommended Levels: 1-5<br>
      <br>
      Creatures: low level Drudges, Shreths, Wasps, Mosswarts, Reedsharks.&nbsp;
      If you venture a little further, you can find higher level varieties of
      each creature, as<br>
      well as Dolls, Banderlings, etc.<br>
      <br>
      This is a great area for low-level hunting.&nbsp; You can often find
      groups of low-level players to hunt with and help with corpse
      recovery.&nbsp; Often mid-level characters are willing to help with corpse
      recovery if needed at this location.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Yakob

      <br>
      Run North from the West Lytlethorpe Outpost (1.0N, 48.4E) to the Ruined
      Cave (2.3N, 48.3E). Then turn left (West) to the temple. Once you run up
      the steps, you can attack the creatures with impunity. As long as you stay
      away from the edge, only missile or magic can hit you. There is even a
      pillar to dodge behind to avoid these attacks!<br>

      Lifestone at 3.9N, 70.5E</b><br>
      Recommended Levels: From 1 (if you're careful) to 12<br>
      <br>
      Creatures: Plenty of sloooowww Aurochs, and fast-fast-fast Reedsharks,
      Hunter Shreths and 'dillos. Plus, the beach is about 3 clicks away to the
      east. The general<br>
      population there being Azure Gromnies, Mud and Water Golems, with an
      occasional Broken Fragment and Shadow Child.<br>
      <br>
      It's a terrific leveling spot, particularly for archers (or at least folks
      with Bow trained). Quick spawn times, and flat terrain with decent escape
      routes for shoot-and-scoot.<br>
      <br>
      Be careful, though. It's a treacherous run for characters below level 5,
      but doable from, say, Lytelthorpe (I was able to get a level 1 UA/Archer
      there with 5 Health...on the THIRD TRY!)<br>
      <br>
      Also, the bowyer (who buys weapons only) sells Armor Piercing, Frog

      Creatures: Auroch Cows -- Level 10, very slow with 80 health.<br>
      <br>
      Cows are very slow, so they are perfect for archers and mages.&nbsp;
      Because<br>
      they hit hard, warriors will want at least 25 health and some decent armor<br>
      before trying these.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Darken-Rahl'

      When running to the area from Yaraq, learn where the spawn points are so
      you can avoid them as the spawns are level 25+. Start near the middle and

      Creatures: Mosswarts, Drudges, couple of Brown Armoredillos, Azure
      Gronmies, Outcast Monouga, Banderlings, and Wasps spawn close outside the
      walls.<br>
      <br>
      This is a great place to hunt in early levels. I normally come here at
      level 1-3 and stay here till level 10 or so. There is a LS next to a tower
      (viewable from the fort) NW of the fort, along with an Archmage inside.<br>
      <br>
      Archers and war mages can get great XP from level 1 by perching on either
      the tower by the LS, or in the fort. When the critters in the fort do not
      offer enough XP, or it has a full spawn (hard to handle solo till 20's)
      the beach to the east is covered in Golems, Sharks, and the other normal
      beach creatures.<br>

      Wasps, Mosswarts, Limestone Golems, Sandstone Golems and Sclavus up to

      <br>
      Undead and Zombies for the first ten levels. There are many around and
      they are easy to kill for an archer. At levels 7 or higher the Swamp
      Gromnies are good targets too. A sprinkle of Mud and Water Golems and
      Wasps makes life interesting. Stay clear of Mosswarts. Later, at level
      13-15, the Swamp Temple has lots of Mosswarts, and further down Limestone
      Golems and Sandstone Golems, followed by Sclavi. Swamp Temple even has a
      lifestone for those with lock picking.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Immacolata

      This is a great spot for young archers and mages. There is a lifestone
      right inside the fort. You can stand on the walls and shoot at the
      monsters both inside and outside of the fort. It is a short run from
      Cragstone where you can get supplies.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Meki

      </b>Recommended Levels: 1-10<br>
      <br>
      Creatures: Undead<br>
      <br>
      Undead are level 15.... but they are great experience. I have had level 1
      characters with 5 health and no super good stuff, just society weapons and
      some armor, who can solo this place from level one, if they are careful.
      If you have more health it is easier, but you can take it with 5 health if
      you are smart and cautious. They give great experience. If you
      successfully kill one with 5 health, then you get enough experience to
      raise your health to 8-10 or so, then kill another, etc.... I level here
      from 1 to 10 with ANY character I make. However, you need to get a
      lockpick mule or have your main to open a locked door, since that is the
      only place with undead.<br>

      THIS PLACE IS AWESOME FOR LVLING FROM 3-13. It provides undead behind
      closed doors for magic free easy xp ;). Melee only, though a lifemage
      might be able to drain the monsters. Toughest part is getting past the
      mountain shortcut area, so try to have a high level player buff and escort
      you there.</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Vonnegut of
