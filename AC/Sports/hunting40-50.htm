    Level 61 / Archer (3 School)</font><p align="left">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Hands down the greatest place for a high-level 
    archer to hunt. Every high-level archer should know about it, but on the 
    off-chance they don't... Sanctuary offers good experience and good loot 
    (both to keep and to sell). You can stick to the beaches to hunt in open 
    spaces or you can use the varied terrain in the jungle sections to defend 
    against ranged magic attacks. Most importantly, you don't have to have life 
    magic to survive, especially if you stick to the leeches and mag<span lang="en-us">uses</span> 
    which almost always use ranged attacks. I hunt other places with my friends 
    (OP, Aerlinthe), but I always come back to Sanctuary for solid solo archer 
    hunting. This place was made for us!<br>
    <br>
    Physical Protections: Leeches/Maguses use cold weapons; Sclavuses use acid 
    weapons; Putrids have both acid and fire physical attacks. Acid GSA is 
    therefore a popular choice around Sanctuary!<br>
    <br>
    Magical Protections: You will have every type of level 5 and 6 spell thrown 
    at you by Leeches, Maguses, and Sclavuses. Wear as many life protects as you 
    can, and make sure those Z and C keys are in good working order!<br>
    <br>
    Weapon Types: Bring at least fire (Leeches and Maguses) and slashing (Sclavuses, 
    Putrids, Zefirs, and Wasps).<br>
    <br>
    Special items dropped: Sanctuary is a great place to hunt for SIKs, dark 
    revenant thighbones, sclavus tongues, and large sclavus hides (to be made 
    into sclavus helmets).<br>
    <br>
    Other notes: Unless you have all of the life protects, hunt the Sclavuses 
    one or (at most) two at a time. They will close on you for melee attacks, 
    and the last thing you want is 3-4 Acid Stream 6s hitting you at once.<br>
    <br>
    Nalif Zefirs can be the bane of your exist<span lang="en-us">e</span>nce 
    around Sanctuary. They often don't appear on radar, fly really fast, follow 
    you forever, hit you for a lot of slashing damage, and fire high level magic 
    spells. I have Sixth Sense set to pick them out and I usually just run 
    around them. :)</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Moro San<span lang="en-us">

    Level 63/Pure Archer ( i.e. NO life magic)<br>
    <br>
    An Archer's paradise. Most monsters prefer to engage in long range combat 
    (missile and magical), making it easy for Archers to dodge. Some Sclavi and 
    all moarsmen will close to engage in hand to hand combat. Fortunately, the 
    attention radius of the moarsmen is small.<br>
    <br>
    Quality of Loot obtained from these monsters is significant (most of these 
    monsters are level 120+)<br>
    <br>
    When Fighting Moarsmen: make sure that your flame and acid banes are up.

    <font face="Arial" size="2">I love hunting on the Obsidian Plains. While 
    Coral <span lang="en-us">G</span>olems are good XP, the crowds bother me. On 
    the other hand, bandies are fine loot (either in Heiromancers Halls or 
    Aerlinthe), but the XP is poor, and unless you have recalll to Aerlinthe or 
    no tie (for the Halls) they are a mild pain to get to. My solution is to 
    hunt the Plains. I go out of Black Hill, but any portal will do.<span lang="en-us">
    </span>I like to take ou<span lang="en-us">t Shadows and Tuskers mostly,</span> 
    and vrindi can be fun as well. Avoid the <span lang="en-us">D</span>iamond
    <span lang="en-us">G</span>olems at all cost, and Altereds are a pain 
    because the<span lang="en-us">y</span> debuff your life/war skills.<br>
    <br>
    I advise getting as far from the portal as possible. Other players can be 
    dangerous on the Plains, if they drag stuff onto you. The Plains BSD is the 
    worst for this sort of stuff. You want to hunt Apes for XP and Shadow spawns 
    for loot. Once you are level 50-60, you should be able to tank entire spawns 
    with practice<span lang="en-us">;</span> otherwise<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
    draw the Umbris off. Try and find a set route that you are comfortable with, 
    so you know the spawn points. Since the July <span lang="en-us">(01) </span>
    patch, you can get some really big Tusker pulls (particularly towards the 
    Plains center), so be prepared to tank 10-20 apes at once. I would put up 
    all 7 life protects, although level Vs will suffice for all but bludgeoning 
    if you are careful. You can do fine in a robe with level VI item buffs, 
    although I like to buff my shirt as well when I am going to be tanking big 
    tusker spawns.<br>

    to PAY to have the priv<span lang="en-us">e</span>l<span lang="en-us">e</span>ge 
    to hunt. I usually drop by GW, give the Bobs a C note or so, and hop on my 
    way (or I give them things they could use and I don't need). <br>
    <br>
    On Aerlinthe all I hunted was bandies and drudges. Drudges can be found 
    easily on the OP now, and I can kill a guard faster then a Bandie. So I can 
    still make XP while earning loot. <br>
    <br>
    I sometimes hit Aerlinthe with a friend, and just hit the north dires portal 
    then obsidian rim. There's a lifestone right there so I (as an itemless 
    &quot;gimp&quot;) <span lang="en-us">c</span>an freely hunt the plains yet be able to 
    get back to my body if I should die, (which I try to avoid but hey,
    <span lang="en-us">l</span>uring does happen, and so do re<span lang="en-us">-</span>spawns.... 
    and also there's just my plain idiocy (Like the time I thought, Hey, I can 
    kill the director before the diamond golem gets up and gets here... The 
    Director Bludg Vulned me, The Diamond cast Force, then the Director did. Was 
    not a pretty si<span lang="en-us">ght</span>.)<span lang="en-us">).</span><br>
    <br>
    The varying critter population adds a flavor to it all. I sometimes go after
    <span lang="en-us">g</span>rie<span lang="en-us">v</span>vers, or just run 
    around looking for duals. <br>
    <br>
    Xbow (or any missile or magic) assists here. As Ned said in his one hunting 
    essay<span lang="en-us">,</span> <span lang="en-us">s</span>macking a 
    critter once rustles everything up. Hitting it again allows you to go one on 
    one. (Which helps out a lot ESPECIALLY due to the now overflowing population 
    of <span lang="en-us">v</span>irindi and tuskers on the OP. You hit one and

    I'm level 75 and have been tied to Sotiris since I was level 30 and could 
    get in the dungeon. This place is great for several reasons. I hunted inside 
    on strictly the swarm of Drudge Rav<span lang="en-us">ener</span>s and Stalkers (avoiding the Virindi 
    Masters which is very easy with practice). I did this until I was able to at 
    least hit the Masters (around level 35-40), then the xp REALLY started 
    pouring in (around 14k per Master). On a round of level 5/6 buffs I could 
    easily get 100-150k xps. The loot is kind<span lang="en-us"> </span>of weak on the Ravs but the Masters 
    can drop good stuff. Once I got brave enough, I ventured outside. I died 
    hard and often (but never went too far away from the portal) until I hit 
    level 50, then I could pretty much hold my own (knowing your limitations can 
    defin<span lang="en-us">i</span>t<span lang="en-us">e</span>ly save yer DI's<span lang="en-us"> 
    [death items]</span> here, i<span lang="en-us">.</span>e<span lang="en-us">.</span>, melees avoid Execs, mages avoid Hollows. 
    The loot outside can be incredible and the xps are excellent. Inside is a 
    great place to loose vitae (on Ravs and Masters) then quickly right back 
    outside to kill (and be killed of course).&nbsp; </font><p align="left">
