    <font face="Arial" size="2">As many of you may have seen, there's a new
    revealing dress in Dereth. Reaction has varied, from the obvious
    &quot;BOOBIES!!!&quot;, to genuine appreciation and delight, to strong
    disappointment. I dislike the dresses very much, but others, whose opinions
    I admire and respect, think they're a lot of fun! I expressed my concerns on
    CoD's Dev Board and quite an array of opinions burst forth.&nbsp;</font><font class="BaseMsgFont">
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Do I sound like I'm kidding?
    I am expressing a concern that the women avatars have had content added to
    make them &quot;sexier.&quot; I think this is a valid concern, as I have
    mentioned.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">I am not dictating what
    anyone can or cannot wear, I have not made claims about the people who
    choose to wear these clothes, I have been consistent about my very specific
    complaint. I have not claimed that the dress is obscene or that the dress
    itself is disrespectful to women. I have said that in my opinion it looks
    trashy.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">I may have even, in real
    life, on specific festive occasions, clad my own figure in charming gowns
    which display my bodacious ta-tas.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">My specific concern was this:</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">I think that if Turbine
    continues a trend which makes the women &quot;sexy,&quot; giving special
    treatment to the women and not to the men, it risks fostering a climate that
    I will not want to participate in long term. Sean has said, in this very
    thread, that they will not do this, and have strongly resisted doing this. I
    think comments like mine will reinforce that their decision is a wise one.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Voicing my concerns about how
    I as a woman want to be treated is not an overreaction. I think a gaming
    forum is as good a place as any to discuss societal issues, including
    feminism.<br>

    from the new island. Time will tell, I suppose.&nbsp; I understand there's

    I'll let the attached picture tell the whole story.&nbsp; Well... not the
    whole story.&nbsp; I still have to tell you how to get one of these for your
    own.<br>
    <br>
    Taken a look at the picture yet?&nbsp; Is that 'obvious' or what?&nbsp;

    Here's how to get your very own copy of this little red number just in case
    you've got a night of candlelight and romance planned.<br>
    <br>
    Take one of the new Aluvian dresses - I don't off-hand remember what they're
    called - to the Leather Crafter in West Newic.&nbsp; That's the female
    leather crafter standing beside the crates outside Davis' little 'tailor
    shack'.&nbsp; Make sure it's that woman *and no other*!!! She's the only one
    who alters dresses.&nbsp; <i>**All the other leather crafters I've tried just
    take the dress and don't give anything back.**</i><br>
    <br>
    Oh!&nbsp; Also;&nbsp; Umm... this is definitely NOT adventuress' gear.&nbsp;
    Er... well...&nbsp; I guess it could be, depending on the type of
    'adventure' she was seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp; But for just bounding down the road
    (and I do mean *bounding*) as you try to get from Point A to Point B...
    umm... well... try to keep the jumping over fallen logs to a minimum.&nbsp;
    'Nuff said?'<br>

    Read your commentary on the dresses, it sure generated lots of messages. :)<br>

    Here is another thought: How come it is Aluvuian dresses and leather
    crafters? What does this have to say (good or bad) about Aluvians and their
    view of women?<br>

    exploitation just because the programmers are having fun with a Holloween
    prank.<br>
    <br>
    What truly disturbs me, though, is the fact that more men than women are
    starting to wear these dresses. I mean... the look is just plain scary on
    them; what's with the creepy chest hair? If there is something to be upset
    about, its the fact that these big, burly, hairy guys are running around in
    low-cut dresses and scaring children. I mean, if they had smooth, muscular

      Dear Maggie --&nbsp;<br>
      I read your boobie page carefully. You are a fine and sensitive reporter.
      The boobie dress absolutely reminds me of Ultima Online -- where we both
      played for a year. I do not miss the Zena armor and other nonsense of that
      game. Zena armor looks great on Zena, by the way; I am a fan of the show.

      dropping banes on the dress, but I'm assuming it's possible. I know I've
      seen a few of them that have been dyed green.</font></p>

        I'm sorry I missed the discussion about the dress and about gender
        issues on the Dev board.&nbsp; I've got some things to say about these issues,
        but I don't know that the Dev board is where I'd want to do it.&nbsp; It takes
        some maturity to even discuss these matters, and message boards tend to have
        some immature and insensitive people on them.<br>
        <br>
        I've got about sixteen years of experience with role-playing games - the
        real ones, with pencils, paper, coke, chips, and friends.&nbsp; Most of
        the people I've played with were male, but many were female.&nbsp; Many of
        these people, including myself, played cross-gender characters
        sometimes.&nbsp; The person running the game who had to take on the role
        of all the NPCs had to play characters of both sexes regularly.&nbsp;
        For the most part, everyone's been okay with this.&nbsp; It's never been
        a big issue.<br>
        <br>
        I've also played several single-player computer/video games and read several good books where the protagonist was female.&nbsp; Many men have
        played Tomb Raider and read books from a female's perspective.&nbsp;
        Lots of people have preferences about this kind of thing, but few have
        serious problems with it.</font><br>
        <br>
        <font size="2" color="#FFFF99"><font face="Arial">
        Putting yourself in the place of someone of the opposite gender can be
        difficult sometimes.&nbsp; It requires maturity and concentration.&nbsp;
        If you're serious about it, it can be very rewarding.&nbsp; It can give
        new insight into the way people of the opposite sex may feel about
        things.&nbsp; Psychologists use role-playing to help people learn more
        about others and themselves.&nbsp; The author of the &quot;Men are from
        Mars&quot; books encourages us to consider how our spouse would feel
        about things before we speak.&nbsp; The Bible says to do unto others as
        we would have them do unto us.&nbsp; That old saying about &quot;walk a
        mile in somebody else's shoes&quot; comes to mind and...&nbsp; uhhh..
        I'm rambling now...<br>
        <br>
        Asheron's Call is a game though.&nbsp; It's also a community - a large
        community made up of people of different maturity levels with different
        ideas about how the game should be.&nbsp; These people are also mostly
        anonymous, and some see that as a license to be jerks.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Now when I played D&amp;D, if there were any issues about how women
        should be treated, or any issues about people being jerks, they could be
        addressed right there at the table (and they often were!).&nbsp; That's
        not so easy in Asheron's Call.</font><br>
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF99" size="2">
        The anonymity, the lack of accountability of one player to another, and
        the sense of community makes courtesy extremely important.&nbsp; The
        game developers cannot enforce courtesy, but they do have some influence
        over the way we interact with one another since they created the
        interface.<br>
        <br>
        It's hard to have courtesy if you don't have dignity.&nbsp; I think
        Asheron's Call has done a marvelous job of preserving the dignity of its
        female characters.&nbsp; They are tastefully rendered, and are given
        nice clothes and armor to wear.&nbsp; They're not sex objects.&nbsp;
        They do have nice figures, but so do the men, and such is the stuff of
        fantasy - everybody wants to be attractive.</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
        AC's respectful treatment of women was actually one of the things that
        attracted me and a friend to this game instead of EverQuest.&nbsp;
        EverQuest uses sex to sell the game, and often when a company has to
        resort to that, their product is found lacking.&nbsp; My friend has
        since tried EverQuest for a month and confirmed this.&nbsp; :)<br>

        <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
        As for the attention that female characters have been getting lately, I
        like it.&nbsp; I like the curtsey.&nbsp; I was surprised it wasn't in
        there in the first place actually.&nbsp; I like the new dresses.&nbsp;
        The unisex clothing and unisex emotes promoted sexual equality in the
        most literal sense, but &quot;sameness&quot; is not always the best
        &quot;equality&quot;.&nbsp; I think that's what you were saying when you
        said that Turbine should do something to make the male characters sexier
        too, to even things out now.&nbsp; That's kind of difficult though.&nbsp;
        As in the real world, men don't have as much help to make us visually
        attractive as the women do.&nbsp; Where women have cosmetics, endless
        styles of clothing (even men's clothing is not off-limits to women
        today), jewelry, lots of different hairstyles, polished nails, skin
        treatments, and probably more things that just aren't coming to mind
        right now, men mostly have to rely on clean clothes, a bath, and our
        natural wit and charm.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
 I'd like to see some masculine
        formalwear, though I don't know what would be appropriate for the
        setting of Asheron's Call.&nbsp; I'd like for everybody to have
        something nice to wear to a wedding.&nbsp; I think the devs may have
        accidentally opened up a whole new balance issue this month...&nbsp;</font><br>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
        As for what I think about the &quot;boobie&quot; dress in particular...&nbsp;
        I think it's good.&nbsp; It's new content, new options, new ways to
        customize your character, and it doesn't hurt anybody any more than you
        wearing a dress like that in the real world would hurt somebody.&nbsp;
        Giving people new options for their characters in the game, even options
        that we don't find appealing, is a good thing.&nbsp; It adds diversity
        to the world.&nbsp; Diversity is good!&nbsp;

 What's my personal opinion
        about the way at looks?; At the risk of jeopardizing the
        credibility of everything else I say in this letter, but in the spirit
        of complete honesty, I must say that I think they're sexy on the
        characters I've seen them on.&nbsp; Your friend Nandesu Ka does not look
        the least bit &quot;trashy&quot; in that picture on your page.; She
        looks every bit as regal and mysterious in that dress as she does in her
        Faran robe in her Runway picture.&nbsp; This may not be true of every
        character.<br>

        <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
        Would my female character wear one?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; Not
        unless there were a good occasion for it where it was appropriate.&nbsp;
        I think that wearing that dress around all the time for no good reason
        would be inviting the kind of attention that makes me sorry I have a
        female character.&nbsp; In-game flirting is just good role-playing and I
        have no trouble with that.&nbsp; It's just like in-game arguments or
        in-game talking.&nbsp; It's not &quot;real&quot; and it doesn't touch
        &quot;me&quot; any more than a banderling's club.&nbsp; When people
        start asking if I'm female in real life, however, I know that they're
        not interested in role-playing though, and I'm not interested in that
        kind of attention at all.&nbsp; Most people aren't.<br>

        As for your concern that Turbine may continue to make women sexier while
        ignoring the men... I don't think that will happen.&nbsp; Turbine has
        been very careful with their treatment of women in the game so far:&nbsp;
        There's no scantily-clad woman on the front of the box.&nbsp; Female
        characters can do everything male characters can do, and vice-versa.&nbsp;
        Women have played a major role in every aspect of the history of Dereth.&nbsp;
        The gaming industry<br>
        has a hard time reaching women, and I think that Turbine's got the right
        idea here.&nbsp; They've made female characters &quot;equal&quot; with
        male characters, and they've gone one step beyond that by developing new
        content specifically for female characters at the prompting of female
        players.<br>
        <br>
        I'm glad there are women like yourself in the AC community.&nbsp;
        Communities with no women are incomplete.&nbsp; It's just not right.&nbsp;

        We talked about the new dresses.&nbsp; She says that if Asheron's Call
        is a game where everyone is supposed to be a warrior of some sort, then
        making a point of showing off femininity (like dresses) only makes the
        women seem weaker and taken less seriously by the men. She thinks that
        if you just want to stand around and look pretty, that you should hang
        up the modem and go to the mall.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; She'd make a pretty
        tough monarch I think.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">I originally thought the dresses were a hoax; everyone was being
        tight-lipped about it. Then, I saw a spoiler.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly, I had a choice. I didn't have to go get one. But, then I
        looked in my RL closet. I have attractive clothes there. I wear dresses
        that are low-cut on formal occasions. I have RL boobs, and, when it's
        appropriate, I let people know that. And when I wear my RL dresses, I
        enjoy the compliments I receive. So, I went and got one. And then
        another, and dyed it green.<br>
        <br>
        I have worn my dresses around town, because it is the new thing to do.
        Yes, I have gotten lewd comments, which were reported. I have gotten
        compliments, which were appreciated and acknowledged, as is the polite
        thing to do. I have not &quot;used&quot; the dresses because I am not a
        prostitute.<br>
        <br>
        I now have a red dress and a green dress, along with all the others
        completing my wardrobe. When I return from fighting, and I have enough
        loot to freely spend pyreals, I will be found in one of my dresses,
        giving food (which I cook) and drink freely to all that want some. I
        will also sell some of the uber-foods, as my tradeskills are a source of
        income. When I'm in town, I'm going to be in a dress. When I am at a
        formal gathering, I will either wear a &quot;normal&quot; dress, or if I
        want to be &quot;seen&quot;, I'll be in one of the low-cut ones.<br>
        <br>
        Pretty close to real life.<br>
        <br>
        Now, if women become bimbo-ized in game, I'm leaving. When I change my
        clothes, I go into a private room, or behind some cover somewhere. I do
        not run through town in my underwear. If the game changes to armors that
        are merely lingerie in disguise, I'm gone. I would suggest that if the
        environment starts to deteriorate because of the dresses, that the only
        police force in the game be contacted...it's a code of conduct violation
        to make lewd comments to me. Screen capture, and report the offense. If
        women are proactive early on when this occurs, the prepubescent among
        the players will get the message - &quot;Keep your one-handed fun to
        yourself.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Go ahead and tell me I'm bringing all the cat-calls upon myself, and
        what a hypocrite I am to turn-in those that make them. The code of
        conduct allows the dress; the code of conduct doesn't allow lewd
        language.<br>

        I'd like to protest a bit

        male upper body w/o clothes and armor is a bit more explicit than the
        female's. I mean, I'm ripped underneath all that armor. ;-p<br>
        Also, I bet very few people will wear them, and I personally trust the
        female audience of AC to make their own decisions as to whether or not
        they want their &quot;ta-tas&quot; shown. I think people should take
        this as a joke, which is pointed out by the fact that there are more
        guys wearing the dresses than girls. ;-p<br>

        Within one day of
        starting to play AC, I had male characters sending me such enchanting
        requests as:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;cybersex me I will give u C note&quot;<br>
        <br>
        I was just standing around shopping, wearing the normal non-provocative
        AC sorts of armor.&nbsp; I was targeted for no other reason than that I
        was playing a female character.<br>
        <br>
        I don't object to sexual content.&nbsp; Any social medium tends to have
        at least some; it's in the nature of humanity.&nbsp; What I object to is
        game-coded asymmetry in sexual content.<br>
        <br>
        A game that provides sexualized content only for the female characters
        and not the males is asymmetrical.&nbsp; It would have been nice for
        Turbine to provide new formal wear for males as well as females.&nbsp;
        The dresses in general are wonderful, but where are Sho, Aluvian, and
        Gharu'ndim formal wear for males?&nbsp; This would have been a wonderful
        opportunity to extend the culture and lore for the Isparian races, and I
        think they missed out on it.<br>
        <br>
        If they *must* provide a &quot;wonder dress&quot;, then can they please
        provide an equal and opposite &quot;wonder cup&quot; for male
        characters?&nbsp; This would go a long way toward preserving the
        equality they have always been fairly scrupulous about showing.&nbsp;
        Note that the simple fact that someone spent time and attention
        designing this thing emphasizes its presence.... and the absence of its
        counterpart.<br>
        <br>
        I don't really want AC to turn into the kind of place where I could say
        &quot;Oh, adult women can have fun here, because they know how to deal
        with sexual harassment, but it might be too harsh for your twelve year
        old daughter.&quot;&nbsp; There is something wrong with a gaming circle
        which is friendly to twelve year old boys and is unpleasant for twelve
        year old girls.<br>
        <br>
        Asymmetrical amounts of sexual content in the game will foster a differing experience along gender lines, even as asymmetric sexual
        standards in real life tend to lead to girls getting shut out of gaming
        in general: why spend time and effort at something when the boys are
        picking on you for no other reason than being a girl?&nbsp; When the
        game designers emphasize sexuality over every other feminine
        characteristic, which simply supports this attitude?<br>
        <br>
        Asheron's Call has been refreshingly free of asymmetrical sexual content, up to this point.&nbsp; One dress does not necessarily hurt in
        itself, but it does if it's a significator of future trends.&nbsp; EverQuest
        is often brought up as an example in these discussions, and one of the
        reasons I chose AC over EQ, *despite* having many friends there who
        would have given me a built-in support structure, was because I spoke
        with a female friend who plays there and found out how constantly she
        was harassed there while she was getting established.&nbsp; It is not
        nonexistent in AC, but it's well within my patience limits.<br>

        a review of a game where it says the marketing efforts towards women
        are:&nbsp; &quot;Fairly neutral as there were no women in the game at
        all.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Think about that.&nbsp; This is a game about settling cities.&nbsp; I
        find it deeply, deeply, sad when invisibility of women's efforts in
        settling cities (what were they doing?&nbsp; Did they just show up later
        and move in to all that hard work only the men did?) is considered
        &quot;fairly neutral&quot;.&nbsp; This is because most other computer
        games portray women as passive victims in scanty clothing, and any
        change from that is<br>
        refreshing.<br>
        <br>
        I don't want invisibility.&nbsp; I don't want asexuality.&nbsp; I just
        want equality; is that so much to ask?<br>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Hey Girlfriend,<br>
        <br>
        I'm going to do something rather difficult and try to be serious for a<br>
        moment.&nbsp; I think this whole issue of 'Boobie Dresses' deserves
        that.<br>
        <br>
        First and foremost - kudos to you again, Maggie.&nbsp; I can see from
        your<br>
        comments that you and others have genuine feelings on this topic and
        that<br>
        those feelings are not all in agreement.&nbsp; &quot;Love it or hate
        it&quot; you say.&nbsp;<br>
        There are people who seem to do both.&nbsp; You have presented both
        sides of the issue fairly and with equal respect.&nbsp; That's
        admirable.&nbsp; Not everyone would be so egalitarian.&nbsp; One more
        reason why your site is truly 'kick ass' quality.<br>
        <br>
        Now, as to my own feelings . . .<br>
        <br>
        When I first saw that dress (and that would be when I first put it on in<br>
        Davis' shop) I burst out laughing.&nbsp; As I've said, it was just so
        terribly<br>
        'obvious' - both literally and figuratively - that, at the time, I
        decided<br>
        the boobie dress had to be a bit of a practical joke by the guys at
        Turbine.&nbsp; You know - sort of a Derethian version of an Elvira
        costume and therefore in keeping with the Halloween season that
        currently reigns in-game.<br>
        <br>
        But then I got to reading the 'comments against' on your site and I
        began to think again.<br>
        <br>
        Here's what I've decided.<br>
        <br>
        I hear what you and especially Lum are saying and now that I think about
        it, I agree with and share your concerns.&nbsp; On deeper reflection -
        if the boobie dress was a practical joke - maybe the punchline wasn't
        all that funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        However, I don't think that the cause of women's rights and women's
        dignity will be much damaged by the introduction of boobie dresses into
        Asheron's Call.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe Sean when he says that this is not
        the first step down a slippery slope.<br>
        <br>
        I don't think we'll be seeing chain mail bikinis as a *mandatory - all
        or nothing* replacement for our cherished mattie coats any time soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If we do, you can believe that I'll be one of the first ones out the
        door.<br>
        <br>
        Like you and others, I've always admired the way AC lets women succeed
        or fail on their own merits.&nbsp; &quot;Strap on a shield, get a good
        sword, practice those trade and magic skills diligently and you can get
        just as far as the boys can, just as fast.&quot;&nbsp; I admire the fact
        that the world of Dereth has its fair share of strong, female heroes
        -and yes, some despicable female villains as well.<br>
        <br>
        So, what impact does the introduction of boobie dresses have on this
        world?&nbsp; As Lum asks, 'What kind of character would wear that kind
        of dress?'<br>
        <br>
        Does the introduction of boobie dresses relegate all women of Dereth to
        the role of &quot;characters cloyingly feminine with extremely feminine
        names and clothing&quot;?&nbsp; Scheming little tramps who use gender
        as tool to get their way instead of exerting any genuine effort?<br>
        <br>
        Do Wonder Bras and Ally McBeal microskirts relegate all real-world women
        to that same role?&nbsp; What kind of woman wears them?&nbsp; Heck, what
        kind of woman wears a bikini to the beach instead of a plain, high-neck
        maillot?&nbsp; A scheming little tramp?&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        And sometimes she's just a woman who enjoys being a woman and showing
        that fact off.<br>
        <br>
        Though I'm mindful of and, for the most part, share the *genuine*,
        *valid* concerns raised by you and Lum and others - I'm going to keep my
        boobie dress.&nbsp; (Stashed at the bottom of my mule's backpack,
        probably.&nbsp; I do like that dress.&nbsp; But as I say, it's not an
        every day wear item.)<br>
        <br>
        The guys at Turbine have allowed me to be a woman in Dereth, if I so
        choose.&nbsp; More to the point, with the introduction of the boobie
        dress, they've given me the right to be a politically incorrect woman,
        if I so choose.<br>
        <br>
        Some people are going to abuse that right.&nbsp; There are going to be
        &quot;cloying little tramps with overly feminine names&quot; running
        around, flaunting boobs instead of using brains and honest effort to get
        along in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like in the real world, that's the
        price you pay for having rights - people will abuse them.<br>
        <br>
        Does that kind of right, and the attendant issues it creates, belong in
        a fantasy game like AC?&nbsp; I suggest that's the real issue here.&nbsp;
        Sean and the rest of the gang at Turbine have (perhaps unintentionally -
        who knows?) chosen to introduce that right and those issues into their
        creation.&nbsp; It's their right to do so, and to remove them if, upon
        reflection, they choose to do so.&nbsp; If they choose to keep 'boobie
        dresses' in AC, it's then up to each player to decide if he or she wants
        to continue to participate in the newly created society of Dereth.<br>
        <br>
        I've decided that I'm willing to pay the price of having that right -
        the right to be a decidedly feminine and yes, perhaps even a bit
        'obvious' female.&nbsp; If for that payment I can occasionally set down
        my sword and my shield, curl up beside a fire in some cozy little inn
        with that special someone and enjoy a fantasy that doesn't revolve
        around my mattie hide armor coat.<br>
        <br>
        Love me or hate me for it - that's *my* choice.<br>
