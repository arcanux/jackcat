    Maggie<span class="EmailStyle15"> &#150; Here is a report on my AC activities. Where to
    begin? I will start at the end, at the result. <o:p></o:p></span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span class="EmailStyle15"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I have no armor at
    all, not a stitch. Except some crummy utility stuff I bought over the counter in Holtburg,
    to clothe my nakedness and protect me for the remainder of the run down to Cragstone. I
    lost almost everything else as well; my heals, my lovely Ivory Yumi with the cool Blood
    Drinker III magic on it, my arrows, my cool magic sleeves, my wonderful AL 90 leather
    shirt that you gave me, my magic gloves that cast 15 points of coordination on me, my
    heume, my Yoroi leggings that you gave me, my solerettes. Sigh. <o:p></o:p></span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span class="EmailStyle15"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I retained my Armor
    III silk shirt, which was good, and all 4 jewelry items, which was good. I converted most
    of the money I had to mana stones, because there was no way to carry it and the vendor did
    not sell trade notes. So I do have the equivalent of about 30,000 or so in mana stones,
    maybe less or more.<o:p></o:p></span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The good news?
    Well, I didn&#146;t die, ever! Not on the run up, through unfamiliar territory, not on the
    run down, virtually naked! Now, THAT was hair-raising; 33 clicks to the first lifestone! A
    VERY long run, 86.6N/21.6E to the lifestone at 53.6N/24.2E. On the way up I hit two
    intermediary lifestones, but chose the straighter, faster shot for the naked return.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">He<span class="EmailStyle15">re is the gist of
    the debacle. I arrived at the vendor without incident. All was quiet, no monsters or
    interference. He had the robes. They were, I think, 50109 py, or somesuch. But, then, I
    encountered a problem I COULD have anticipated but hadn&#146;t thought of. The vendor,
    like all other vendors in the game, will not take trade notes as direct payment. You
    can&#146;t buy anything with trade notes. You must CONVERT them to money and THEN make
    your purchase. <o:p></o:p> </span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The vendor was
    happy to buy my trade notes, at the normal conversion rate. But 50,000 py is far to much
    for me to carry, even standing still. I can tell you that 300% burden is the maximum
    allowed. Beyond that you can&#146;t pick up or create additional burden. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p>So I couldn&#146;t
    convert more than about 30,000 in notes. What to do? What to do? On obvious work-around
    occurred to me. The robe I wanted to buy didn&#146;t weigh much at all. If I could drop my
    possessions on the ground, I might be able to free up enough burden-carrying capacity to
    convert the trade notes to cash and complete the purchase of the robe. Then I could simply
    pick up my stuff and be none the worse off. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"></o:p>So I proceeded. But
    I was only able to convert 40,000 by dropping my spell components and arrows and so forth.
    I removed my armor, piece by piece. I dropped my precious Ivory Yumi. Finally, I dropped
    every single stitch I had on, all the wands and jewelry and nearly everything. At that
    point I was able to convert 48,xxx py, and it looked as though I wasn&#146;t going to be
    able to do it. But I took off the remaining very few things, curious about exactly how
    close I&#146;d come. I was thinking ahead, you see, to the telling of the tale. I was
    coming to see that I&#146;d have to return when I had more strength and wanted to know
    just how much more I&#146;d need.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Can you guess what
    happened then? A system announcement flashed up, saying that the servers were all going
    down for installation of an update. To be fair, I had been notified of this when I logged
    in. They used one of those windows button thingies, so it was unmistakable &#150; they
    even gave the exact time and, looking with awful understanding at my watch, I realized
    that the time had arrived. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I scrambled to
    recover what I could, but my Ivory Yumi was BURIED under mounds of other items. I could
    see it, sticking out beneath sacks of stuff, I highlighted it, but couldn&#146;t pick it
    up. I had to first get rid of MONEY to create room. I had a brief chuckle, thinking of the
    monkey trap, which grasps a monkey&#146;s fist within a container, holding the monkey
    because it is too greedy to let go of the food it holds in its fist, the fist too large to
    withdraw from the opening.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"></o:p>But I was a quick
    thinker, I didn&#146;t panic. The vendor, as I said earlier, did not sell trade notes at
    all. Curious, but that&#146;s the fact of it. I needed two things: 1) A fast way to drop
    money. This was not trivial; I was surrounded by stuff, and I knew from the experience of
    having dropped it that the game makes it tough once the free area is filled. Dropping the
    money would be very hard. It would also be nice, not essential to 2) Be able to keep as
    much of the cash as I could.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">So I started buying
    mana stones. That worked very well; bang, bang, bang. They had some HUGE mana stones, so I
    was dropping 7500 at a crack. That got the burden down. I started trying to pick things
    up, but it was just not working. Lag or something. I got my magic shirt, my rings, and
    &#133;.gurgle, glug &#150; the server disconnect sound came up. It was NOT two minutes, it
    was hardly one minute, closer to 30 seconds. Fuck.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span class="EmailStyle15"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">When I went back
    on, after the update, there I was, safe and sound. But everything that had been on the
    floor was gone, all of it. <o:p></o:p></span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span class="EmailStyle15"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o:p></o:p>I put on my magic
    silk shirt and mounted my rings and started running. Hit the lifestone in 33 clicks, then
    on to Holtsburg for some crummy store-bought armor, the run to Cragstone and a portal to
    Zaikhal. I logged out on the roof. Whew.<o:p></o:p></span></span></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I am sad about my
    nice stuff. Sigh. My beautiful Yumi. My cool lower sleeve things and gloves and all the
    rest. What a ridiculous experience! Really, it was too stupid. The only interesting thing
    was 1) that the run up itself was not all that dangerous; you could have accompanied me
    with near-perfect safety. 2) there was an neat castle up there, Castle Ninneva, or
    somesuch; kinda cool. Full town services, nearly.<o:p></o:p><br>

    <em>Where to begin? I will start at the end, at the result. </em><br>
    <br>
    God, I hate it when you tell me these stories, because they are so preventable. I blame
    myself. I *almost* reminded you that the servers were coming down, so don't do anything
    important around that time. (I must tell you that I just *knew* you were going to get in
    trouble with the servers in some way. It is so like you!) I *almost* warned you about the
    weight of py to give you a head's up that you might not be able to cash it all in. I
    *almost* gave a Strength III gem, just in case you needed it for this very reason. I
    *almost* suggested you carry an extra bag to put your armor on the ground in one lump, in
    case your burden was too high.<br>
    <br>
    I am slightly annoyed at your losses. You know how much less I am able to play than you
    are. Those pieces of armor represented hours of valuable game time for me. I scoured the
    lands looking for nice things for you, to be a good patron. Ha. Actually, I do have some
    back-up stuff on my mule. A nice girth, head piece, some chain leggings with a nice AL.
    Nothing exceptional, but they will be better than what you have. <br>
    <br>
    <em>1) A fast way to drop money. This was not trivial; </em><br>
    <br>
    Ok, I am sorry that you didn't know the keyboard command to drop stuff. Highlight and
    press the &quot;v&quot; key. It is a trick that some evil people use on newbies to steal.
    They say, press the &quot;v&quot; key and it will show you the weapon's secret spell.
    Then, of course, the item falls to the ground and they steal it. I believe there is also a
    similar command to put something in your backpack. I would have to look it up, though.<br>
    <br>
    <em>I am sad about my nice stuff. Sigh. My beautiful Yumi. </em><br>
    <br>
    I am really sorry to hear about your Yumi. Really. We will find you another one!<br>
    <br>
    It will be Ok. We will have you suited up, better than ever, in no time. And it will be a
    story for you to tell your vassals one day!<br>
