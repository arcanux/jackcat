    We are truly in an age of discovery in our new land of Dereth. Thanks to intrepid
    adventurers who have unearthed ancient clues in inhospitable environs such as the
    Direlands and the Lost City of Frore, we know more and more about our predecessors on the
    island, the Empyrean. Our gathered peoples recently rediscovered the process by which to
    create Lord Atlan's marvelous weapons. And now, I and my associates have unearthed the
    secrets of the mysterious crystals that come from the beasts which even now threaten our
    towns.<br>
    <br>
    For some time now, brave wayfarers in our new land of Dereth have been finding strange
    crystals on the corpses of slain shadows and crystal beasts. For many cycles, the
    provenance of these objects regrettably remained in obfuscation. Knowing my reputation as
    a learned man with much experience in the esoteric arts, some curious adventurers brought
    their gems to me. Now, thanks to my research, the secrets of the crystals has come to
    light.<br>
    <br>
    Strangely enough, one is able to combine crystals of comparable size. I began to
    experiment with the smallest specks of shadow essence and the cracked, flawed remnants
    that came from the weakest of the crystal monsters. They readily bonded into a single gem
    that was dark as night, but occasionally emanated flashes of light, which I can only
    speculate results from the combination of the innate dark magic of one element and the
    brightness of its counterpart. With my attunement to the properties of magic, I was also
    able to detect a faint core of powder within the compund [sic] jewel.<br>
    <br>
    Excitedly, I repeated my experiments with larger pieces, which grew in both brightness and
    in stored power. The very largest shards of shadow and crystal combined into very large
    gems, reservoirs of considerable power. The largest amalgamated gems have pulses of light.
    The gems, obviously, are powerful items. I had just turned my mind to the task of finding
    practical applications to them when I received news from my associates, Gondo Kanezo, Sage
    of the Sho nation, and Zarea bint Zea, the Gharu'ndim Sage.<br>
    <br>
    I share all my knowledge with my esteemed colleagues of Sho and Gharu'n, as well as with
    skilled craftworkers in my acquantance. They, in turn, passed the knowledge onto
    accomplished artisans in their lands, all in the effort to find a use for these mysterious
    but tantalizingly powerful gems. Finally, almost simultaneously, three metalsmiths in the
    three lands found ways to melt and refine the fused gems, and use the distilled essence of
    the gems in a very intricate metal alloying process. The strength and lightness of the
    metal thus produced is unparalleled.<br>
    <br>
    These honored and skilled crafters are named Aleane the Steelforger, Jibril ibn Rashid,
    and Koga Hideki. They have taken up residence in, respectively: Eastham, al-Jalima and
    Kara. They are to be commended not just for their ingenuity and skill, but for their
    generosity. For they have offered to craft suits of armor for those who bring them fused
    gems, all to help in the effort against the shadows which stalk our land.</small></font></td>
