    Delight*&nbsp; I&#146;ve got the bravest, strongest, smartest . . . *best-est* brother in
    all Dereth!<br>
    <br>
    Look what Obunaga got for me!&nbsp;&nbsp; My *very own* Mattie-hide coat!
    &nbsp;&nbsp; *Mine!*&nbsp; Not a hand-me-down!&nbsp; It seems Bunny (umm ... that&#146;s
    &#145;Obunaga&#146; to you) heard that I was really blue about the time it was taking for
    him to get that pesky last Dark Speck and so my *wonderful*, *considerate* ... well, you
    get the idea ... brother dropped everything and went out hunting Great Matties until he
    finally got a hide.</font></font><font size="3"></p>

    <p align="left"></font><font face="Arial" size="2">There&#146;s a cute little story behind
    how he gave it to me too.&nbsp; Last evening I was in the kitchen fixing supper.&nbsp; I
    knew it was about the time Bunny usually came dragging in after a long, hard day of
    kicking monster butt.&nbsp; Sure enough, I&#146;d just put some left-over rabbit stew on
    to simmer ... (Okay, I&#146;m not the greatest hunter in the world and I&#146;m sort of
    limited as to what kind of meat I put on the table.&nbsp; In other words; we eat a lot of
    rabbit.&nbsp; It&#146;s either that or ...&nbsp; would *you* eat Skulker Soup?) ... when
    through the door came Bunny, dragging his pack and tracking mud all over the floor I&#146;d
    spent the whole morning scrubbing.<br>
    <br>
    I was about to give him holy hell for the mud when, without even a &#145;hello, sis&#146;,
    he up-ends his pack and this bloody pile of mangy white fur lands with a wet thud right in
    the middle of the kitchen table!&nbsp; I stared at that mass of smelly animal hide
    dripping yeech all over the place and ... well, the scream kind of collided with all the
    curses and the best I could manage was this strangled squeak.<br>
    <br>
    Oh, it&#146;s a good thing those curses didn&#146;t get out before Bunny muttered,
    &quot;Heard you were looking for one of these.&quot; Then he slouched over to the stew pot
    and grumbled, &quot;Rabbit?&nbsp; *Again?*&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Oh girlfriend ... I threw a bunch of luke-warm stew in a bowl, gave Bunny a big, wet kiss
    on the cheek and high-tailed it down to the leather crafter.<br>
    <br>
    The result is what you see in the enclosed photo.&nbsp; </font><font size="3"></p>
    <p align="left"></font><font SIZE="2"><font face="Arial">Amazing what you can make out of
    a heap of smelly fur, isn't it?&nbsp; Chic, or what?<br>
    <br>
    Anyway ... Bunny&#146;s back to hunting Shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s just a matter of
    time now before he gets that last dark speck.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he&#146;s off to Kara
    because the big boo ... umm ... big darling has his heart set on some &#145;heritage&#146;
    Koujia armor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Men.&nbsp; No fashion sense at all.&nbsp; I&#146;ll be sure to
    send you along pictures when he gets the first (and with his luck at getting the parts,
    his only) half of the armor.<br>

    This picture is just kind of to keep you in the loop.&nbsp; I figure I've had my moment of
    fame on the Runway and I don't want to hog the spotlight. <br>
    <br>
    Unless you really want to twist my arm, that is.&nbsp; *shoving arm in your face for
    twisting* I also included the stats for a Mattie coat.&nbsp; Since you see so many of them
    these days, I thought you might like to post the 'numbers'.&nbsp; (And by the way; no, it
    doesn't bother me a bit to be wearing the same outfit as everyone else.&nbsp; It's so
    functional ... so 'works with everything' ... that I think of the Mattie hide coat as
    Dereth's equivalent to 'the little black dress'. Now all I need is a string of pearls. :)<br>
    <br>
    Talk to ya later. :)<br>
