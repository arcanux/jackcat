<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><u>About the <strong>Old Ring</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">From The Aerlinthe Record: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>RE 222: Loritane sends sixteen great
ocean-galleons and two skyships to the island, carrying the supplies necessary to build a
mining outpost. Lord Loritane and Lady Raina accompany the vessels in Tinoriel. The
navigation channel into the lagoon is dredged. Reservoir dug to collect rainwater. All
local water sources tainted with sulphur and ash. An Old Ring, buried under ash and
ejecta, is found during the digging. It is left undisturbed, but considered a good omen.
The island is titled Aerlinthe by Lord Loritane, a name which came to him in a dream. The
central volcano is known of old to be called Tenkarrdun, Dericost for &quot;Stoic
Blood.&quot; The smaller peaks to the northwest and northeast are found to have been named
Cunara (&quot;Steaming Heights&quot;) and Ernassen (&quot;Land Reflected&quot;),
respectively. The lagoon is dubbed Raina's Harbor. </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">So because of the loose wording you can't
assume it means 'ring' like a Menhir ring or 'ring' like jewelry... but then we get this
from from Garaena the Emissary : </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>&quot;My mistress sent me hither to
solicit their aid in a great cause. Perhaps you could serve, for I shall call the enemy of
mine enemy friend. Those in shadow...thralls of the one called Slayer of Hope...beset our
isle. If you give me a note worth 50,000 of the Yalaini pyreal, to fund my mission to
bribe the Sand Kings, I shall open the gate for you. <br>
The voice in your mind purrs, &quot;Ai, this will serve. Seek the dark ones and destroy
them...yet meddle not with the devices on the island of Aerlinthe. Perilous they are to
those who do not understand their art.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">So we hear that the 'mistress' wants some
shadows slain... again the wording was somewhat loose... &quot;those in shadow&quot; not
specifically 'those shadows'... but assuming she meant the shadows then we get this from
Smith Ejan in the town: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>Smith Ejan says, &quot;Suvani hasode,
Metresa, tamaa Der Hallae.&quot; <br>
In your mind, the dusty voice of Ejan whispers, &quot;Yes. The Shadows remain below,
Mistress, at the Old Ring.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Ok... tie it all together and it makes
sense... look at the </a><a href="res.htm">map</a> of the
second part of the Reservoir... it is a magma section deep in the volcano somewhere... it
opens into cavern that encircles the drop point room, shadows all over it and standing
stones... loosely placed all in a huge circle. The rough map illustrates the formation ...
this resembles a Menhir ring type formation hence the obvious conclusion is this is the
'Old Ring&quot; mentioned in the text. We killed all the shadows and nothing special
happened. No special items, nothing. Seems this whole section was just to lead to the
Repair Golem in an earlier step in the quest.</font></p>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><u>About the<strong>
Gromnietross aerie<br>
<br>
</strong></u>From the Aerlinthe Record:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em>RE 274: The Blessing of Aerlinthe. A gromnatross
makes her aerie on the peaks of Cunara. She is named Aurlanaa by the people of the port. </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">(Aerie; n. A nest, usually on a high crag or
mountainside, of a bird of prey.) <br>
Cunara is the peak to the west of Tenkarrdun as mentioned in entry RE 222 of the Aerlinthe
Record. If you go up on top of this peak, you find an </a><a
href="aerie.jpg">area that resembles a nest</a>. Inside
the nest is a handful of Ash Gromnies. Nowhere else on the island do you find these. When
in the aerie, the immediate area is <a
href="lightning.jpg">blinded by lightning</a> every few
seconds and you can hear voices similar to what you hear when standing on mana pools in
meeting halls. Within the limits of the game engine, I believe this was Turbines way of
confirming for us that Gromnies are in fact young gromnietross. Some people have mentioned
things such as &quot;If they are gromnitross, where are their wings? Why don't we have any
gromnietross? Where are they all coming from? etc etc&quot;...<br>
If you look closely, Gromnies do in fact have tiny wings as you can see in this <a
href="gromnie02.jpg">diagram</a>. As for where are the
Gromnietross... where are the grown up gromnies etc etc... well Turbine would probably
explain that much the same way they explain about human children. &quot;They are just
off-camera&quot;. From what I gather, the current engine does not allow for flying
enemies. If you examine Zefirs and wasps, the models have lower half, like invisible poles
holding them up which is why when you examine a wasp or zefir corpse the cursor covers the
size of a human instead of the clump of monster on the ground. They are just the same as
panum or umbris, walking on the ground but the lower half invisible. So instead of leaving
it out completely, I think they added this to throw us a bone. After seeing all the
interest in the gromnietross on the boards by the lore people etc. <br>
<br>
Next mention in the record:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em>RE 895: Aurlanaa leaves her aerie on the peak of
Cunara. She meets several other gromnatross south of Aerlinthe, and they ascend,
disappearing into the heavens. No gromnatross are seen on Auberean for twenty-two years.
Severe lightning-storms and strange glows come over the southeast waters. The population
is evacuated to the west. Darkness falls upon the shores of Ireth Lassel. A vast reach of
Black Madness and fifteen Thorns accompany the Hopeslayer, his generals, and their army.
Darkness defeated. The Hopeslayer is entrapped in the mage council's array. The explosive
power released destroys the Jailne Lyceum, kills the entire council, and shatters the
array into pieces. One piece lands on Aerlinthe, but is recovered before it can dig itself
into the ground. With the defeat of the Hopeslayer, the Rhethis Eipoth (Era of Lore) is
concluded by decree of Emperor Caerlin. The Torethis Eipoth (Second Era of Lore) is
declared. </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">So Aurlanaa leaves and not long after is when the
Hopeslayer shows up. This I think is what started the Clark Kent/Superman syndrome about
Gromnietross having something to do with the Hopeslayer... much like when Clark Kent
leaves the room Superman shows up and vice versa. Or maybe it was like birds flying south
for the winter... Gromnietross fly wherever they flew for the season of darkness. Either
way it is just speculation until we have more text confirming something to verify one
theory or another.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The last 2 entries referring to Gromnietross may tie
into something else later on... but they don't seem to have any relevance to anything we
have uncovered up to this point.<em><br>
<br>
TE 17: The Return of Grace. The gromnatross come down from the stars. Aurlanaa alights
upon her aerie at Cunara. She looks into the eye of Kelderam, a ward of Ithaenc since her
early 100's, and considered hopelessly mad. Kelderam is jauniril*, and lapses into
unconsciousness. When she awakens, she weeps for a full day, and is afterwards restored in
mind and spirit. In her waning years, Kelderam led the Adjanite Order, and was renowned
for her wisdom and serenity. (*Translator's note: By context, &quot;jauniril&quot; would
seem to be a verb. I have never encountered this word before, however, and know not what
it means. - Bretslef) </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em>HE 348: The Rejection. Troops returning from
Valind's desecration and sack of Ithaenc climb Cunara to seek Aurlanaa's blessing. The
gromnatross slays them all on sight, and departs Aerlinthe, never to be seen again. </em></font></p>

Keep</strong></u></font></p>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">From the Aerlinthe Record:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em>RE 208: Shimena Keep constructed on the
northeast islet. Shimena guarded the northern approaches to Ireth Lassel research colony
from Pelagian sea-nomads. <br>
<br>
</em>This keep is found at 91.4n 49.7e, on the NE of the island like the entry stated. It
is a large fortress infested with Diamond and Plasma Golems, Relic and Cursed Bones, and
Dark Revnants. The beach surrounding the fort is guarded by Vapor Golems and pressure
plates that trigger bolts of lightning that come shooting out of the statues that line the
tops of the walls of the Keep. If you step on one of these pressure plates a second time,
you may get a message about somethign recharging. This is just the towers that shot at you
recharging for another shot. Inside, you find the three landmarks mentioned later in the
Record as detailed below. Inside the Skytower, a portal to North Yanshi Advocate Tower can
be found. This is one of the only 2 portals on Aerlinthe that lead off the island. The
standing stone can't be selected or used and neither can the tree. You can see the
locations of these landmarks in the </a><a

any importance has turned up in the Keep yet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>TE 333: The mutilated corpse of the
missionary Lady Galaeral of Ithaenc is found off the north shore. </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>TE 334: Imperial Inquisitor Lady Alibec

<br>
TE 422: Piteous screams are heard from behind the door Inquisitor Alibec sealed in 334. It
is forced open, but the room is empty, and the scene of Galaeral's murder remains as it
was when the door was erected. Shrieks of pain and incomprehensible, mumbling chants are
occasionally heard from the room, leading workers to whisper that the missionary's soul
remains in torment at the place of her death. </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The room described in these entries is located on
the second floor of the Olthoi section in the </a><a

see where by looking at <a href="res2.htm">Nodoko's maps</a>
of this section. In the room is an altar with restraints hanging off the sides, covered in
blood. The walls and floor are also covered in blood as you can see <a
href="altar_room.jpg">here</a>. No monsters spawn in the
room. On the floor beside the altar is where you find the &quot;<a
href="sacdagger.jpg">Sacrificial Dagger</a>&quot;. The
'shrieks of pain and incomprehensible, mumbling chants' can be heard in stereo while you
are inside the chamber. A woman screaming, a demon talking backwards... very interesting
sounds. I have provided a <a href="moans.mp3">MP3</a> of
these sounds to give you a better idea of the atmosphere in the room. You can hear Olthoi
in the background, only because they were all at the door to the chamber trying to get in.
The chamber branched off from one of the olthoi tunnels. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">An area that was discussed on the boards not too
long ago seems to be where this passage describes. it is near Baishi, a small hill with a
Hopeslyer statue at the base in the middle of a pond, surrounded by statue heads. </a><a
href="hill.jpg"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to see
pics. From the pond to the peak of the hill there are piles and pile of bones, some of
which come alive and attack. At the top is a Skel Lord standing next to another statue
head, except this head has a contorted face as you can see in the pic above. Also, to add
to the possibility,&nbsp; the room where Lady Aerfalle was defeated had benches all facing
one of the same statue heads. Like a worship altar. <a

<font class="BaseMsgFont">

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A few bits of support for the hill being the site of the battle
There's a few passages above the paragraph you sited that also point to this place being
the right one: </font></p>

<p><i><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">So did we join, if only once, in the <b>southern forests of
Ifistra</b>. The Winds rose from their hidden lairs, and the Lords marched from their
bastions. While the hedge-mages struggled to rekindle the flame of old Facill's knowledge,
the Battle of Ayn Tayan raged for three days. At cost, we held off their army. <b>The
barbarians, long since fled to the west of Killiakta</b>, never knew. But we saved them.
The children of Old Dericost fought and won a final battle, holding the line until their
trap was prepared, and the Servant's curiosity piqued. If not for us, all would have
perished. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Ifistra is the Dericost name for Osteth (the civilized eastern
