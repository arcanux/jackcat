<a NAME="#start">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Ok, starting from the very beginning. Two
Emissaries from <strong>Aerlinthe</strong> appear in Dereth. One in <strong>Chalicmere
Fortress</strong> (17.7s 57.4w), and one at a group of temples in South Dires. (87.6s
65.6w). (The same temples that now house the remains of the Sand King Anadil.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Upon entering <strong>Chalicmere Fortress</strong>,
you will see </a><a href="emissary2.jpg"><strong>Faladha
the Emissary</strong></a> and hear these messages broadcast to the area:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The dead man turns and looks down
the rotted remains of his nose at you. A cool, Aristocatic presence invades your mind, and
seems to speak in Roulean. &quot;You are foolish to come here, outlander. This is the
castle called Chalicmere, fortress of the Latzimestal faction...&quot; <br>
----&quot;Ah, but such subteties are beyond you. To your barbarian eye, we are merely
corpses and bones, all alike and monstrous. Yet it is not so, and these rotting forms you
revile shaped the destinies of men and kingdoms far beyond your ken.&quot; <br>
----&quot;Obstruct me not, whelp. I have urgent traffic with the Lords of the
Latzimestal..., Unless you will give me a note worth 10,000 pyreal. Then I shale grant you
all the adventure you desire, if you be mighty enough to use my passage. Yet I shale not
suffer barbarians in my home, and will prevent you from conjuring the gate yourself.&quot;
</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">When you hand the Emissary a C note, he
then gives you this message and summons a portal to the drop point on Aerlinthe (84.1n
47.2e). See the &quot;Aerlinthe Map&quot; in the menu.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----&quot;The voice in your mind
sneers, &quot;You are wise to offer me such a boon, lest I strike ye down like the cur in
the street. I shale open the path to my home, the ancient port of Aerlinthe. You would be
wise to tread lightly, lest you wake the ire of my island my Lady.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">A similar situation with the other Emissary
in the South Dires, <a href="emissary1.jpg"><strong>Garaena
the Emissary</strong></a>,&nbsp; except her fee is 50k. When you speak to her, you see
this message:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The rotting woman inclines her head
stiffly, and a disembodied voice seeps across your mind like oil. &quot;Child, you walk
among the tombs of the Sand Kings. Long ago they were mighty captains in service to the
powers behind the Ice Throne. Now they rest, and dream of new plots. Yet still they hold
themselves great power, and are ageless and fey.&quot; <br>
----&quot;My mistress sent me hither to solicit their aid in a great cause. Perhaps you
could serve, for I shall call the enemy of mine enemy friend. Those in shadow...thralls of
the one called Slayer of Hope...beset our isle. If you give me a note worth 50,000 of the
Yalaini pyreal, to fund my mission to bribe the Sand Kings, I shall open the gate for you.
<br>
----&quot;Be warned; only the mightiest may pass through this gate, and I will not allow
you to tie to it.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">When you hand her the trade note you hear
this message right before she summons a portal to the same drop point on <strong>Aerlinthe</strong>
as <strong>Faladha</strong>'s portal:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The voice in your mind purrs,
&quot;Ai, this will serve. Seek the dark ones and destroy them...yet meddle not with the
devices on the island of Aerlinthe. Perilous they are to those who do not understand their

a &quot;<strong>charred book</strong>&quot; was found. The book was translated into the

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Refer to entry <strong>RE 886</strong> in
the record, you find that <strong>Ejan</strong> was the second governor of <strong>Aerlinthe</strong>

you will come across <strong><a href="ejan.jpg">Smith

on it. The note gets translated into &quot;<a

in <strong>Cragstone</strong>. The note is as follows:</font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#smithnote">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">From: Ejan Aralea, Master Smith of
Aerlinthe </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">To: Shaura Lemaih, Master Smith of Ireth
Lassel </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">- </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Greetings, old friend. May this find you
well. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">I have sent this messenger to you to
inquire if you might have a certain spare part for the forging mechanisms in your
possession. Tenkarrdun has been grumbley lately. You've probably heard, as I've heard that
your Seral Ipharsis (Translator's note: literally,&quot;Great Crown Besnowed&quot;)
remains quiescent. Lucky woman! The mountains here may be hotter and more efficient
forges, but they move with unsettling ease. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I fear we've had more pieces of the
forges be crushed or melted by fresh flows in the last few days. Specifically, I need a
new set of bellows for the upper forging mechanism, up here in the caldera of Tenkarrdun.
If you think that's bad, I also have to get a golem to replace the bars on one of the
lower magma sluices. Hard to get at, those are - we'll actually have to send it through
our reservoir and into a thermal fumarole at its bottom! Fortunately, we have a couple of
those bars stashed away in our storerooms here. We'll have to fix that before we can get
to work on the forge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">I would normally send to Knorr for the
bellows, but, well... Lord Asheron appears to have sealed the portals as his end. It's
anyone's guess why. Some problem with his students, mayhaps. At any rate, I apologize for
needing to plead poverty to you, Shaura. As soon as Knorr is open to travel once more, I
will request replacement of your bellows. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Walk with light upon your shoulders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Ejan </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; The above note is the hint or lead
that begins the quest. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><i>- </i>This entry in the
<strong>Record</strong> describes in part some of what <strong>Ejan</strong> was saying in
the note about the problems at the forge: </font></p>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><i>TE 463: Massive
collapse of the Tenkarrdun forge tunnels during a landquake. Four workers are crushed,
another sixteen trapped and suffocated. The entire lower quarter of the foundry is cut
off. Shifting rock makes reopening the tunnels too risky, and Ejan decides to build a new
forge works further up the mountain. </i></font></p>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><i>- </i>The very last
entry in the Record also describes what <strong>Ejan</strong> was referring to in the
note: </font></p>

<p><font class="BaseFont" face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><i>HE 459: Severe
landquakes cause magma flows in the upper forge tunnels. Smiths remove to the port while
golems effect repairs. </i></font></p>
</a><a NAME="#first1">

<p></a><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">In the note <strong>Ejan</strong>
mentions that before he can work on the forge he needs to have a golem replace a bar on
one of the lower magma sluices. (sluice: n. an artificial waterway with agate or other
device to control the flow and level of the water). He mentions that he has some of these
bars stored away in his storerooms. So that is our first goal... retrieve the &quot;<strong><a
href="gatebar.jpg">Sluice Gate Bar</a></strong>&quot;. </font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#first2">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The &quot;</a><strong><a
href="gatebar.jpg">Sluice Gate Bar</a></strong>&quot; is
found in a lower section of the &quot;<strong><a
href="tenkarrdum.htm">Tenkarrdum Foundry</a></strong>&quot;
dungeon (88.9n 42.7e). I don't have any maps done of the upper part of this dungeon yet,
only the lower section.&nbsp; The bar is in the <strong><a href="barroom.jpg">forge room</a></strong> on level
4 that has a number of the same ovens that were at the <strong>Crater</strong> and a
lever.&nbsp;Check the <strong><a href="tenkarrdum.htm">map</a></strong>
for details.</font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#first3">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Now that you have the &quot;</a><strong><a
href="gatebar.jpg">Sluice Gate Bar</a></strong>&quot; you
need to take it to the <strong>Repair Golem NPC</strong> in the &quot;<strong><a
href="res.htm">Aerlinthe Reservoir Dungeon</a></strong>&quot;.
(85.5n 43.4e). The Golem is deep in the bowels of the <strong>Reservoir</strong>. The
dungeon is split into 2 parts, the second being '<a href="#oldring"><strong>The Old Ring</strong></a>&quot;
section which is where you will find the Golem. Following this <strong><a
href="res.htm">partial map</a></strong> to get to the <strong>Olthoi
Section</strong>, then using <strong><a href="res2.htm">Nodokas
maps</a></strong> of the Olthoi section, you will be able to reach the portal to the
&quot;<strong>Old Ring</strong>&quot; section. The jumps indicated in my top floor Res map
lead to the second floor of the Olthoi section, where you see Nodoka has indicated an
entrance. You should be able to follow his maps down to the portal at the bottom of the
5th floor of the Olthoi section. In a pit on the 5th floor is a second <strong>Aerlinthe
Reservoir Portal</strong> but it doesn't take you back to the beginning like you would
think it does, instead it drops you into the <strong>Old Ring</strong> section. Using the
maps, you should be able to make your way to the jump in the west end of the ring
section.. You need to be careful that you jump on an angle that will land you on the <strong><a
href="pitjump.jpg">safety gate</a></strong> or else you
will fall deep into the magma pit and either die from the heat dmg, or get mauled by the
golems down there. If you make the jump, you will see the <strong>Repair Golem</strong>.
It looks like a regular magma golem. You hand it the &quot;<strong><a
href="gatebar.jpg">Sluice Gate Bar</a></strong>&quot; and
<strong><a href="repair.jpg">this message is broadcast</a></strong>
to anyone in the area. <em><strong>&quot;The golem turns and fuses the bar into the Sluice
Gate. Somewhere below, you hear a grinding vibration through the ground... The fires of
Tenkarrdun have been redirected the the ancient Yalaini Forges.&quot;</strong> . </em>Once
this message is broadcast, the golem crumbles to the ground and disappears, thus
completing this stage of the quest.</font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#second1">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Ok, now onto the next objective. </a><a
NAME="#smithnote">In the note he mentions a <strong>bellows</strong>.</a> <em>&quot;<strong>...Specifically,

of the oven/forge looking things</a></strong>. </font></p>

<a NAME="#second2">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">After you retrieve the bellows, you head
back over the &quot;</a><strong><a href="tenkarrdum.htm">Tenkkardum
Foundry</a></strong>&quot;. &nbsp;The forges you need to get to are below the storeroom
level. To get into that area takes a bit of a trick. The door is opened by a lever on
level 3 in the elevated dome room. You need to assign someone in your team to wait up
there and hit the lever when you are all at the door ready to go in. Once you work your
way down to the forge, you'll see the walls are lined with more of the ovens found in the <strong>Crater</strong>
and in the Storeroom of the <strong>Foundry</strong>. In the back of the room you'll find
the <strong>Smithing Golem</strong>. You hand him the &quot;<strong><a
href="bellows.jpg">Pyreal Forge Bellows</a></strong>&quot;
and a <strong><a href="smithgolem.jpg">server wide
message</a></strong> is broadcast. <em>&quot;<strong>The ground trembles beneath you!
Mount Tenkarrdum has become active once again! On Dereth, the volcanoes echo the eruption
on far Aerlinthe Island.&quot;</strong>. </em>After this message is broadcast, the golem
crumbles to the ground then disappears, and the forge begins to fill up with lava. This
completes the next stage of the quest.</font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#behemoth">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Next up is the &quot;</font></a><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong><a href="behemoth.jpg">Behemoth
of Tenkarrdum</a></strong>&quot;
Battle. There was no in-game hint about this aside from the volcano erupting. Since nobody
&nbsp; knew what to do after the <a href="smithgolem.jpg"><strong>server
wide message</strong></a>, the only option was to search the whole island to see what had
changed. The first thing that was apparent was the population of Hellfires and Plasmas in
the <strong>caldera of Tenkarrdum</strong> had increased. Upon deeper exploration of the
caldera, the <strong><a href="behemoth.jpg">Behemoth
of Tenkarrdum</a></strong> was uncovered. It was nearly in the very center of the volcano
surrounded by an army of <strong><a href="hellfire.jpg">Hellfires</a></strong>,
Plasma Golems, Magma Golems, Firestorms, Fire Wisps, Embers... all kinds of ugliness. Also
found was a <a href="vent.gif"><strong>large air vent</strong></a>
spewing mist high into the air. You can see a scale comparison <strong><a
href="comparison.jpg">here</a></strong>.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Behemoth</strong> resembled an oversized magma golem and seemed to be 100%
resistant to War magic. Almost every initial attempt to attack <strong>Behemoth</strong>
near his spawn point failed. A combination of lag due to the insane amount of monsters in
the area and coupled with he amount of dmg they can inflict made the idea of killing this
creature at his spawn point impossible. To give you an idea of what you are up against, a
Hellfire is the top of the Fire Elemental food chain. If you take an Inferno and double
it, you have a Firestorm. Take a Firestorm and double it you have a Hellfire. Plamsa
Golems are the top of the Golem food chain it seems. I think it's safe to assume they are
about double a diamond golem in terms of difficulty. They attack with lightning/bludgeon
damage. White Pynthos Wasps attack with cold damage. Think Gold Wasp, then double that and
you have your White Pynthos Wasp. Now, add into the mix the flares, embers, flammas, all
the little fire elemental guys... easy to kill but there's a bunch so that added to the
lag.&nbsp; And that should give you a pretty good idea of what the <strong>Tenkarrdum
caldera</strong> used to be like. Since the initial attacks, the particle effect on the
fire elementals was reduced making the lag alot more bearable. Now questers are able to
single out and destroy the Behemoth relativley quickly if they are well organised. (Tip:
When you arrive to your striking point, most people have thier team log out. This make's
all mobs who were trailing you as you entered the caldera break pursuit and return to
spawn. This will reduce any unneccesary lag and make the attack on Behemoth alot easier.)<br>
<br>
The initial idea was to lure it out of the center there somehow. Eventually 'safe spots'
were found, which weren't very safe but were not as dangerous as the rest. If you could
lure the <strong>Behemoth</strong> to one of these spots... and keep it there killing all
the other things that might tag along... enough so that you have the <strong>Behemoth</strong>
alone, then you have the chance to kill it. this tactic remined the same for the most part
up till now, with the exception of the log out trick which eliminates the need to kill
straggler mobs. When you defeat the <strong>Behemoth</strong>, an area wide message would
be broadcast. <strong><em>&quot;The Behemoth roars at the sky, perhaps cursing it's
opponent </em>*</strong>insert name of player who inflicted the most damage here<strong>*<em>,
then explodes into an enormous pile of flaming rubble.&quot;</strong>. </em>On the corpse,
a &quot;<strong><a href="boulder.jpg">Black Boulder</a></strong>&quot;
was found.</font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#boulder">

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The &quot;</a><strong><a
href="boulder.jpg">Black Boulder</a></strong>&quot; is
the reward for getting to this point in the quest. Based on speculation that it is similar
to the &quot;<strong>Black Rock</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Black Stone</strong>&quot;
, the Boulder was turned into a <strong>Stone Collector</strong>. The collector gave back
the &quot;<strong><a href="stone.jpg">Black Fire Atlan
Stone</a></strong>&quot; which could be inserted in your existing <strong>Atlan weapons</strong>
similar to any of the <strong>Elemental Stones</strong>. The stone enchants the weapon
with these spells: Weapon Mastery Other 4, Blood Drinker 6, Swift Killer 4, Cold
Protection Other 4, and Curse Of Black Fire. The Curse is a -50 to your Magic Defense.
Difficulty is 180 and your skill in that weapon must be 250+ to operate the magic. <strong><a href="StaffofBF_Stats.JPG">Click here</a></strong> for a pic of

<hr>
<a NAME="#story">

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">At this point, questers were not sure what to do
next. Then a summary of the events was scribed which had a passage related to the island.
From &quot;The Story Thus Far&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em><small>The biggest news of the month was the
discovery of a passage to a heretofore-unknown island. A pair of undead heralds arrived in
the Direlands, one in the northeast at the undead fortress of Chalicmere, and the other in
the southeast, at a trio of sandy old crypts. In exchange for huge sums of money, these
emissaries would cast a portal to the island of Aerlinthe, lying to the northeast of
Dereth. </small></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em><small>Aerlinthe was an intensely volcanic
island, with several peaks ringing a central lagoon. It seemed, in fact, that the island's
nature had been the death of its original population long ago; a ruined port was
discovered along the southeast shore, its inhabitants frozen into positions of horror by
falling ash. Many fossilized undead skeletons still wandered the island, as did a host of
bizarre new creatures. Coral golems lined the navigation channel into the lagoon. Tenuous
vapor and plasma golems roamed the calderas of the volcanoes and the underground. </small></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em><small>Intrepid adventurers, following
instructions found on the bones of an undead Empyrean smith, managed to restart the old
forge mechanisms built into the central mountain of Tenkarrdun. With a rumble that could
be heard as far away as Ayan Baqur, the volcano came to life. Plumes of magma and a hoard
of powerful blue-white fire elementals issued forth from the caldera of great Tenkarrdun.
Those who visited the steaming crater found themselves overwhelmed and driven back. </small></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em><small>However, the sighting of a great beast
brought them back for more. The &#147;Behemoth of Tenkarrdun,&#148; a huge and powerful
(though stupid) magma golem, had crawled up from the depths of the mountain to blister and
squash all who dared approach its home. It was, eventually, overwhelmed and killed. Some
say a mere duo managed to slay it, others insist that it took an assault of nearly a
hundred to bring it down. </small></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><em><small>Unfortunately, Aerlinthe has managed to
keep its remaining secrets for the time being. As Leafdawning drew to a close, <strong>the
bulk of the invading force of fire elementals still held the caldera of Mount Tenkarrdun.
While many searched unsuccessfully for some obscure, hidden method to end their reign, few
seemed willing to directly challenge them in open combat</strong>. Perhaps this was due to
the fierce conditions in the crater, or perhaps because what commanded the occupying
forces could not easily be discerned. </small></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Based on the parts that are in bold print, questers
decided to plan another large scale assualt on the fire elementals in the caldera at
Tenkarrdun. </font></p>

<hr>
</a><a NAME="#inv1">

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">A direct assault proved to be the key, as the forces
attacked the fire elementals head on, eventually killing the one who was controlling them.
This elusive Hellfire was hiding amongst the others, and has no distinguishable features
to set him out from the rest. (Initially it was 2 levels higher than the rest, so it was
easier to pick out, but that changed with the following prop) . Eventually after battling
all the creatures found in the center of the caldera, they managed to find and vanquish
the leader. When it was slain </a><a href="invasion1.jpg"><strong>this
message</strong></a> was broadcast to the area: <em><strong>As</strong></em> *insert name
of player who inflicted most dmg here* <em><strong>smites the Hellfire, the
flame-creatures sigh, and begin to dissapear back into the vents and fumaroles they
surfaced through. But, from the base of the mountains slopes, you hear the whisper of
falling ash, and the clacking of petrified bones... </strong></em><br>
<br>
When the Hellfire was slain, it dropped the <strong>Red Fire Infusion</strong>. </font></p>

<hr>
<a NAME="#inv2">

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Shortly after the invasion was repelled at
Tenkarrdun, reports started coming in about a second invading force that had erupted out
of Mt Espar. The whole caldera there has become infested with infernos, flammas, magma
golems and flares. Somewhere in the middle off all of them stood a lone Firestorm. This
was obviously the figurehead of the invasion. The defending forces targeted firepower on
it and managed to slay it, at which point </a><a
href="invasion2.jpg"><strong>this message</strong></a>
was broadcast to the area: <em><strong>As</strong></em> *insert name of player who
inflicted the most dmg here* <em><strong>smites the Firestorm, the flame-creatures sigh,

<a NAME="#inv3">

<p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The next logical step was to check the remaining
Dereth volcano, Mt Lethe. Lo and behold it was also overrun with fire elementals.

Hellfire was spotted overlooking the action from high up on the volcano wall. Attackers

questers fell back to the message given at the </a><a href="#inv1"><strong>Assualt on
Tenkarrdun</strong></a>, specifically this part: &nbsp; &quot;But, from the base of the
mountains slopes, you hear the whisper of falling ash, and the clacking of petrified
bones... &quot; . Upon searching the island, they discovered that the <a href="town1.jpg"><strong>Abandoned Town</strong></a>
where <a href="ejan.jpg"><strong>Smith Ejan</strong></a>
resides had been overrun by Relic Bones and Firestorms in addition to the usual residents.
As you can see in <a href="invasion4.jpg"><strong>this
pic</strong></a>, the town was packed with an obscene amount of invaders, just look at the
radar. A vicous battle for control of the town took place, and eventually, like the other
3 invasions, a single non-unique Relic Bone was found to be the leader and slain at which
point this message was broadcast to the area: </font><font class="BaseMsgFont"

Surely it will not last long! <br>

a magic ring that casts Deception Mastery 4 and Person Attunement 4. <br>

The portal the Relic Bone summoned while trying to retreat leads to <strong>Aerfalle Keep</strong>.

place. </a><a href="ladyaerfalle.jpg"><strong>Lady
Aerfalle</strong></a> seems to be a scientist of sorts running some kind of labratory. The
Keep itself is full of alot of eye candy, like the lab room with the <a

the study with the <a href="ostatues.jpg"><strong>olthoi
statues</strong></a>, where you can also see a <a

above a pit of lava</strong></a>, almost as if they were cooking. Also, there is a
oversized <a href="umbris.jpg"><strong>Umbris Shadow</strong></a>
in what resembles a prison cell. It does not attack, can't be spoken to or given anything.
It's purpose is yet to be revealed. Deep within the bowels of the keep, the questers found
<a href="ladyaerfalle.jpg"><strong>Lady Aerfalle</strong></a>
herself, donning a stunning black robe. They managed to defeat her, and on her remains
they found the <a href="StaffStats.jpg"><strong>Staff of
Aerfalle</strong></a>, <strong>Aerfalles Letter</strong> and a key. They key opens the <a

they found upstairs. The chest harboured a whole treasure chest full of items, including
both the coveted<b> <a href="pallium.jpg">Aerfalle's Pallium</a>

and a complete surprise in Leikotho's sword <a href="ashbane.jpg"><b>&quot;Ashbane&quot;</b></a>. The letter
