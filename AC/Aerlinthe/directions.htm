<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">You can only gain access to Aerlinthe
island via&nbsp;the two Emissaries that have been dispatched to Dereth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><a
href="http://ww.thejackcat.com/AC/Aerlinthe/emissary2.jpg"><strong>Faladha the Emissary</strong></a>
at&nbsp; <strong>Chalicmere Fortress</strong> </font><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"
size="4"><strong>17.7s 57.4w</strong></font><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">
(requires a C note to summon portal)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><a
href="http://ww.thejackcat.com/AC/Aerlinthe/emissary1.jpg"><strong>Garaena the Emissary</strong></a>
at a group of temples in South Dires. <strong>87.6s 65.6w</strong> (requires a D note to
summon portal)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The best way to reach <strong>Chalicmere
Fortress</strong> is as follows: Go to Baishi. Buy a 'sake' from the food vendor there.
Run south to the Drunken Madman's Tower (53.0s 61.0e). Hand the Drunken Madman the 'sake'
and he will summon a portal. Take the portal and you will be at the 'walled portals' fort
in the dires (21.5s 74.5w). You will see 2 other portals here. Take the one labeled
&quot;Accursed Halls&quot;. Now you will be inside another walled fort. This time just
climb the stairs and jump outside the walls. A short run north to 17.7s 57.4w will lead
you to Chalicmere Fortress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">The best way to reach <strong>Garaena</strong>
is as follows: Run to <strong>Sylsfear</strong> dungeon at <strong>11.0n 14.7e. </strong>Inside
you will find a portal to <strong>South Dires </strong>past the shadows section. Take the
portal and you will be dropped at a lifestone in the south dires. If you look south east
you will see the set of 3 bunkers. Garaena is standing to the south of the farthest east
bunker.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Upon entering <strong>Chalicmere Fortress</strong>,
you will see <a href="http://ww.thejackcat.com/AC/Aerlinthe/emissary2.jpg"><strong>Faladha the
Emissary</strong></a> and hear these messages broadcast to the area:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The dead man turns and looks down
the rotted remains of his nose at you. A cool, Aristocatic presence invades your mind, and
seems to speak in Roulean. &quot;You are foolish to come here, outlander. This is the
castle called Chalicmere, fortress of the Latzimestal faction...&quot; <br>
----&quot;Ah, but such subteties are beyond you. To your barbarian eye, we are merely
corpses and bones, all alike and monstrous. Yet it is not so, and these rotting forms you
revile shaped the destinies of men and kingdoms far beyond your ken.&quot; <br>
----&quot;Obstruct me not, whelp. I have urgent traffic with the Lords of the
Latzimestal..., Unless you will give me a note worth 10,000 pyreal. Then I shale grant you
all the adventure you desire, if you be mighty enough to use my passage. Yet I shale not
suffer barbarians in my home, and will prevent you from conjuring the gate yourself.&quot;
</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">When you hand the Emissary a C note, he
then gives you this message and summons a portal to the drop point on Aerlinthe (84.1n
47.2e). See the &quot;Aerlinthe Map&quot; above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----&quot;The voice in your mind
sneers, &quot;You are wise to offer me such a boon, lest I strike ye down like the cur in
the street. I shale open the path to my home, the ancient port of Aerlinthe. You would be
wise to tread lightly, lest you wake the ire of my island my Lady.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">A similar situation with the other Emissary
in the South Dires, with <a href="http://ww.thejackcat.com/AC/Aerlinthe/emissary1.jpg"><strong>Garaena
the Emissary</strong></a> except her fee is 50k. When you speak to her, you see this
message:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The rotting woman inclines her head
stiffly, and a disembodied voice seeps across your mind like oil. &quot;Child, you walk
among the tombs of the Sand Kings. Long ago they were mighty captains in service to the
powers behind the Ice Throne. Now they rest, and dream of new plots. Yet still they hold
themselves great power, and are ageless and fey.&quot; <br>
----&quot;My mistress sent me hither to solicit their aid in a great cause. Perhaps you
could serve, for I shall call the enemy of mine enemy friend. Those in shadow...thralls of
the one called Slayer of Hope...beset our isle. If you give me a note worth 50,000 of the
Yalaini pyreal, to fund my mission to bribe the Sand Kings, I shall open the gate for you.
<br>
----&quot;Be warned; only the mightiest may pass through this gate, and I will not allow
you to tie to it.&quot; </em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">When you hand her the note you hear this
message right before she summons a portal to the same drop point on <strong>Aerlinthe</strong>
as <strong>Faladha</strong>'s portal:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><em>----The voice in your mind purrs,
&quot;Ai, this will serve. Seek the dark ones and destroy them...yet meddle not with the
devices on the island of Aerlinthe. Perilous they are to those who do not understand their
art.&quot; </em></font></p>
