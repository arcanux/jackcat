    RE: Shall we play a game ? How about a nice game of chess ? </a><br>
    <br>
    Actually, this has nothing to do with Harry Potter. The way some people 
    post, you'd think J.K. Rowling invented Chess. <br>
    <br>
    This addition is the culmination of about 5 years of wishing, hoping and 
    finally doing. <br>
    <br>
    Probably over 5 years ago we wanted to add games to AC. But the sheer amount 
    of coding required made it unfeasible. <br>
    <br>
    So the artists sat around one day coming up with ways to play Chess without 
    extra coding. How could it be done? <br>
    <br>
    Well, the first step was making chess boards and pieces. There are certain 
    Empyrean floor structures on the map that were designed originally as chess 
    boards. I'm not sure if the real chess board was ever added in-game, though. 
    But it has existed in data for years. <br>
    <br>
    The current model, though, is a version I created to work with the current 
    chess system. <br>
    <br>
    So we thought of making chess pieces available at vendors. You could buy a 
    full set and go set up a game on these Empyrean ruined floors and you could 
    manually play a game. <br>
    <br>
    But it was completely griefable. There would be nothing stopping someone 
    from taking your pieces. Except burden. We thought if we made them real 
    heavy no one would want to run off with them. <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, when it came down to it, we really needed game code to make it work 
    and we had no programmers available to do any work other than scheduled, 
    needed work. <br>
    <br>
    We never did add the pieces, because there was no point... not if we 
    couldn't make the thing work. <br>
    <br>
    So years go by, and at just about every meeting the question of Chess would 
    come up. <br>
    <br>
    Todd came on board and I think he was here about fourteen milliseconds 
    before he started working on Chess. Planning for it anyway. <br>
    <br>
    Chess was a labor of love for Todd. He worked on it in his spare time. A 
    lot. All the while, making improvements in server code, making requested 
    changes, and just doing his job. Chess was his hobby. <br>
    <br>
    We watched for months as it got better and better. Soon you could actually 
    click on a board and drudges would show up. Later, those drudges moved. All 
    through keyboard commands. <br>
    <br>
    Recently he added the UI, and implemented some of Chess' more subtle, 
    obscure rules. <br>
    <br>
    Then he implemented an actual standard chess ranking system. <br>
    <br>
    And this month, you can finally see it. <br>
    <br>
    Whew! That's all I can say. <br>
    <br>
    Sean. </font></p>
