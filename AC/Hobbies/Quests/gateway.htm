	<font color="#FFFF99">Shuthoth tells you, &quot;Welcome, friend. I seek warriors 
	in search of great adventure. I represent one who would grant the Isparians 
	of the world much power, much knowledge.&quot;<br>
	Shuthoth tells you, &quot;She has found something. Something powerful beneath the 
	waves of this world. A city, ancient and doomed. The blue-skinned King did 
	his part to raise it from the deep, but I daresay he could not have done it 
	alone.&quot;<br>
	Shuthoth tells you, &quot;Now that the island exists, the lady would ask Dereth's 
	hunters and adventurers to explore its mysteries.&quot;<br>
	Shuthoth tells you, &quot;If you seek such a challenge, I bid you take this gem 
	and place it within the empty eye of one of Aerlinthe's Watchers. The 
	Watchers will tell you what else you must do.&quot;<br>
	Shuthoth tells you, &quot;You have the spark of adventure within you. Good luck,

	<p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Use fire or slash on the Doomed 
Spirits, slash on the Wisps, fire on the Bone Scourge, slash or lightning rend 
on the Virulence, and fire on the Mu-Miyah.<br>
<br>
There are Lighting, Flame and Acid traps. These do not vuln, but shoot wall 
spells. None are deadly in their own right, but bear them in mind when running 
or moving when hp is low. Try to stay healed up at all times in here as the 
Doomed Spirits can hurt when you are blade vulned and two or three of them 
decide to practice the art of war magic on you.<br>
<br>
Basic directions are as follows:<br>
<br>
Take a left turn wherever possible, at first you will be heading down ramps then 
begin to head up again towards the end. As you progress through the dungeon you 
will come across several open rooms, one has no visible floor and if you look 
down you will see lava, just run straight across the room to the door at the 
other side, stay in the middle of the room as you run.<br>
<br>
How do you know when you are at the final room?<br>
<br>
You'll head up a ramp and enter a room with several exits right and left side, 
there is a wooden ramp in the top right corner of the room (as you enter).<br>
<br>
There are many Doomed Spirits in the halls exiting left and right from this 
room, there is no need to fight them.<br>
<br>
What you do at this point depends if you are solo or the size and strength of 
your party. <br>
<br>
If you are solo, I recommend that you run straight across the room, up the ramp, 
head left and keep running till you hit the door with the exit portal behind it, 
open the door and run through the portal. <br>
<br>
Running is probably your best bet if your group is small and you don't fancy a 
big battle with the creatures ahead, stagger the run if you do this, so go a 
minute or so apart to let the creatures settle or the subsequent runners could 
get stuck and die.<br>
<br>
There are a LOT of creatures in the room, if you try to run it with a group it 
is likely that someone will get stuck and die near the door.<br>
<br>
Your decision, run or fight.<br>
<br>
If you fight the best strategy is to run up the wooden ramp and get against the 
wall on your right side. (stay away from the ramp and edge then any Doomed 
Spirits below can not shoot you with war)<br>
<br>
Have any missile chars or mages in your group take out the Entropy wisps and 
Spirits that are shooting at you. Melees focus on the Mummys and Bone Scourges 
(do not run up the room to them, let them come to you), the Mummys have a LOT of 
health and some of the Bones carry shields, so once the 'Magic casters' have 
been dealt with, mages swap to imperiling then blasting the mummys and bones. 
Re-spawn on the magic casters is fast, so unless your group is large or strong 
enough to clear the mummys quickly, be prepared for another round of incoming 
war spells. Mages and missile chars deal with any casters as they appear.<br>
<br>
Once you have cleared the spawn head towards the portal, kill anything that 
appears on the way, then open door and all exit.<br>
<br>
You are now standing on a mountain ledge with four Crystal NPCs. It is very 
important that you interact with the Crystals one at a time. Form a line and 
don't talk to or attempt to interact with a Crystal until the person in front 
has been portalled.</font></span></p>

Shemza is the first crystal that you need to talk to.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font size="2" face="arial">
<font color="#FFFF99">Shemza tells you, &quot;A warrior! A warrior comes! Brothers, feast your eyes on one 
who would give their lives willingly to the great lord!&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Shemza tells you, &quot;You seek to bask in the glory of Grael, 
do you not? You seek to join us in the worship of he who is more powerful, more 
glorious, than all who have come before? My brothers and I, we were the first to 
join his side. We were there when he led us to victory over the old ones. We 
helped him slay the mages and lay waste to their cities. We were there when he 
led an army upon the heretics of the light.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shemza tells you, &quot;When defeat fell upon us, we knew that our ascendance was 
only delayed. One day, we knew that our god would rise from the depths and claim 
that which is his. And we knew that ones such as you would seek to free him from 
his chains.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shemza tells you, &quot;And now you are here. You seek to barter with us who have 
given our souls in exchange for life eternal. Those of us who have lengthened 
our lives for the sole purpose of delivering warriors unto him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shemza tells you, &quot;Yes. You are here now. And now you will aid me. And then you 
will aid my brothers.&quot;<br>
Shemza tells you, &quot;I seek a boon. One small boon. The masters of the portal 
carry a token of golden hue. A token that I would claim as mine own. Find it and 
deliver it to me. Then the first part of your quest shall begin.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shemza tells you, &quot;I have altered your body. You may now use our portal near 
Ayan Baqur.&quot;</font></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
Once Shemza has finished talking to you, give him the Yellow Virindi Gem, you 
will be portalled into dungeon 2.</font></span></p>

<font face="arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give Shemza Yellow Jewel.</font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>

<br>
Once everyone has portalled in, head straight ahead and begin to descend down 
the ramps. There are Entropy Wisps at the beginning and then Doomed Spirits.<br>
<br>
I recommend killing everything if you are in a group. If solo you can run this 
section (I've done it); if you decide to fight, then you will need to be strong 
enough to handle 3 or more Doomed Spirits at a time.<br>
<br>
Once you hit the section with the Doomed Spirits you will see passages leading 
off in all directions, at the bottom of the central passages are doors; at the 
bottom of the eastmost and westmost passages are rooms with torches on the 
walls.<br>
<br>
The idea here is to get one of the doors open by using a torch. One of the doors 
is a false, one which does not need a torch to open (behind the door is an 
unlocked steel chest).<br>
<br>
If you're solo, find a room with a torch, hit it, then run back up and check 
each door in turn to find the one you opened. If with a group, place the group 
at the top of the passages, hit the torch and get one of the group to check each 
passage in turn to find the open door Get them to block it and call everyone 
down and in, keeping it blocked as you run back .<br>
<br>
Once you are through this door, you will notice you are in a room with a pit. 
There is an unlocked Black Marrow Reliquary in here. If you are careful, you can 
hop over and take turns looting it. If anyone falls, then I recommend the group 
jump down to assist them.<br>
<br>
When you are done with the Reliquary, Imperil all the Spirits below, jump down 
and kill them all. Take any exit from the pit and take all left turns, head up 
any ramps you find. You will soon come across the Radiant Crystal. There are 
Doomed spirits in the room with it. If you are solo (mage or archer), you can 
shoot the crystal and if lucky only need to kill the odd spirit that manages to 
get to you. yYu may find that they all come.<br>
<br>
Archer can 'rail gun' the crystal (it has no missile defense). Once the crystal 
is dead, everyone loot a Radiant Shard. I am unsure how many shards it drops, 
certainly more than 5, but in any event re-spawn on the crystal is fast if you 
need more shards.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Timer: 24 hours<br>
<br>
Once everyone has their shard, take the exit portal. You are back on the 
mountain ledge, this time talk to Lurza.<br>
<br>
Lurza will ask for the Radiant shard, give him the shard, Lurza will then ask 
for a key, give him the Sezzherei's Lair Gem.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font face="arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Lurza tells you, &quot;You must bring to 
me a shard of the Radiant Crystal. Only when Shemza sings your name to the lord 
of the deep will you gain access to that Crystal.&quot;</font></p><align="left">
	<p>
<font face="arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give Lurza Radiant Shard.<br>
</font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Lurza tells you, &quot;Long have 
we waited, trapped within these crystalline forms, waiting for those who would 
join him in his quest. And now you come. You come seeking our approval. But are 
you worthy?&quot;<br>
Lurza tells you, &quot;There is something I seek. The key to one who once followed 
our cause. A traitor who makes his home among the winged demons of the dark. 
Bring the key to this fallen lord, and I will grant you passage.&quot;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><span lang="en-us">You give 
Lurza Sezzherei's Lair Gem.</span></font><font face="arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lurza tells you, &quot;The demon Sezzherei once called himself our brother. But when 
he betrayed our lord to the ancient mages, he fell from Grael's favor. Our 
brother Tursh slew Sezzherei on the battlefield, or so we all believed. Now he 
claims the dark as his master, and seeks to appease its twisted whims.&quot;<br>
Lurza tells you, &quot;Sezzherei will once again know the taste of his own blood. 
When Grael rises and marches across this land, Sezzherei will kneel once again.&quot;<br>
Lurza tells you, &quot;Now find the Dazzling shard, and give it to my brother Dmesne.&quot;</font><font face="arial" size="2"><br>

<br>
Once everyone is in, head through the dungeon taking left turns wherever 
possible. You'll come to a room with a pit; jump down.<br>
<br>
The dungeon textures change and you will now encounter Diseased Phyntos Wasps. 
Kill these as you work through the corridors (taking all lefts as you go).<br>
<br>
You'll soon come to another pit, make sure you are fully baned and protected for 
acid damage and jump down.<br>
<br>
You'll find yourself in a mazelike set of rooms with acid as the floor, the acid 
will damage you regularly for small amounts. There are Virulence in the rooms 
which can cast Acid vuln on you; watch out for that.<br>
<br>
Make your way through the rooms, taking all left turns. Kill everything as you 
go. It makes the last part a little easier. You'll come to a room which you 
access via a narrow passageway. There you will meet some more Wasps and can see 
the Dazzling Crystal in front and above you.<br>
<br>
Once you have killed all the spawn, place yourself a few paces in front of the 
doorway you came through and make a full jump up and onto a grated floor in 
front of you. (If you play around with your camera angles you can see the 
grate.)<br>
<br>
From the grate jump up either left or right. Don't jump up towards the crystal 
or you may overshoot and hit the exit portal.<br>
<br>
Kill the Crystal and make sure everyone loots a shard, then take the exit 
portal. You are back on the mountain ledge, this time talk to Dmesne.</font></span></p>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">NPC:
<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21554.html">The Flame Guardian</a> 
- 38.6N, 65.8W<br>
<br>
I recommend everyone using the Lifestone here. If you die, you can get back by 
portal recalling and talking to Rhujun again, but it's safer to LS.<br>
<br>
Talk to the Flame Guardian who will instruct you to destroy the Spirits of Water 
laying claim to the Island.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font size="2" face="arial">
<font color="#FFFF99">Flame Guardian tells you, &quot;Welcome to my lonely isle, 
little one. You seek the mysteries of Vissidal, do you not? Many have come 
before you. Many will follow in your footsteps. The power which once lay dormant 
beneath the waves has surfaced. I fear the new rulers of this world will regret 
their meddling before all is done.&quot;Flame Guardian tells you, &quot;You seek a boon 
from me, do you not? You seek my permission to further your quest?&quot;&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Flame Guardian tells you, &quot;You must prove yourself, little 
one. You must bathe in the cleansing waters of the deep. You must destroy the 
spirits of Water that lay claim to this isle.&quot;&quot;</font></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
You then need to make sure everyone kills 5
<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21551.html">Water Golems</a> 
each. You get a message each time you kill one, so it's easy to keep count. It's 
a good idea for the stronger members of the group to imperil/vuln and heal the 
weaker members. These golems aren't that tough, but cast a lot of vulns and wars 
and can kill the unwary very quickly.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font size="2" face="arial"><font color="#66FF99">You have killed 1 Water Golems! You must kill 5 to complete your task.<br>

<br>
</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Once everyone has killed 
their 5 golems then talk to the Flame Guardian again, you will be portalled into 
a dungeon that is the mirror image of the Abandoned Mines Subway.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<font color="#FFFF99"><align="left">
<font size="2" face="arial">Flame Guardian tells you, &quot;The waters of the deep cover 
your flesh. You have been cleansed. I sense the spirit of Grael about you. I 
deem you worthy, little one.&quot;</font></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
Your task in here is to find and kill
<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21555.html">Bur Lizk</a>. Make 
your way through the dungeon just as if you were heading through subway to the 
jump down to the portals. Kill the monsters on the way if you want to.<br>
<br>
Once you reach the jump, make sure the party waits until Bur Lizk has been 
Imperilled and festered, DO NOT VULN her. She seems to be like the Burun Kings. 
Vuln her and you will do less damage. Imperil seems to help.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21580.html">
Undead Minions</a> who will cast a ton of debuffs on you.<br>
<br>
Killing strategy for Bur Lizk: If you solo, debuff her, use a rend wand if mage 
(I didnt find a lot of difference between damage types), jump down and run 
north. Lure her into an alcove and kill any Undead Minions that followed you in, 
then take out Bur Lizk.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font size="2" face="arial"><font color="#66FF99">Bur Lizk suffers a frozen fate!</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Bur Lizk smiles as her body falls to the ground. She looks 
briefly to the center of the room, then closes her eyes.</font></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
I've soloed her as an Archer and a mage, the Archer did great damage with a 
frost rend bow and when she was imperilled, killed her very fast. She casts a 
lot of debuffs and is drain happy.<br>
<br>
If you have a strong group, everyone can jump and get stuck in. Make sure you 
imperil the Undeads before jumping; they are pretty weak and die fast (fire 
works great on these).<br>
<br>
Once Bur Lizk dies, a portal will spawn in the centre of the room. Make sure 
everyone takes it<br>
<br>
You are now on an Island with a Lifestone and The Water Guardian.</font></span></p>

<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21585.html">The Water Guardian</a> 
- 94.1S, 77.9W<br>
<br>
I recommend everyone using the Lifestone here. If you die, you can only get back 
by redoing the last dungeon (which means killing Bur Lizk again).<br>
<br>
Talk to the Water Guardian who tells you to slay the spirits of the flame. This 
is the same as the last Island except you need to kill 5
<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=21556.html">Fire Golems</a> each. 
Once again I recommend the stronger members of any group helping the weaker 
ones.</font></span></p>
	<p>
<align="left">
<font color="#FFFF99" size="2" face="arial">Water Guardian tells you, &quot;You have done much to reach 
this point. You have appeased the Gatekeepers. You have been bathed in the 
waters of the Deep. You have bested the warrior Bur Lizk. And now you seek my 
blessing.&quot;<br>
Water Guardian tells you, &quot;As you were bathed in the waters of the deep, now 
must you be cleansed by its fires. Slay the spirits of Flame. Bask in their 
glory.&quot;</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
Once you have all killed 5 golems, talk to the Water Guardian again. The Water 
Guardian will give you a Watery Token and Portal you to the Watcher of The Deep
