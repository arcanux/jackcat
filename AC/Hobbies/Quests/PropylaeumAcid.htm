      hot. A few <a href="../../Pets/olthoi.htm">Olthoi</a> 
      Nobles greet your arrival. In the first section you'll also encounter 
      Evicerators. Buff for Acid, Piercing and Bludgeoning, and also bane your 
      undies. The beginning section is similar to the easier Fire &amp; Ice 
      dungeons. You'll take the first right from the entry and head down the 
      ramp. Fight your way through the Olthoi until you reach the edge of the 
      acid pit. Shift jump down from the east side of the pit (facing west) and 
      immediately head for the west wall to get yourself out of the acid as fast 
      as possible. When you've cleared the area of Olthoi, go down to the end of 
      the hall and retrieve a Hammer of Acid from the green chest (30 day timer).</span></font><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After everyone has a 
      Hammer, take the south passage and head down the spiral staircases. Rebuff 
      at the top of the 2nd set of staircases before heading down to the portal 
      area. It's full of Olthoi. When 
      you reach the room with the two portals, you'll need to split into an 
      upper (bracelet) and a lower (prism) group. Each side will pull a series

      4 way intersection. Head up another ramp and you'll see your next door 
      (Dc). You'll now be in another large room with golems and elementals. Take 
      the north passage and pull the lever for the lowers (L2). </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, head back to the 
      large room and take the west passage and head down a spiral staircase

      hexagonal room. The 
      next lever (L3) is in at the end of a passage on the south side of the

      lever (L3). Head back to the hallway and go north to the split. Make a 
      left heading west and you'll be in an open room. Take the north passage 
      down and around a corner. Continue west and south (ignore the side
