    <p><span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="arial">As soon as the worlds came up I trucked 
    out to the Lugian Fortess and started the quest for the Arm, Mind, Heart. 
    There are now 2 portals outside of the fortress; the old one still takes you 
    inside the catacombs and there is a new one just down the valley that will 
    take you right into the courtyard of the fortress. Of course what skilled 
    warrior wouldn't like the challenge of fighting their way to the end.<br>
    <br>
    At the end you find the Lugian Commander is already there and waiting for 
    you, with no need to go and talk to Auritus for the book and to start the 
    quest. The commander will drop the Berk, as far as I know at 100% every 
    time. No need to do this 5-6 times just to get it anymore. <br>
    <br>
    After that you can begin investigating the 3 camp sites. The coords are 
    still the same but the Master's are there without having to wait for them to 
    spawn. Didn't stick around to see the times on them, sorry. The drop rate on 
    the Mace, Shield and Pauldren are at 100%, unless this is a but they messed 
    up on. <br>
    <br>
    If you still have and use the old versions of the Arm, Mind, and Heart you 
    can also just simply turn those items into Auritus and he will upgrade them 
    for you, no charge. Or you can enjoy the whole quest and go get the new ones 
    and keep the old versions to show that you are that darn old. <br>
    <br>
    Solo fistblade of HG reports that if you fail when imbuing using Calm 
    Strength, etc., you will not destroy the item and you no longer have to wait 
    to try again. He also notes, &quot;Also, it isn't possible to imbue the spear w\o 
    it's being trained, but the sleeves (axe skill check) can be imbued even if 
    it's untrained... *shrug*.&quot;</font></span></p>

    updated report: &quot;The Arm, Mind, Heart quest is truely streamlined like 
    Turbine said now.<br>
    <br>
    I ran over to the master of the hunt(First Spawn) today, and it seems as 
    though, instead of having to run through the quest a bunch of times to get 
    the items you want...the master is on about a 5 minute spawn. Before you'd 
    only get to kill 1 master of the hunt per quest. Great update! Now everyone 
    can enjoy the idea of not having to get their quest jumped :P&quot;</font></span></p>

    encampments into this report. You may find it useful in retrieving our 
    totems. Kifandel the Imbuer now carries the Book of the Arm, Mind, and 
    Heart, which records the words of Lauriagne, our first Matriarch. Read her 
    words you will understand why the recovery of our totems is of the utmost 
    importance to us.&quot;<br>
    Aurutis tells 
    you, &quot;Last, I've recently made some improvements to the Sleeves of 
    Inexhaustibility, the Staff of Clarity, and the Spear of Purity. If you 
    would like to have one of these items, I will gladly improve it.&quot;</font></span></p>

    they could carry. Manyof the items have not true value, but some are quite 
    dangerous in the wrong hands...&quot;<br>
    Master Ulkas tells you, &quot;My skill have grown over the past few years. If I

    Heart preach this to the uninitiated, &quot;Trust your heart like you would trust 
    your blade. Use it in the cause of righteousness and none can withstand you. 
    Leave it unguarded and you shall know the final sorrow.&quot; I thank you for 
    mending this breach in our heritage. One day maybe we can take the fight to 
    these outcasts. To show our thanks, the Tukal Elders have authorized me to 
    have this spear made by some of our most talented crafters. It is not quite 
    ready to wield, but if you come across one of my gem-crafting brethern who 
    have been sent to the Isparian Arrival points, you may find this item to be

    General Casarius, &quot;Strength alone cannot win me this war. My mind must tell 
    me where to strike.&quot; Returning the Sceptre of the Mind brings peace to many 
    of our kin who follow the way of the Mind. The Tukal Elders have autorized 
    me to have a Staff formed by some of our most talented crafters. I present 
    you with this Staff of the Mind. It cannot be used yet, but if you come 
    across one of the emissaries we sent to the Isparian Arrival points, you may 
    be pleasantly surprised.&quot;</font></p>

    Isparian. The Tukal Elders have authorized me to have sleeves fashioned from 
    some of our most talented crafters. Here, take these Sleeves of the Arm. 
    While they are not quite suitable for use yet, if you can find one of our 
    emissaries we sent to the Isparian Arrival points, they may have soemthing 
    of use for you.&quot;<br>
