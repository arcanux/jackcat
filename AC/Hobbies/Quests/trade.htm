            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;I saw some Drudges make off with it 
            along with a bottle of Apple Cider.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;I hear tell they gone and holed up in 
            a small cave South of here. Try looking around 36.9N 35.1E.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;By the time ya go and bring back me 
            Da's old mug, I'll have a reply ready for ya.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </font>
            If you speak to him again before finishing the 
    task he gave you, he responds with more attitude:<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Eh? Ya lost or 
            something.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Perhaps you were kicked in the head by 
            an Auroch?&quot;<br>
    Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;The cave is South of here 
            at 36.9N 35.1E.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Go and get my Da's old mug and be 
            quick about it.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Oh...and did I mention all the Ursuins 
            around the cave?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            </font>
            Best just to do as he asks and find his mug! 
    The area around the cave he mentions can be hazardous to low-level 
    adventurers, since it is inhabited by quite a few Drudges and Ursuins. The cave 
    itself is a simple hole in the 
            ground (no portal). Inside are some Drudges guarding Renald's Old 
            Mug laying on the ground.&nbsp; Pick it up and return it to Renald 
    the Crabby, er, Eldest:<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You give Renald the Eldest Renald's Old Mug.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Gyah! Me Da's 
            mug. Ya found it!&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Um right. Me answer then.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;You can go and tell this Ursuin-spawned 
            dog Anton that Renald the Eldest says...&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;NO!&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;I'll not be trading with no accursed 
            Vianomtian.&quot;<br>
            Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Why? Well...cuz they're BLUE!&quot;</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">Renald the Eldest stares at you as if waiting 
            for you to agree.<br>
            You've earned 5,000 experience.<br>

    Hmmmm... seems that didn't quite go as planned.&nbsp; Well, nothing to do at 
    this point except head back to Sanamar to report in to Anton Sillezi.&nbsp; 
    There's a conveniently placed portal back to Sanamar east of Holtburg at 
    41.0N, 35.5E.&nbsp; Once you're back in Sanamar, speak to Anton Sillezi again:</font></p>
            <P align=left><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;You're back. Let me check your progress.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I haven't heard from Lubziklan al-Luq of 
            Yaraq.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I haven't heard from Gonjoku Den of 
            Shoushi.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I haven't heard from Renald the Eldest of 
            Holtburg.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            </font>Let's start with the good news.&nbsp; Handing Anton the note from Lubziklan al-Luq seems to make him happy:<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You give Anton Sillezi Lubziklan al-Luq Trade 
            Agreement.<br>
            Anton takes the letter and reads it.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;It seems I am in 
            your debt.&quot;</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You've earned 5,000 experience.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Hurry back when you 
            have word from any of the other merchants.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            </font>
            So far, so good.&nbsp; Now for the reply from 
            Gonjoku Den:<font color="#FFFF99"><br>
            </font>
            <br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You give Anton Sillezi Gonjoku Den Trade 
            Agreement.</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">Anton takes the letter and reads it.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Ah! Good news 
            indeed. Thank you for your help.&quot;</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You've earned 5,000 experience.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Hurry back when you 
            have word from any of the other merchants.&quot;</font><br>
            <br>
            That seemed to go well, too!&nbsp; Finally, the one you've been 
            worrying about - Renald the Eldest's refusal:<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You give Anton Sillezi Renald the Eldes 
            Refusal.<br>
            Anton takes the letter and reads it.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;WHAT! That old fool! 
            I can't prove it, but I'm sure this is somehow your fault.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Now I'll have to think of a way to smooth 
            things over.&quot;</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You've earned 5,000 experience.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Thanks for all your 
            help. Here's something that'll help you carry all you stuff in 
            future travels.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;What? Were you expecting more?&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I must be getting soft. Here's a little 
            extra for your troubles.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Oh. If you're looking for something to do, 
            you might talk to Seneschal Dalmour.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I hear he's looking for experienced 
            adventurers.&quot;</font><br>
            <font color="#66FF99">Anton Sillezi gives you Trade Note (25,000).<br>
            Anton Sillezi give you Pack.<br>
            <br>
            </font>
            Well, that wasn't so bad... he certainly could 
            have taken the news a lot worse!&nbsp; Since you don't need it any 
            more, you can give Anton back his list of Trade Contacts:<font color="#D6D2DD"><br>
            </font>
            <br>
            <font color="#66FF99">You give Anton Sillezi Trade Contacts.</font><br>
            <font color="#FFFF99">Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;I guess you don't 
            need directions then.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;Don't be getting lost because I'm not 
            going to look for you.&quot;<br>
            Anton Sillezi tells you, &quot;It'll be cheaper to hire another person 
            than to pay to have your bones found.&quot;<br>
