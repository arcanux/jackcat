	speculatively.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;I will accept your aid in this, but be warned. 
	Many things in the place I will send you are very, very dangerous for one of 
	your level of skill. I would highly recommend either going with many, many 
	others, or a large fellowship of those most powerful of adventurers.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Grael has awakened. My lord tried to stop 
	this, but it has come to pass. I fear the Black Spear's rage will consume 
	this world, if he is not stopped. To that end, my Lord has sent me to aid 
	you and all those who go with you.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;First, a little lesson in history...&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Long ago, Grael, the Black Spear of the 
	Kemeroi, chose to sleep. The place he chose to sleep was an isle north of 
	here, north of Vissidal Isle. His presence covered the island in Shadow, and 
	the isle soon came to be called the Dark Isle.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Those Falatacot who followed the Old One, 
	N'cthail took a chance and used ancient seals to sink the isle below the 
	waves. It was their hope that none would ever wake Grael and that this world 
	would be free of him forever. Now, however, that wish has been undone by 
	another.&quot;<br>
	Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;I can show you the path to this Temple. Though 
	the original Crystal binding the Isle to the deeps has been destroyed, it 
	must not be allowed to reform, lest the Isle sink back down beneath the 
	waves. The Temple is heavily defended. There are wards that block the use of 
	the portals to the Catacombs. I've located a tablet that will allow me to 
	enchant you to bypass the Eastern Temple Catacomb's wards. Go into the 
	Temple. There is a portal to the Temple opened at 70.4N, 50.5E. Find the 
	entrance to the Eastern Catacombs, bring back the Tablet you will find 
	there, and I can give you further access to the Temple.&quot;</font></font></p>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hey Maggie! Love the site, and as its patch 
	day <span lang="en-us">I</span> thought <span lang="en-us">I'd</span> let 
	everyone know about the new Grael<span lang="en-us">'</span>s island 
	flagging quest!<br>
	<br>
	To start with, head to Neydissa castle [Etana of WE sends a correction to 
	the location -- Kiriel is at Bandit Castle] and speak to Kiriel Shadowborn at 
	66.3N 50.0E. He'll direct you head to 70.4N 50.5E, where you can speak to 
	Lanaith. He will instruct you to head to the Vissidel Isles, where a nest of 
	Mukkir may be located at 81.0N 59.3E. It<span lang="en-us">'</span>s lvl 
	150+ and cannot be summoned nor recalled. As you make your way through you 
	will encounter numerous forms of Mukkir as well as the new &quot;decaying Ruschk 
	Laktar&quot;. Eventually, you will come to a locked door. The key can be found on 
	the Fanatical Mukkir Ward Guardian, who spawns in the same room (lvl 180 
	Mukkir). He drops only 1 key with 1 use, which is all that is needed. 
	Through the door you will encounter more Mukkir as well as Laktar. 
	Eventually the hall leads to a portal which you must USE to enter, much like 
	the one on Bobo. Through the portal and BAM! you<span lang="en-us">'</span>re 
	on Grael<span lang="en-us">'</span>s island. You<span lang="en-us">'</span>re 
	dropped on what looks like an altar of some kind. Not far off there is a 
	Lifestone there as well as a representative of both King Varicci and Queen 
	Elyssa, both of whom seek pro<span lang="en-us">o</span>f of killing 
	monsters on the new island. There are many new creatures on the island and 
	they hit HARD! There is also a new &quot;The deep&quot; located by the island drop as 
	well. Best of luck to all who brave this new fronti<span lang="en-us">e</span>r! 
	There is also a Portal to the &quot;Dark Isle&quot; located at 75.8N 70.2E, but it can 
	only be accessed AFTER you have landed on the island once before as that 
	flags you to enter it. <br>

	<span lang="en-us">T</span>here is an npc next to the portal for the isn

	&quot;Hi Maggie! Love your site. :) Thought I'd give you a comprehensive run thru 
	so that people could run thru the New Island Flagging Dungy successfully.<br>
	<br>
	Okies, here goes:<br>
	Flagging: Arwic to Mt. Shortcut 34.9n 56e, from there run to Bandit Castle 
	portal at 42.4n 60.5e (when you see houses ahead start to turn North)<br>
	<br>
	From the Bandit Castle drop, run to Lanaith.<br>
	<br>
	Once you talk to Lanaith, you are flagged for 24 hours. LS recall to Vissy, 
	and then run due North from the Lifestone to the New Island flagging dungy.<br>
	<br>
	Upon entrance, take ramp and turn left. Go down a hall and down another ramp 
	to a room with pillars. Take the West exit to another room. <br>
	<br>
	Take the South exit from this open room, and then turn Right (West). Go down 
	a ramp, to a room with Checker Square floor. Take the East exit, and then 
	turn left. Take left at fork that follows, and then left again at the fork 
	that follows that one. Go STRAIGHT (East) in this room, a room that has 
	rounded arches in the ceiling.<br>
	<br>
	Bear left, and then go down a hall. You will arrive in an area with lefts 
	and rights, but continue straight (North). Continue across a bridge. Go 
	straight at 3 way fork, to a 6 way fork. Go NW at this 6 way fork. Then go 
	straight (North) at next 3 way fork. Go Left (West) at the T intersection.<br>
	<br>
	Go Left (North) at the fork you next see, and continue North through next 
	area. Go up ramp, and then Left at T intersection. Turn Right (South), and 
	go down the hall. Turn Left (West), which brings you to a porch-like area. 
	Go through that porch-like area, and take the West hall out. <br>
	<br>
	Open door, then bear left. Turn left at next intersection (West). Kill the 
	Guardian for the key. Use that key on the door. Go around through a hall, 
	continuing straight (North). Bear North in the next Black and Red area. <br>
	<br>
	Kill the Spire, and enter the portal. Upon arrival head to the Lifestone to 
	LS there.<br>
	<br>
	Hope that helps folks, it's as thorough as I could make it. Hopefully with 
	this run thru people can make this run solo. :)&quot;</font></span><p>
