	The Servant of Asheron carefully takes the Shadow Anchor Piece from your 
	hands and swallows it. His white light flares blindingly for a moment and 
	then returns to normal.<br>
	Asheron's Servant tells you, &quot;We have destroyed a small portion of the 
	Shadow Anchor's strength. Here is the reward that I promised you. This once 
	belonged to the young Queen Carraida of Haebrous, who died in Grael's Slave 
	Rebellion. After her death the King could not stand to be reminded of his 
	loss and gave her three favorite pieces of jewelry to my master of that age, 
	Lord Alashorn. She was a proud Haebrean. I'm sure she would be pleased to 
	know that they have been passed on to a noble hero. Perhaps you can, in some 
	small way, take vengeance against Grael on her behalf. When all three pieces 
	are worn together, their energies will combine to bestow an additional 
	enchantment upon you. If you continue your efforts in weakening the Shadow 
	Anchor, I will give you the other pieces.&quot;<br>
	Asheron's Servant gives you Pendant of Carraida.<br>
	Asheron's Servant tells you, &quot;Return this piece jewelry to me if you would 
	rather hone your skills, but I warn you, I will never offer it to you 
	again.&quot;</font></p>

	Asheron's Servant grants you the title Carraida's Avenger.<br>
	Asheron's Servant tells you, &quot;The forces holding the Shadow Mouths here have 
	been significantly weakened thanks to your heroic efforts. I am sure we will 
	be able to defend the tower now. Here is Carraida's Bracelet. Remember her.&quot; 
	Asheron's Servant gives you Bracelet of Carraida.<br>

	again.&quot;<br>
	Asheron's Servant tells you, &quot;If you wish to continue your efforts in 
	weakening the Shadow Anchor I will reward you with a bit of knowledge for 
	each piece you bring me. However, you must wait a short time before 
	collecting more pieces. Exposing yourself to the Shadow Anchors energy so 
	soon would be to great a risk. Event you might fall under Grael's control.&quot;<br>
