      </i>
    <small><i>Years ago, the mage Harlune the Misanthrope lived in Arwic. Harlune was an exceptionally
    powerful Life Mage. Some say he had gained mastery over death itself. Young mages came
    from all corners of Dereth seeking<span lang="en-us"> </span>apprenticeship, yet he only took a single pupil; Celcynd of Rithwic, who later became the first of us to master the Empyrean portal spells.
    Celcynd scribed these spells for Harlune, but the elder mage considered them more trouble
    than they were worth, and locked them away. Harlune later moved into a cave to the north,
    infested by mites, to avoid would-be apprentices.</i></small></font></p>

      Mount Lethe is a volcano in the west Direlands. 86W 34S. Little volcano, 
      with old magma tubes leading down into it. There were strange crystals 
      found deep in it, so some noble - forget his name - organized an 
      expedition to mine them out, find a use for them. Go to the very bottom, 
      below the old mine. There were funny rumors about the noble. Miners 
      claimed to see cloaked figures in the corner of their eye. Many fled, but 
      money was good and guards strong. Then Lethe erupted, killed the workers 
      and the noble.<br>
      <br>
      </i><span lang="en-us">The Mount Lethe Magma Tubes are located at 33.8S, 
      85.3W (restricted to levels 20+, cannot be summoned). To reach them, you 
      can make the run from Ayan Baqur. If you're lucky enough to know of 
      someone with a tie to the Sclavus Cathedral (33.5S, 80.0W), the Magma 
      Tubes are just a short run away.</span></font></p>
