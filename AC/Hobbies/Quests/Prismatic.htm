    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#D6D2DD">Josef says, &quot;Hey you! 
    Get over here a minutes I need to talk to you.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;I knew if I whispered long enough 
    one of you outsiders would make your way over to me. The names Josef, and 
    before you ask no there's no surname. Just Josef. Don't ask cuase I ain't 
    tellin'.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Now listen up, and listen up well cause i don't like 
    taking to much time in repeating myself. It makes me waste precious air and 
    that's not fun.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef clears his throat and then drops his voice into 
    a deep whisper.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;A while back the boss, Martine, was 
    planning on opening the way to Marae Lassel. A new home for people. Thing is 
    there were people there already, like us but they grew up different. No big 
    deal right? Well the thing is when he did his spell or whatever something 
    else happened.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He finished his little trick and suddenly a portal storm 
    hit the center of the living area here. Portal energy was whipping off the 
    walls and down the corridors. Next thing we know there's a guy sitting in 
    the middle of the room, naked as the day he was born and about eight, maybe 
    nine feet tall.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He was real confused. Had no clue where he had come from 
    or where he was, just his name. Gaerlan. And he said over and over 
    again...is Asheron among you.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Now here's the rub. I know a lot more than that, but I 
    need some help. So you help me...I help you. Take this.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef gives you Josef's Wish List.</font></font></p>
    <p><i><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Josef's Wish List</b><br>
    Here is a list of things that I think Martine might like. You help me out, I 
    help you. It's simple really.<br>
    <br>
    Needs:<br>
    <br>
    Virindi Masks<br>
    Yellow Virindi Jewels<br>
    Quiddity Ingots<br>
    Shackles of Obedience<br>
    Directive Keys<br>
    Master Keys<br>
    Singularity Keys</font></i></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You 
    give Josef Virindi Mask. </font><br>
    <font color="#D6D2DD">Josef says, &quot;Not bad. Not bad at all. You got 
    connections kid. This will get me in real good.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef snickers and looks you over. </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;I guess that means that I've got 
    some singing to do. No problem. Grab a chair maybe.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef pauses a long moment. </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;Gaerlan, yeah that was the guys 
    name. Where he came from nobody knows but Martine came right close to 
    turning him into slag after he got back from opening the portals to Marae 
    Lassel. The only thing that allowed the guy to stay was that he groveled 
    better than anyone I had ever seen grovel. Even better than Ketnan.&quot; <br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Anyway, this guy said that he had the ability to help 
    Martine, so long as he kept him alive. Martine was wary at first. When I say 
    wary I mean really wary. You see Martine was really trying to get himself 
    back on the straight and narrow. Kind of like what he did for us and all. 
    But he listened to the guy anyway. It went well. I guess. Martine allowed 
    him to stay. Heck he even gave him his own room within this underground 
    city.&quot; <br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Where is it? Keep the goodies coming.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give 
    Josef Yellow Jewel.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Hmm, nice trinket.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Okay so this Gaerlan guy, he starts &quot;assisting&quot; Martine 
    with some of his endeavours, going with him out to blow up the arrival 
    points around Dereth. See it went like this.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Martine told this guy about the fact that he had it in for 
    Asheron. Mistake one, this guy was into that and used that to his advantage. 
    See, this guy never looked at us as anything more than vermin. Really it's 
    true. Once or twice I overheard him talking about how we had bred as quickly 
    as vermin that had come from our world.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;I guess they brought them back after they visited us. Now 
    this was something that was a little odd to hear, but I guess that a long 
    time ago they used to go to different worlds and watch. Then the portals 
    started opening to other places...I never pieced that together. But I know 
    that this guy Gaerlan put the poison thoughts into Martine's head.<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Martine had been getting better. He was less whimsical 
    from time to time. More stable really. Then the poison started and the 
    high-pitched voice came back. Then he set out to destroy the arrival points 
    from Ispar.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Martine had no idea what was happening with that, but I 
    know that this guy did. He even wrote about it I'd guess.&quot;</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give 
    Josef Quiddity Ingot.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;Pulling 
    out all the stops now aren't you.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Okay then. Martine went to those places where the portals 
    dropped people from Dereth and together with Gaerlan they sealed them 
    closed. No more people that went through the portal that lead there could 
    get through.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Kind of makes you wonder, huh? At any rate the deed was 
    doen. Martine was happy, no content, you can never really say that he has 
    been happy. I mean the guy did lose his wife and child and then his 
    humanity. That has to be rought right?&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;So this Gaerlan guy starts riling him up and getting him 
    to listen to his hatred, or the Virindi in him, whatever that is. Then 
    Martine builds a son. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true. He thought about 
    it and it happened. Of course Gaerlan was there the entire time, assisting 
    him in the creation of this thing. A Hollow Minion. I tell you, he dalled it 
    son and embraced it. And sent it out into the world.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He did that three times in all. Each time, they got a 
    little tougher. But still Martine wasn't done. He set about a plan to kill 
    the Queen. Bu then that was twisted. Gaerlan made sure of that. &quot;The boy he 
    said. The boy. You have a son now, Martine. You won't need two.&quot; Martine 
    listened and lo, he set about to kill Borelean.&quot;<br>
    Josef shakes his head.<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;That was just not like Martine. Just not like him. I'm 
    sorry I can't talk about this anymore.&quot;</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You 
    give Josef Shakles of Obedience.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;These won't help me much, but...&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;That should help you a little. See, I want these for a 
    specific reason. They'd remind Martine of what the Virindi did to him. We 
    don't want that happening to him ever again. By we I mean the majority of us 
    here. All of us had problems. Some greater than others, but we did all have 
    problems and Martine gave us something that none of us had, Hope.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;In a sense he was our savior. He 
    took us out of the darkest times that any of us had ever faced, brought us 
    back from that brink and got us motivated to live again.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Not easy to do with a bunch of ne'er do wells. But he did 
    it. We started working with him to build places that we could call our own. 
    Do things that we could have pride in. We struggled it's true but in the end 
    we were feeling better and things were looking up. Until Gaerlan came back. 
    And then the voice returned.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef lowers his eyes.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;It was like watching your best 
    friend disappear. He had beaten that thing back. It was gone, forever. But 
    now it was back.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Nothing more I can say about that.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give 
    Josef Directive Key.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Nice one.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Settle in. So Martine set his sights on the kid. Vile. Out 
    of character. Why did we stay you wonder? We're loyal to Martine. Loyal 
    cause he saved us from something worse than any death could be. He saved us 
    from despair.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;What else could we do? We stayed with him. But this guy 
    Gaerlan preyed on him more. He helped him with the Olthoi. He demonstrated 
    some intense understanding about their bodies. Strong points, weak points. 
    The best place to strke them to incapacitate but not kill them. Things that 
    no one of us would have known. Where he got that knowledge I don't know.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He helped Marine where the Virindi failed. He made a 
    hollow version of the Olthoi. Weaker. But damn they hit hard and there was 
    not way to defend against them. Funny thing is Gaerlan would never go near 
    them.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;But he convinced Martine to invade the mainland of Dereth. 
    That Elysa and Ahseron were joined now, making war on his son. Trying to 
    bring about Martine's destruction now.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;And also about this time, Gaerland started to gain more 
    freedom, and he used it. We'd inform Martine but he didn't care. He was busy 
    off on his own. Not until recently did we start to realize that he was 
    visiting Elysa.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;There's more, but we made a deal.&quot;</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give 
    Josef Master Key.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Hmm more trinkets. Good job.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Martine started getting a little more lucid around this 
    time. Not a lot mind you, but with Gaerlan taking some time away from 
    constant contact with Martine he started to act more normal. Though 
    something had really changed within him and every night he would leave here 
    to go visit Elysa.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He watched her from afar at first, then got closer and 
    closer until recently he came back here and became very solemn. No silent.&quot;
    <br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;He hasn't spoken in the longest time. Not since Gaerlan 
    shunted him like a child. Not since he killed Asheron.&quot;<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Josef lowers his eyes and 
    shakes his head.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Now, things are breaking down. We need him you see. Some 
    of us still think that we can pull him around. Others think that we'd be 
    better to foster his hate and tell him to finish the job. Still 
    others...like me think he did the job. There is no hope left. Asheron is 
    dead. And Martine has finally realized the truth.&quot;<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Josef looks you dead in 
    the eye and speaks solemnly.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Asheron never meant harm to anyone. This world, the Olthoi, 
    the pain. It was never him. It was never him...and now Marine has killed the 
    brightest light that this world had.&quot;</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You 
    give Josef Singularity Key.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;This is the best possible thing you 
    could give me friend.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Martine likes these the most because it means that you not 
    only killed one of their most powerful members, but you have also found a 
    way to steal some of their treasures.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef manages a weak smile.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;Take this.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Josef gives you Gaerlan's Key.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Josef tells you, &quot;See I've made a life of finding 
    information. I listened to everything and learned as much as I could. In his 
    room Gaerlan kept a chest. In that chest must be something special. It was 
    bright, like the rainbow and vibrant. Get what you can, he left it. Oh and 
    getting there just takes a little leap of faith.&quot;<br>
    Josef tells you, &quot;Good luck, friend.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
