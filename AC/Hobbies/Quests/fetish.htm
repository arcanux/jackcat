<font color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit to examine your A Soggy Note.</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">The hermit strains to read the handwriting, then returns 
the note to you.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I wrote this?&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Yes, yes it seems I did write this, so very long 
ago...&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;The secret...yes, the secret -- I remember 
something now.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Do you intend to linger? I 
suppose I could make some cinnamon tea if you'd like to stay a while longer...if 
only I could remember where I put the cinnamon.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;When I was your age I had to walk uphill in the 
snow both ways to get to the Lyceum. You kids have it easy these days.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;If you aren't leaving, at least make yourself 
useful. Go stand at the bottom of the tower and put this apple on your head. I 
want to try something...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Lighthouse Hermit gives you Apple.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;What were we talking about? 
Oh that's right, your departure! Hurry along now and return soon!&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I can't remember if you were arriving or leaving 
-- I am just that old.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A report from Gandalf Zu'l Zoran of 
SC: &quot;Hiya Maggie, I followed up on a town crier rumor nd headed to the Dires 
Great Lighthouse at 25.8S, 46.9W there you will find Hermit. When you approach 
Hermit you get the following:&quot; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">The hermit's 
eyes grow wide as he begins to speak.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Ah, I do remember now. I 
didn't think it would take this long, but no matter - you are here. If you will 
but listen to my story, I will reveal a great secret to you.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I once was the greatest and most feared arbalister 
in all of Dereth. I once had everything a man could want from this life, and I 
have enjoyed all that I have experienced over the long years.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;But decades of adventure and excitement have 
caught up finally, I'm afraid. I find myself unable to see the bull's-eye any 
longer, thanks to the slow dimming of my sight. And more often than not I find 
the string to be too powerful for these feeble hands to draw or load.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;However, a ghost of the past still stirs in this 
old body. And before death's final arrow tears through the dark night in search 
of this weary target, I must see to it that my secret becomes known -- it is 
with you I entrust this knowledge.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="#66FF99">The old hermit shifts his position, and begins to talk with a slow and 
deliberate voice.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I have seen with my own eyes the devastating power 
of magic; how easily a burning fireball can send the most skilled archer to his 
demise!&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;It has long been said: &quot;The only way to combat 
magic is with stronger magic.&quot; Before you sits an old man who has come to 
understand what this truly means.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I obtained certain artifacts and studied about 
old, forgotten magic. I devised for myself a way to empower my crossbow with a 
powerful, arcane device - a fetish, one might call it.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Any missile weapon may be empowered similarly. Be 
warned - the magic is strong, and thus irreversible by any process I know of. I 
will tell you all I can remember soon enough. But today I have talked long 
enough.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Travel now to Aerlinthe Island. Find the old ones, 
the ancient diamond behemoths roaming that enchanted, volcanic isle. Retrieve 
the ancient diamond relic, and return to me. I should more clearly see the past 
when I am again holding a piece of it.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I headed to Aerlinthe to hunt for 
the new golems and found the Ancient Diamond Golem's (see included picture) of 
which hermit was talking about<br>
<br>
After killing a few of them I found on one of them an Ancient Diamond Idol (see 
included picture)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I headed back to Hermit and he told 
me this when I gave him the idol :</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit

</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The hermit's eyes grow wide 
as he looks at the diamond relic.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;So you found the golems then? I trust they did not 
give you too much trouble -- I see a stout and strong dead-eye when I look into 
your eyes!&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Do not lose this priceless artifact. You will need 
to harness the magical, protective power found within it -- eventually.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Ah, but you have so much to do yet. Let us not 
delay any longer! You must venture to the Itheanc Cathedral, in the Veseyan 
Islands. The horrible fleshless dead, the blood fiends, have a most precious 
treasure in their possession -- a bright, silvery ring.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;You must find this ring, for it contains a most 
vital magical element.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hermit send me to hunt for Blood 
Fiend's I found after a while the ring Hermit was talking about. (see 
screenshots)<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">When I gave him the ring he said this :
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit 
to examine your Warding Ring.<br>
The hermit rolls the ring back and forth in his hand slowly, thinking deeply 
about the past.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;A warding ring...&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Long ago I took a ring identical to this one from 
the charred and burning hand of a fiend. That time seems unreal to me now, 
beyond my grasp in memory.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I do remember some of the important details, 
though. This ring conceals a small glass vial containing blood. You will need 
this foul fluid.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;There is no way for either of us to remove the 
vial from the ring, I'm afraid. But there is one who can -- one who knows of the 
darker magics.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;You must locate the seer that calls the wild 
jungles of Aphus Lassel her home, and show this ring to her.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;She will know what to do, and she will help you.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I headed to AL after Hermit told me, 
and headed to Kleeoh, when I turned in the ring to here she said this:</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give Kleeoh Warding Ring.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;Ah, dis be a special ring. A loop with a secret catch, to 
release dis dark poision vial. Oh, you be thinkin' it be blood in dere?&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;Aye, blood it was. But now death it be for those who so much 
as touch a drip-drop of it. You be careful now, fussin' around with dis mess.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Kleeoh gives you Vial of 
Black Blood.<br>
Kleeoh gives you Warding Ring.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;Dere is only one reason why you would be out here messin' 
with such evil maka. You be lookin' to make power from idols, you be! Ha!&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;I know you been talkin' to dat old man. And I know what you 
be needin' from here, if you be after the same madness he was.&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;Some assailers been getting' da jungle sick about them. Dere 
furry coat be getting' rough, and da sickness be all over it.&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;You gonna have to fight the wooly beasts and dere jungle 
sickness -- and get some fur. Dey be all over da jungle, like a plague. You find 
dem, and bring back to us, bring back to us, bring back to us...&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;What, you be thinkin' it's easy to make dangerous big maka? 
Ha ha!&quot;<br>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Around her cottage I found some new tuskers : 
Infected Assailer (picture included)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I hunted alot of infected Assailer

</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Kleeoh twists a small lock of 
fur out of the reeking, moist clump, and tucks it away. She hands the rest back 
to you.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;You got a lot dere. I only take what I need, and no more.&quot;<br>
Kleeoh tells you, &quot;I hope you and dat old hermit know what you doing! Evil maka 
like this needs a strong bond, and dis big wooly fur is a good start - but I do 
not know how you will create such a thing.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit

Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;So you have been to the seer's jungle abode? You 
seem to be handling all of this adventure and excitement quite easily.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Hold onto this vial as if your life depended on 
it. The blood will be useful...but I am having trouble remembering in what way.&quot;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit 
to examine your Infected Assailer Fur.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Oh, what an awful smell! I remember this stench 
more than ever! I hope the experience did not make you too ill.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The old hermit thinks hard 
for a few moments.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I remember...I took the fur somewhere, and it was 
fashioned into a sturdy piece of rope, or cord if you will.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I am sorry, but I cannot recall how this was 
accomplished. You will have to figure out a way to bind or weave this fur.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Take the Fur to Neydisa Castle and 
use it on the Loom you will get:<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give Loom Infected 
Assailer Fur.<br>
You feed the infected assailer fur into the loom, hoping it does not break the 
machine.<br>
The loom whines loudly, and continues to weave the fur.<br>
The loom produces a thick, braided cord of tusker fur.<br>
Loom gives you Woven Assailer Fur.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse 
Hermit to examine your Woven Assailer Fur.<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Lighthouse Hermit tells you, 
&quot;Ah, you've done it -- I knew you would find a way!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Use the blood on the Woven Fur:</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Suddenly a thought bursts 
into your mind: &quot;The blood will strengthen the bond.&quot; Had Kleeoh said this?</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;I remember now! The braided tusker fur is 
physically strong, indeed -- however it must be magically strong as well, 
otherwise it is useless.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You pour the black blood all 
over the woven tusker fur.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You allow Lighthouse Hermit 
to examine your Blood-soaked Cord.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The hermit pulls on the ends 
of the blood-soaked cord, testing it's toughness.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;You could not have done better! This braided cord, 
soaked in the black blood of the fiends, will serve as a bridge between the two 
idol guardians. It will also bind the powerful magic of the idols to your 
weapon.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;Speaking of idols, you will be pleased to know 
there is only one more relic to obtain.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;The diamond relic will provide magical protection, 
but used alone it is heavy and unbalancing. You would hardly be able to steady 
your weapon with only one idol hanging from it!&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;A similar idol is necessary not only to balance 
the weight of the first idol, but to balance it's protective powers as well.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;It is getting late, so I will not keep you any 
longer. You must make your way to Marae Lassel, and retrieve a relic from the 
Great Elariwood golems that inhabit the wild northern forests of that island.&quot;<br>
Lighthouse Hermit tells you, &quot;You will know it when you see it. An elariwood 
idol is very similar to a diamond idol in appearance. Find it and return to me.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Alien Killer of 
SC reports on where to find Great Elariwood Idols:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the Subway, 
take the Holtburg portal and go to the West Outpost, where you are going to find 
a Redsphire (spelling?) portal. Enter Redsphire and follow the rode to where you 
would turn in Pincers. There is a North Plains Portal there, take that. Beware: 
If you cant handle groups of lvl 70-110 monsters, don't enter. Once your in, run 
towards the cliff and find the strip of land that is like a forest. Run up and 
down the strip untill you find a group (usually 3) of Great Elariwood Golems.
