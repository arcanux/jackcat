    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the Seat 
    of Knorr, take the Research Chambers Conveyance. Head north from the 
    entrance and make a left heading down the hall. Make a right at the T and 
    head down another hall. Take the ramp down into the room with the Blue Orb. 
    Once everyone who needs them has their orbs, head east into the the 2nd room 
    with the Green Orb. From the green room take the passage in the NE corner 
    (not the green olthoi tunnel) to reach the Red Orb Room. From the Red Room, 
    take the east passage back, heading west at the bookshelf, then south to the 
    Seat of Knorr. <b><br>
    </b> <br>
    If you're feeling adventurous, you can take the Olthoi tunnel from the green 
    room to the olthoi caverns. Jump into the acid pit, take the passage to the 
    south, and you'll arrive at a secret Olthoi breeding ground, similar to the 
    Royal Hive on Marae Lassel. A dozen or so Olthoi Swarm Guardians respawn 
    approximately every 30 seconds. Head up the ramp and and and you'll reach a 
    room with a secret passage behind a bookcase (open with lever) which takes 
    your right back to the Seat of Knorr!</font></span></p>

    The final section contains the forge where you can upgrade your armor 
    and helm. From the Seat of Knorr take the Forge Conveyance. Head South from 
    the entrance, then take the passage on the right at the 3 way split heading 
    SW (the dungeon is symmetrical; you could also take the left passage). Go through a gated door, fighting past the Olthoi Swarm Guardians, then 
    south down the ramp. Again go through a gated door, then take an immediate 
    left heading east. Kill as many Olthoi through the door as possible before 
    heading in to the forge room.</font></span></p>
