<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Town Crier tells you, &quot;If you see a young man named Tamian Wilmit, his 
    friends in Rithwic are very worried about him and would like to know where 
    he is.&quot;</font><p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, I 
don't know about that. Sounds like some of his &quot;friends&quot; aren't overly 
concerned! ;-) To begin, speak with Astara Duskshield in Rithwic at 10.3N, 58.3E 
near the Weaponsmith. </font></span>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Astara Duskshield tells you, &quot;Hello. Have you seen Tamian 
Wilmit around at all lately? I have not seen him in quite some time now. I am 
concerned about him, he had been acting a bit strange lately. He is a very dear 
friend. If you could find where he is I would very much appreciate it. He had a 
row with my friend Delton Hardor. Very out of character for Tamian.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">As Astara instructs, next find </span>Delton Hardor<span lang="en-us">.

<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Delton Hardor tells you, &quot;Have I seen Tamian Wilmit? 
Strange fellow he is, not very able. Seems he can do nothing. I do not 
understand why Astara is still friends with him. Tis true, they knew each other 
on Ispar when younger but he is of no use here. Little in the way of useful 
skills, he has.&quot;<br>
Delton Hardor tells you, &quot;Yes, you may go tell Astara I said so. He tried to 
fight me in sword practise. I swatted him finely for he is no good with a blade 
and he came at me like a rabid Carenzi. I had to give him a good thrashing, 
lucky he is we were using wood, not steel. Astara made me stop, also screamed at 
him, he slunk away like a drudge.&quot;<br>
Delton Hardor tells you, &quot;I believe the last time I saw him was over by Ji 
Tenxien the Tailor. You could ask her.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Ji Tenxien the Tailor is just a building away at </span>10.7N, 59.2E<span lang="en-us">. 
Speak to her and she'll send off to speak to yet another one of the Rithwic 
townspeople.</span><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Ji Tenxien the Tailor tells you, &quot;No, I have not seen 
Tamian Wilmit, not in a while. That boy is not good for much. Lazy, if you ask 
me. Always has his nose stuck in a piece of parchment. Perhaps Wylreda the 
Scribe has seen him. Tamian is always scrounging parchment off her.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Wylreda the Scribe can be found in The Guilded Tome at </span>10.6N, 58.4E<span lang="en-us">. 
When you speak with her, you end right back where you started, talking to Astara.</span><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Wylreda the Scribe tells you, &quot;Tamian, has not been here 
lately, now that you mention it. Always in need of parchment, he is. He helps me 
out a bit in exchange for it. Cannot seem to do much around here but he is deft 
with ink and quill. Draws quite well, you know.&quot;<br>
Wylreda the Scribe tells you, &quot;Hmmm. An acquaintance of mine, a Scribe named 
Tian Li Quan traveled through here recently and stayed with Tamian's family. 
Tamian was fascinated with some Empyrean relic the Scribe had evidence of. 
Perhaps his friend Astara knows of this, you should ask her.&quot;<br>
</font><br>
<span lang="en-us">Now you're getting somewhere! When you return to Astara, 
you finally get a clue about where Tamian may have gone. Astara will send you 
off to Lin to find out more about a drawing a scribe had given him. <br>
</span>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">Astara sighs</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Astara Duskshield tells you, &quot;Of late, Tamian had been 
extremely interested in something a Scribe who was travelling through here had 
given him. It had to do with a tower. Tamian is always drawing towers and such. 
The Scribe was named Tian Li Quan and resides in Lin, I believe. Tamian is no 
great traveler and that is quite a way from here. Strange that he would go and 
say nothing, but perhaps...&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Next head to Lin to find Tian Li Quan at </span>54.4S, 73.1E<span lang="en-us">. 
Lin can be reached by taking the portal from Tou-Tou at 28.0S, 95.4E or by 
taking the Victory Residental Quarters portal in Samsur at 3.2S, 19.1E.<br>
</span>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Tian Li Quan tells you, &quot;Why yes, I do know Tamian Wilmit. 
I met him when I was travelling through Rithwic. Then he came here not too long 
ago. He seemed unhappy, and driven. His goal is to find an Empyrean structure 
that I had shown him evidence of, a sketch I let him have while staying with his 
family. He did some research while he was here but did not speak much to me 
about it.&quot;<br>
Tian Li Quan tells you, &quot;He left me a sealed copy of his journal in case someone 
came by looking for him. I think you are not the person he imagined may show up 
but I believe I should let you have it. He went to look for this structure. He 
went west.&quot;</font><br>

first), you'll see a note at the entrance, instructing you to get a key from one

well, around. Doing the dishes or the laundry every once in while doesn't hurt 
either. I'm just saying.</font></span></p>
