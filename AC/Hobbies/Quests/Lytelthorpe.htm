    Theories About Wings</b><br>
    Ercel the Wing Collector, a scholarly fellow, resides at the East 
    Lytelthorpe Outpost (0.9 N, 54.2 E). He's spent his days studying the 
    Phyntos Wasps of Dereth. Sadly, however, he's lost the book he was writing 
    in some old ruins. (These NPCs can't seem to hold on to 
    anything, can they? ;) If you find his missing book, he'll give you 
    <span lang="en-us">some experience as a reward and will also give you </span>a 
    recommendation to take to Lord Aleval at Lytelthorpe Keep for further 
    adventures.</font><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Ercel 
    the Wing Collector tells you, &quot;I study wings. I have a collection of them, 
    but I need more phyntos wasp wings in good condition. If you bring me any 
    I'll pay you.&quot;<br>
    Ercel the Wing Collector tells you, &quot;I'm writing a book on the subject, but 
    alas, I lost it in the ruins east of here. Now I must start all over again! 
    If you ever find my book please bring it to me.&quot;<br>
    Ercel the Wing Collector tells you, &quot;To get to the ruins, follow the pillars 
    going east. Please hurry before the creatures destroy my book.&quot;<br>
    Ercel the Wing Collector tells you, &quot;Oh, once in the ruins, try to find the 
    trail of rocks.&quot;</font></font></p>

    large room with a Revitalize Other I Fountain. You'll have to fight your way 
    past a <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudge</a> Slinker, a Sneaker and a Prowler.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Take the passageway directly across the fountain and go up and through a 
    door. Follow the stones further until the dungeon turns from green to brown. 
    As you head deeper, keep following the stone path until you come to a gated 
    door guarded by a Drudge Skulker and a Gnawer Shreth. Inside you'll find the 
    chest containing Ercel's book, </font>

      <font color="#D6D2DD">Beltslora the Collector says, &quot;I hate this grey shirt. I don't look good 
      in it.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
      </font>
      <br>
      Even the NPCs of Dereth like to look their best! When you retrieve 
      Beltslora's favorite shirt from the caves to the north where she used to 
      live, you'll understand why she misses wearing it. It's pretty! Speak with 
      this fashion conscious Collector at the West Lytelthorpe Outpost (1.0N, 
      48.3E) for directions on recovering the lost article of clothing.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Beltslora the 
      Collector tells you, &quot;Many of us used to live in the caves to the north 
      because this area was full of nasty creatures. But we drove them out and 
      built Lytelthorpe here.&quot;<br>
      Beltslora the Collector tells you, &quot;Now the monsters have retreated into 
      the caves where we once lived. Unfortunately, I accidentally left my 
      favorite shirt there. Maybe you could get it for me.&quot;<br>
      Beltslora the Collector tells you, &quot;To get to the cave we lived in, follow 
      the line of apple trees directly north of here. Be careful if you go 
      there, and follow the line of candles.&quot;</font></font></p>

      </font><br>
      Follow the line of apple trees to The Ruined Cave Outpost (2.3N, 48.3E 
      restricted to levels 1-<span lang="en-us">20</span>). Inside you'll encounter the numerous 
      <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudges</a> 
      who have taken up residence there. As Beltslora instructs, follow the line 
      of candles down a passage to a gated door. Once through the door<span lang="en-us">, 
      you'll head </span>past a long narrow room with a few drudges and newbie chests<span lang="en-us"> 
      to </span>the sleeping chambers of the previous residents. The numerous 
      <span lang="en-us">rooms</span> may be confusing, so <span lang="en-us">
      you may consider bringing</span> a friend along to help 
      fight the drudges as you explore<span lang="en-us">. </span>The room you're looking for has a candle 
      stationed outside the door and is approximately the second chamber on the 
      left.<br>
      <br>
      The two chests inside are guarded by a Drudge Sneaker and a Drudge 
      Skulker. The one on the left contains the Pretty Shirt<span lang="en-us"> 
      (24 hour timer).</span><br>
      <br>
      It's tempting to want to keep the shirt, with its attractive embroidery on 
      the collar, for yourself. But do the right thing and return it to 
      Beltslora back at the Outpost. It's so seldom anyone comes by who can open 
      a portal to <span lang="en-us">the Hub (Subway) </span>for her so she could trade for some nicer clothes. It's a 
      shame to keep her in that old grey shirt that she detests. As you might 
      expect, she's very grateful for the return of her favorite shirt! </font></p>

      drink here ever since the distillery was overrun.&quot;<br>

      Lord Aleval says he'd go himself if he could. But it's probably a good 
      thing he's too high a level to enter the Distillery. If you watch him for 
      a while, you'll see that he pretty much hangs out on the top of that 
      tower, drinking Nectar and Ambrosia all day! ;) The </font><font size="2" face="Arial">

      A</span>round <span lang="en-us">a</span> corner <span lang="en-us">you'll

      a chest guarded by a few drudges. Although that has some nice newbie loot, 
      it's not the chest you're looking for. Instead, take the right passage 
      down, fighting the occasional drudge, until you reach a wooden door. This 
      door opens into a large room with huge wooden pillars. The nectar is in a 
      chest guarded by a Drudge Prowler over by a table to the left<span lang="en-us">

      built the distillery, but it must be very old. The stuff we have tried 
      making isn't as good as some of the mysterious stuff we found in it.&quot;<br>
      Lord Aleval tells you, &quot;At the very bottom is a cellar where the best 
      ancient drinks were found. The key I gave you earlier should open it. If 
      you bring me back a bottle of distillery ambrosia, I will reward you

      <br>
      To get to the cellars, return to the room which had the Nectar Chest. Head 
      to the far back wall, and you'll find the locked door. Use the Key From 
      Aleval to open the door, then head down to the lower levels. You'll be
