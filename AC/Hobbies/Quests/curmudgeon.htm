event. This live event initally took place on the Verdantine server on Jan. 19, 2005.</font></span><p>

<br>
Seeing as you were part of this, I wanted to share it with you. I had your site 
up the whole time on another PC for the quest guide.<br>
<br>
Curmudgeon the Drudge Arrived in Holtberg on VT asking for help to do a “Kwest” 
several of us stepped up to help. Hush, Ratty, Duroth, Illusive Jade II, Sweth, 
Bunny Master and myself (Hamfast) helped Curmudgeon the Drudge do the Elysa’s 
favor quest. For helping him do the quest we each received the title 
“Curmudgeon’s Friend” and a Special Signed “Drudge Board with Nail”. Because I 
had Buffed Curmudgeon and kept him alive, he deemed me his “Special Friend” and 
gave me his most prized possession, his Huggy Drudge Doll.<br>
<br>
Attached are some Screen shots, I hope they are of use<br>

Curmudgeon appeared again, this time on MT! Thanks also to Aka-hung!</font></span></p>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Curmudgeon the Drudge wandered 
into Hebian-To at approx 7pm on January 19. He asked me for help in getting a 
necklace (Baron's Amulet) for his friend. I of course recruited everyone I could 
find to help!<br>
<br>
Participants included: Goddes', Kanumi, I C E, Green Turtle, Aka-Hung, Anxietor, 
Xisle Desoul, Joten, IzzyKatt, and Dandee. Out of our group Xsile Desoul 
received the Huggy Drudge Doll. In the end we all got hugs and Curmudgeon went 
back to Shoushi to give Nen Ai the amulet. I'm betting she was a very happy 
drudge when he got home!<br>
<br>
You already have screenshots of the title and the doll. I have included 
screenshots of the inscribed board as well. Also the the beginning of our quest, 
where he first asked me for help. And a screenshot of the Doll on the ground.</font></span></p>

<br>
Allow me to first say that I love your site. I'm sorry I don't have a chat log 
or a very clear story, but it was a very hectic time getting this quest done. I 
hope that I can accurately relate the events enough though.<br>
<br>
Thursday night, around 11 PM eastern, some friends and I portalled to Aphus 
Lassel to kill Mowen. In the town, we noticed a drudge wandering around. His 
name was &quot;Curmudgeon the Drudge&quot; and he was an admin/+Leo/Dev roleplaying with 
us. In perfect and unbroken drudge speak (which is similar to a young child's 
speech, see the inscriptions on the items in the screenshots that I am sending), 
he asked us for help and protection. It turns out that he wanted to get a Doll 
Leader's Charm for his wife as a gift, but took the wrong portal (He never said 
the name of the item, but I was able to figure it out) and had ended up at Aphus 
Lassel. After listening to his story about being afraid of the &quot;Shiny faces&quot; 
(Dolls) and the &quot;Ebul Drudge wif Shiny face&quot; (virindi altered drudges, such as 
Raveners), I started to run to get a portal tie for him.<br>
<br>
Well, just as I got the nearest tie to the Singular Pyreal Repository, someone 
came along and killed Curmudgeon. He was not accepting @tell messages, so we 
thought all was lost. However, about 10 minutes later, Curmudgeon gives me an 
@tell saying that a &quot;Bad man cause me much hurt, make go through swirly&quot;. I 
reply to him that I've got a ride for him and inquire to his location. He 
doesn't know the name of the town he is in (Hey, drudges can't read town signs), 
but he is in a beach town. I check Eastham and Mayoi, but no Curmudgeon. I ask 
him if there's anything else he can tell me, and he mentions a tasty apple pie. 
This tips me off that he's in Yaraq, so I meet him. My fellowship (Badangel, 
Osato Cin, Thengil, Tanyia and I), guide him along the run, killing everything 
in our path to protect him. We get to the dungeon and it turns out the he 
actually needs us to take him through the entire quest. This gets a bit hairy, 
but we get him to the end, and he gets the bracelet for his wife. He then 
portals us back to Yaraq, thanks us many times, and just before he leaves, he 
offers to give us rewards. He gave everyone in my fellow a Drudge Board with 
Nail that he inscribed with a personal thank you for each person. He then says 
that since I led him so well that he has a special gift for me. He gave me a &quot;Huggy 
Drudge Doll&quot;. It looks different that other pack drudges (see screenshot), has a 
special description and an inscription from him. Also, just before he left, he 
offered to tell the world what we had done. Rather than a global message, he 
decided to give all of us Unique titles (see screenshot) of &quot;Curmudgeon's 
Friend&quot;.
<br>
<br>
I hope I've relayed the story to you well enough, I'm no expert writer or 
storyteller. If you have any questions, feel free to reply.<br>
