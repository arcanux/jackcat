<a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Storm2.htm">A Gathering 
Storm</a>, it was discovered that not all the Hollow Minions were vanquished 
when the Virinidi were. A unique Minion Leader, Dranith Menacet, was residing in 
the Hollow Lair outside Lytelthorpe. </span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF99" size="2" face="Arial">Arcanum Envoy tells you, "Greetings, brave adventurer! Time is short, I fear. We have discovered a delicate situation. While the Virindi have apparently been vanquished, not all of their minions have followed suit."&nbsp;<br>
    Arcanum Envoy tells you, "There is a crazed Hollow Minion, who calls himself Dranith Menacet, residing at the end of these tunnels. We have never heard of a hollow who possesses an individual name. I hope this is the worst of the surprises we face in the near future."&nbsp;<br>
    Arcanum Envoy tells you, "Nuhmudira preserve us. If you are able to reach and vanquish Dranith, please see if he has left anything of note behind. The Arcanum is extremely interested in getting at the root of this problem. According to the Arcanum, portalspace disruptions around the nine Arrival towns are increasing daily.

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">After brave

</font></p>
    <p align="left">
    <font color="#99FF99" face="Arial" size="2">A flash of purple light streaks through the horizon and you hear a shattering thunderclap in the distance.  A strange hollow voice echoes in your mind, 'Our conquest begins today.  At this point we are merely a rumble.  Soon we will be the thunder that shakes the very flesh off your bones.  Our time is soon, human.  Very soon.'  The voice fades away, leaving you with a dizzying headache.</font>
    <p align="left"><font color="#99FF99" face="Arial" size="2">Your assault sends Dranith Menacet to an icy death!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    You reel as a tremendous shock wave passes through you upon the vanquishing of Dranith Menacet. A horrible din rises up in the background, and then slowly fades away. You hear the voice of Dranith Menacet echo loudly in your mind, 'Do you think this means you've won? Do you really? Our plan has only begun, flesh. This is only the start. Soon you will see what your victory has meant. Empty as the very air. The only victory today is mine.' The voice slowly fades away. You see a piece of white paper lying on the ground.&nbsp;</font><p align="left">
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, of course, Dranith Menacet 
can be found in the Hall of Hollows beneath Fort Witshire, albeit less powerful 
than before. However, his note remains in the Hollow Lair and can be used to 
obtain Writ of Refuge, used to purchase a dwelling or to pay rent on one. </font>
</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin the 
quest for a Writ of Refuge, speak to an Agent of the Arcanum.</font></span></p>

<font color="#99FF99">Agent of the Arcanum smiles at you gently.<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF99">Agent of the Arcanum tells you, &quot;You have done much 
to help us. Your sacrifice and actions assisted Nuhmudira in her darkest hour 
and we thank you for those efforts.&quot;<br>
Agent of the Arcanum tells you, &quot;If you have not yet done so, seek out Balthazar 
outside of Lin. He will instruct you on how you may further aid us.&quot;<br>
Agent of the Arcanum tells you, &quot;Housing continues to be provided through a 
joint effort of the Arcanum and the High Queen. Writs are required for these 
domiciles. We will still accept any of the following in trade for writs: Any of 
the four elemental prisms, Nuhmudira's Token, Regular or Quality Pyreal Ingots, 
and Diamond Powder. We also have need now of Niffis Pearls. Once you possess a 
Writ of Refuge, seek out a Covenant Stone and determine what else is needed to 
purchase your homestead. Also of note are new dwellings that have been opened 
that offer a more communal living arrangement.&quot;</font><br>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira's Token

the Arcanum Envoy who explains that you must make a choice. You can either 
exchange the paper with an Agent of the Arcanum for the Token (1 time only per

Shop below!<br>

<font color="#FFFF99">Arcanum Envoy tells you, &quot;Greetings, brave adventurer! 
Time is short, I fear. We have discovered a delicate situation. While the 
Virindi have apparently been vanquished, not all of their minions have followed 
suit.&quot;<br>
Arcanum Envoy tells you, &quot;There is a crazed Hollow Minion, residing at the end 
of these tunnels. We have never seen such a tenacious hollow minion commanding 
troops before. I hope this is the worst of the surprises we face in the near 
future.&quot;<br>
Arcanum Envoy tells you, &quot;Nuhmudira preserve us. If you are able to reach and 
vanquish the Hollow Minion, please see if he has left anything of note behind. 
The Arcanum is extremely interested in getting at the root of this problem.

Please give it to me, and I will give you in exchange a token from Nuhmudira. 
She has instructed her Agents to give a Writ of Refuge in return for this token.

this portal beside me, where you can purchase interesting items of decor for 
your home.&quot;<br>

</font><font color="#FFFF99">Arcanum Envoy tells you, &quot;You may use this token in 
one of two ways. First, you may deliver it to an Agent of the Arcanum, and they 
will reward you with a Writ of Refuge. But be aware that they will only do this 
once. After that, they will have no need of these tokens from you.&quot;<br>
Arcanum Envoy tells you, &quot;The alternative is to give me back the token. I will 
then permit you to enter the portal next to me. You will there see a furniture 
vendor who has unique items to sell you for your house. Choose your desire with 
care.&quot;</font></font></span></p>

a strange stick, whatever that is for, but this... finally! Solid evidence of 
wrong doing on the plateau!&quot;<br>
Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Wait... what was I getting so excited over? This is 
just some amulet caked in carenzi refuse. Hardly proof of anything. You know 
what? I am so tired of people bringing me dead ends and fallacies! Here! Just 
take this!&quot;</font><br>
