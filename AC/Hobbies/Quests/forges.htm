this post</a> by meanbeard for important information about the forge XP reward.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Lugians are not giving level 126ers the 
appropriate XP reward because of a bug introduced during the final days of 
implementation. I would like to apologize to you for that bug.<br>
<br>
I still want to give level 126ers the amount of XP you should have received for 
this quest. So, next month, take your Western Forge Essence to an Agent of the 
Arcanum. They will give you the appropriate XP reward. This reward will only be 
given once and will no longer be available once we publish the February event. 
If you have already given your Western Forge Essence to a Lugian, you will need 
to do finish this quest again. Of course, keep in mind that if you have already 
picked up a Western Forge Essence, you have to wait 30 days before you can pick 
up another one.<br>
<br>
To be clear, the Agents will only reward XP for the Western Forge Essence, and 
they will only reward that XP to level 126ers.&quot;<br>
