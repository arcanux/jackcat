        <font size="2">Chupon's Savoir, Emo II, Ussj Vin, Mystykal, Jaguar, 
        Silenced, and Morgan Wulfson Jr just killed the Harbinger on LC.<br>
        <br>
        Get flagged by talking to the virindi in Yanshi, retrieving one of the 
        items from his book, and returning it to him. You are then flagged to 
        enter.<br>
        <br>
        The dungeon is straightforward. Just keep going down, hacking through 
        rooms full of high level sclavi and tentacles. Be warned! They 
        chain-harm and cast Life Bolts. LOTS of harms :) Also some 
        dual-elementals and standard elementals. Nothing too scary.<br>
        <br>
        There are a few simple jumps, just jump straight across, and watch where 
        you're going to land. As far as we could tell, there's only one way 
        through the dungeon, unless you count going for an acid bath as a viable 
        route of travel ;)<br>
        <br>
        Once you get to the Harbinger, he is surrounded by elementals. There's a 
        reasonably safe buffing spot above him (just a few elementals that spawn 
        up there), and you can debuff him and his cronies.<br>
        <br>
        Once you jump down, you'd best have some folks in your group as 
        dedicated healers. He hits hard and fast, and casts a lot of very nasty 
        debuffs and wars. Quick trips to the lifestone for anyone that's not 
        well prepared :)<br>
        <br>
        Our group used Pierce, which seemed to work well. His magicd isn't very 
        high - I was able to land on him with 340ish Life skill.<br>
        <br>
        When he dies, he leaves behind a number of arms. Grab one and give it to 
        Asheron's Emmisary outside for a &quot;Champion of Dereth&quot; title. Talking to 
        the virindi will give you 1 point in the skill related to the token you 
        gave him.<br>

        Many of my fellow warriors and I (some from the last harbinger raid) 
        went down and bravely fought our way to the harbinger, it was a long and 
        deadly battle, one of our party members died in a mere moment.... :/ 
        Weight of the world and the other spells he uses Absolutely hurt.<br>
        <br>
        Anyway, we killed the Harbinger (PRISM WEAPONS AND SLASH ARE YOUR BEST 
        WEAPONRY CHOICE), It died. It summoned a portal and left arms (I missed 
        the arms cuz I saw only the portal first heh). Went back to the Virindi 
        Outside (via portal) and he granted me 1 point into my sword (from the 
        Mutilator head I turned in.)<br>

        <font size="2">Info on Jumps</font><p align="left">
       
        <font size="2">I thought I would send this along to you, because my 
        allegiance did the quest last night, and we had a lot of people either 
        die or recall from the jumping.<br>
        <br>
        So far on the quest write-up it just says ... &quot;There are a few simple 
        jumps, just jump straight across, and watch where you're going to land.<br>
        <br>
        I thought this might be a little more enlightening for those still new 
        to the quest and don't know what to expect like our group.<br>
        <br>
        We all talked to Vincadi and went in that dungeon.<br>
        <br>
        At the first jump the opening is in the middle of the wall. At the 
        bottom is a fire pit. You can do a full jump, but keep the &quot;forward key&quot; 
        pressed down - you will hit the wall and drag yourself into the hallway. 
        It worked for me twice, but I am not sure if lag will mess it up. If you 
        don't make the jump, there is no way out other than recalling.<br>
        <br>
        The second jump our group didn't have a problem with both times. You 
        just do a 1/4 power jump down to the North. If you do a full jump, you 
        will over jump to the other side. If that happens it's not a problem, 
        just quickly run back around facing to the North again. Although it is 
        very hard to see in this area from all the effects.<br>
        <br>
        The third jump incorporates 3 jumps. All will be to the North. The first 
        jump you do a shift jump with about 1/4 power (this can be overjumped 
        for dire consequences). The next jump can be done with full power and 
        the same with the last jump. If you land in the fire pit on the last 
        jump, you will have to recall out.<br>
        <br>
        On the fourth jump you will want to do a shift jump with about 1/4 
        power, it is not as crucial, but it lines you up better to run thru the 
        acid to the South. Once you make it thru the acid and in the hallway to 
        the South - move away from the edge. We lost a couple people thinking 
        they were safe just inside the hallway past the acid.<br>
        <br>
        For a group new to the quest and doesn't know what to expect from the 
        jumps I would recommend people jumping down one at a time, with a healer 
        constantly healing them. The healer should be the last one down, but on 
        the fourth jump beware of the respawning elementals. During the jumping 
        the healer should be different from the usual healer(s), it should be 
        someone with experience leading, jumping and that can improvise.<br>
        <br>
        At the last jump before the Harbinger room, you can jump down safely and 
        are able to vuln and debuff everything in the Harbinger room. 2-3 
        elementals will then spawn in this area, but its not too bad. Once they 
        are all debuffed you can then run thru the fire and jump down into the 
        Harbinger room for your final confrontation. <br>

        Well, it was a usual Friday night when I was in Serac, and all of a 
        sudden there was Broadcast message that a portal from Elysa opened in 
        Yanshi.... So I and the whole server went to Yanshi... lag was bad. 
        Anyway, there where different portals: 10-20, 21-30, 31-50, etc. I went 
        in the 80+ side and there was this huge Ursuin Looking thing called the 
        Harbinger. Never got to ID or see what I was doing cause of lag. But we 
        killed it in about 10-15 min. So yes he was hard.</font><p align="left">
