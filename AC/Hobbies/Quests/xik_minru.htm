	&quot;Please, bold one! Would you help me find my husband Geowulf the 
	Stonehearted? It has been weeks since he left and I am worried something 
	awful may have happened to him!&quot;<br>
	Branwyn tells you, &quot;I am sorry. I should know to behave better in front of 
	those who would help me.&quot;<br>
	Branwyn tells you, &quot;One morning, Geowulf and I had an argument, over some 
	silly little thing now that I think upon it. He wanted to move closer to 
	Glenden Wood to be near his ailing father. I love Geowulf's father dearly, 
	but Arwic has been so profitable for my small floral business that I 
	couldn't fathom leaving. I suppose I could commute, but at the time the 
	thought didn't even enter my mind.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Branwyn sniffles slightly and sounds as if she is on 
	the verge of breaking into tears once again.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Branwyn tells you, &quot;We... we fought, and he grew angry 
	and left. On his way he took his hiking pack and canteen and I have not seen 
	him since.&quot;<br>
	Branwyn tells you, &quot;He would at times hike along the western reach he's of 
	the Lost Wish range, and he always made certain to stop along the northern 
	coast to take in the ocean view. I couldn't stand the hike, but I would 
	often meet him at the Haliana settlement and we would walk the beach 
	together.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Branwyn fights back another surge of tears and 
	continues with her story.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Branwyn tells you, &quot;I ... just I... oh Geowulf!&quot;<br>
	Branwyn tells you, &quot;Please find my husband! Start your search along the 
	northern coast near that settlement I told you of. Please find him, bring me 
	good news of my beloved!&quot;<br>
	</font><br>
	If you are too low a level to do the quest, she simply says the following:</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Branwyn tells you, &quot;Oh

	would have you do be far beyond your grasp.&quot;</font><br>

	overwhelms her once again.</font></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Retracing the steps of the missing Geowulf 
	will lead you to the Vissidal Isle and the Temple of Xik Minru -

	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Inside you're greeted by

	<p><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">The ancient golem turns towards you and makes a

	<p><font face="arial" size="2" face="arial">Details from anonymous:</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">There is a floating opaque / translucent step 
	(like the platforms of the BM3 quest) right at the entrance which you 
	can use to 
	jump to reach the lever. When you hit the lever, run up, then turn down on 
	ramp. Hit the lever on your left (where there is a niffis). 
	The door to the next dungeon opens. You'll be fighting various Ghosts and 
	Undead.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">For the next dungeon, there are 4 rooms, 3 of which have levers that you 
	must activate to open the 3 blocking doors. In the 4th room, you'll find the first part of Geowulf's
	Journal spawning on the floor 
	right before the platforms. </font><font face="arial" size="2">If you 
	missed it, you can take any of the four portals on the upper platforms and 
	go south from the room you drop into. Take the first right and go due west 
	and you will shortly come to the room with the ring and journal on the 
	floor, and Geowulf's Ghost in the corner (turn journal in 
	to Branwyn for about 8.1 million xp).</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">After those 3 levers, you have to open a crypt door 
	and hit the lever inside. The 2nd part of Geowulf's
	Journal is inside a crypt with an open roof, a 
	bit further in the dungeon.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">In the last dungeon, you reach a room with 2 doors (one east, one West), 
	and 2 exits without doors (North, South). Take the South hallway to find the 
	3rd part of the journal, right by Geowulf's corpse and ring. His ghost 
	floats around, but he doesn't respond. The north exit is a quick route to the courtyard, 
	but there are a 
	total of 4 ways to reach it (North, South, West, East courtyard portals).</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Text:
	<a href="../../Culture/Texts/geowulf.htm">Geowulf's 
	Journal</a></font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Xik Minru is at the center of the courtyard. She is withered, but has low 
	magic defense against war magic. She self-buffs with life spells (probably 
	armor, anyway it's the blud pro / armor animation). She debuffs with life 
	7s, and shoots war spells. She is completely invulnerable to acid, 
	lightning, fire, cold (0 damage on crits). She is vulnerable to slash and 
	pierce. I forgot to test bludgeon!! I tried to kill her with a rending wand; 
	there is just no way because of her high regeneration rate, and she can't be 
	festered. Other than killing her, the quest is entirely soloable.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Xik Minru drops a key for a loot chest 
	and an Unreadable Falatacot Volume.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Use the key on one of the chests for 
	Pigmentation Apparatus - dye that can be used on Blackmire Armor! Players 
	have reported different colors coming from the same chest, so it appears as 
	if the color you receive is random.</font></p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">Note: using the malfunctioning apparatus will 
	not lower the AL of the armor.<br>
	<br>
	The undeads drop offerings that can be turned 
	in to the Shrines to (at 
	the top of the flying temple) for 50,000 xp.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">X-al-ko-holic from FF sends these 
	additional details: &quot;Ok, Once you get to the top and you're outside, 
	there are 4 groups of each of 
	the 4 diff type of undead, and also 4 shrines. To spawn the High priestess, 
	you must kill the undead until
	you find an Offering to 
	the High Priestess Xik Minru.The one I found looked like the butterfly necklace, 
	not sure if there 
	are different ones. Anyway, I then used the offering on the shrine and it spawned 
	the Priestess! The spawn on the lower undead guys is pretty slow,
	so if you 
	wipe most of them out you won't be swarmed when fighting her. </font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Now, a few pointers 
	on the High Priestess herself! Despite the whole server telling me she 
	couldn't be soloed, I tried anyway, lol. BIG mistake! 
	She has 50,000 Hps and 
	regens like BOBO! I'm not a capped mage yet, but
	I'm like 3 points away on 
	life/critter and I couldn't land a single yield/vuln on her, so
	I'm guessing 
	she's life/critter invulnerable.
	I landed wars on her like crazy though and hot 
	for... you guessed it: 0's with 
	fire/acid/lightning/and frost!<br>
	<br>
	You can only damage her with slash/bludge or pierce. Pierce seemed to do the 
	best. I landed over 15 wars on her for 250ish and her being at 100% hps still 
	gave me the will to give up on this one until I get some back up. 
	Oh and don't worry 
	about all the levers part.
	If you hit
	them all, it seems to open the 
	doors you need, no order or anything. Hope this 
	helps other people wanting to dye their blackmire armor! Have fun all! Laters&quot;.<br>
	<br>
	You'll get about 8 million for each of the 2 first parts of the journal, and 
	16 for the last part when you give them to Branwyn.<br>

	Timer: 21 days on 3 journal parts
