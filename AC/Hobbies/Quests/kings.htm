    You're prolly getting flooded with info and pics of Reeshan, but here's my 
    little contribution. Pic of his stats and his corpse, pic of his corpse also 
    shows the pieces of flesh that fall in the middle of the room (so not ON or 
    NEAR his corpse) in the background.<br>
    <br>
    He seemed to love to pick a victim, debuff the hell out of him/her for 10 
    minutes, then go to the next one. I didn't notice any straight melee 
    attacks, though he did seem to follow me around the room when I was the pick 
    of the moment. If you are, you cant do much but run around in circles 
    sucking health potions, and hoping the others kill him before he kills you 
    :).<br>

    also casts spells that reduce any stam/mana/health regains, don<span lang="en-us">'</span>t 
    remember the names. Also he casts fellowship debuffs that cut your health,

    <br>
    I was just reading your site on the new Quest &quot;Return of Reeshan&quot;. There is 
    only one way to perfectly answer the riddle each time. Here's how it works<br>
    <br>
    Pull a marble from the Black and White Bag (Mix)<br>
    <br>
    If you receive a Black Marble Back<br>
    The Mix Bag gets the Black Marbles<br>
    The White Bag gets the Mix Marbles<br>
    The Black Bag gets the White Marbles<br>
    <br>
    If you receive a White Marble Back<br>
    The Mix Bag gets the White Marbles<br>
    The White Bag gets the Black Marbles<br>
    The Black Back Bag gets the Mix Marbles<br>
    <br>
    The above is the only true way to get past it on the first time. Seems 
    Turbine may be getting a little tricky with their riddles ;)<br>

    Brimstone Sniper of TD</font><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">From Phades of DT:</font><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">Ok. We went there on DT with about 6 people... 
	hah. Reeshan laughed at us.<br>
	<br>
	Every weapon type does hardly any damage. You'll need burun slayers...which 
	still do garbage damage, but double the damage of non burun slayers.<br>
	<br>
	So everyone do the Burun slayer quest or get double the people to make up 
	for it.<br>
	<br>
	6 of us were like 4 guys attempting to kill a tremendous monouga when they 
	first came out...<br>
	<br>
	Go to BM5. Drop down and talk to the Watcher of the dead(looks like a 
	ghost). <br>
	<br>
	When you drop down, jump down to the lowest lvl. Take passage on the EAST 
	wall that leads up.<br>
	<br>
	Take the first Left that you can heading West. Button on the wall to first 
	flood room. Big Heads at SW.. Farthest SW big head has a pressure switch 
	under it. Step on the plate and go through the door that opens just next to 
	the head on the SW wall corner.<br>
	<br>
	Next flood room, make your way to the SW corner again. Button on wall will 
	open the next door.<br>
	<br>
	Run down the hallway till you get to a split. Make a left at the button 
	(push it to open passage way). Keep heading left till you get to the next 
	flood room.<br>
	<br>
	In the flood room on the EAST side is a doorway with a pressure switch in 
	front of it. Open up that passage and pull the lever, run out the room and 
	head left to the SOUTH opened passage. Follow upwards making lefts and till 
	you get to a button and door just before the Gateway. Use the gateway to get 
	to next section.<br>
	<br>
	Next section has a test. 3 bags and a directions sign. Answer changes 
	everytime. To get through, talk to the directions and then click on the left 
	bag to get a marble. From left to right put your marbles in the bags: Mixed, 
	Black, White.<br>
	<br>
	If you didn't get the passing message, then talk to directions and do it 
	over and over till you do. May take a few tries. when you get approved, use 
	the exit gateway to get to the next section. (You only ever have to do this 
	once. If you die and come back, you can just run to the exit portal.)<br>
	<br>
	Last section is a HUGE MAZE. But.. really easy. Lots of dead ends but if you 
	want to go through the fastest and easy way then... Go left, then left... 
	then left.. then left... etc... Stick to the left wall making lefts the 
	entire way, up, down ramps..whatever. You'll find yourself taking the 
	fastest route to the next Portal Gateway.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">A violent hum sounds in your head and you are drawn 
	unceremoniously into portal space.<br>
	Portal Gateway teleports you with Center of Izji Qo's Temple.</font><br>
	<br>
	Say Hi to Reeshan. He debuffs like mad and will eat you randomly. If you get 
	eaten, you'll appear in his stomach. There are 4 walls. Pick one, vuln it 
	and hack/cast away. Careful of acid damage as you do your work. After you do 
	enough damage, the wall will teleport you outside to the fight again.<br>
	<br>
	He also teleports you away and gives you vitae. You don't lose items, but 
	you get vitae and leave the area. This happened to 1 of our guys. There were 
	only 6 of us. Heh.. enjoy and keep your Burun Slayers handy...<br>

	<font face="Arial" size="2">From Deven-Kenyon of SC:</font><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2">Hey there maggie! <br>
	<br>
	Well, here it is, a lil walkthrough to help peeps along on this new quest. 
	I'll post it on my blackmire site as well with pics<br>
	<br>
	King Reeshan walkthrough. Thanks to Rare-to, Guil ty, and Counterspell for 
	their imput and help.<br>
	<br>
	Note: Bring at least a full fellow (made up of mostly archers and mages, 
	although melee's are needed for killing burun through the doors, they have 
	little impact on Reeshan himself at the end.)<br>
	<br>
	This quest starts at the Temple of Izji Qo (Blackmire 5 temple located at 
	12.7S 58.8W) (You can either use the Izji Qo hooked portal you got on 
	Blackmire 3, or you can run from Fort Tethana). The temple statue is still 
	down inside, but there's now a new inhabitant, a Watcher of the Dead. 
	Instead of using the statue, talk to the Watcher.<br>
	<br>
	After you speak to the watcher of the dead... <br>
	<br>
	Watcher of the Dead tells you, &quot;My purpose is plain, I watch the dead that 
	reside within the halls of this temple. I have stood this vigil since my 
	sacrifice over thirty thousand years ago, when the world cooled and the 
	darkness made war upon all. The weight of time has long crushed my bones to 
	dust and left with me with this incorporeal form. Yet, I serve my purpose 
	with the same vigor that I did in life.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Watcher of the Dead tells you, &quot;A threat, not of this world grows within the 
	belly of this temple. They have come from across the stars, across the 
	divide between our worlds with one thought in their ravenous minds; 
	destruction.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Watcher of the Dead tells you, &quot;Their pilgrimage is for naught, there are no 
	sisters left upon this world who draw breath, there are none who recall the 
	glory of Golden Shores and the valley wherein Ualannan once held vigil 
	watching over all our sisters. All is dust, but this will not deter these 
	beasts from another world.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Watcher of the Dead tells you, &quot;They come and they shall spread their rot to 
	the core of this world and there it shall grow unfettered until all is 
	consumed and destroyed. You must destroy the beasts within the deepest halls 
	of the Izji Qo's temple. They have found passage within and slaughtered or 
	consumed all souls that have stood against their trespass.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	...you'll portal in and have a small drop to a platform below. face east and 
	jump down. take the east ramp up to the first door. there's a pressure plate 
	on the floor as well as a button, so be prepared. hit the button, head in 
	door and go north then head west then north again. go west to another door 
	where there's a big room of burun, fight through the door. The button is 
	located father back on north wall. in this room you'll see two statue heads 
	on the south wall, face them, then turn west. You'll want to take the door 
	to your immediate left past the second head. There are two pressure plates 
	under the heads. <br>
	<br>
	The pressure plate for the South door is under the cloesest head to that 
	South door, pressure plate for N wall door is under the East statue. Hit the 
	plate under the head for the south door and go in. If anyone gets left 
	inside, there's a button on inside wall to open same door. Now follow 
	hallway to the T, take the west passage at the T. The button for this door 
	is on the north wall. kill through the door<br>
	<br>
	Once inside, you'll be in your second large room. there's one head in the 
	n/w corner wall facing you. run south/west to the door on the south wall. 
	follow the hallway to the door. There's a pressure plate towards north end 
	of hall facing door on south wall. There's also a button on other side to 
	reopen for friends.<br>
	<br>
	Follow hall again north to the door in east hallway. There's a button and 
	pressure plate. Follow around and up heading south to the lever room. The 
	lever is in a room on west wall, it opens a door on south wall. if you're 
	with a fellowship, kill the burun then go inside, if you're trying to make a 
	solo run, you may have a problem, but it's doable. Circle the burun around 
	so they don't all clog the doors, then head to west lever, there's a 
	pressure plate right outside the door that'll open it. You’ll probably get 
	stuck here killing lots of burun through the door. Kill them first, hit the 
	lever, then get out of the <br>
	<br>
	Room and head to the south door. Make your first right after door, go right 
	again after that. Head east and up two ramps. You’ll be in the portal device 
	room. Use the device<br>
	<br>
	A violent hum sounds in your head and you are drawn unceremoniously into 
	portal space.<br>
	<br>
	This next area is the marble puzzle room. Talk to the sign in east alcove, 
	you'll be handed three containers with marbles in them, one is black, one's 
	white and the third is mixed. go to the three bags in the west alcove, use 
	the bag with the black and white marbles on it. Now, depending on what 
	marble you pull from the bag, hand it the same color. the two remaining go 
	to the white and black marble bags. Note: black cannot go in black, and 
	white cannot go in white. Once you receive a message you've completed it, 
	you may now access the exit portal to the north. Also, once you complete the 
	marble puzzle the first time, you do not need to re-due it again and you can 
	either rebuff at the marbles or take the exit, the drop is safe<br>
	<br>
	This next area is tricky. Head west into the large room and take the door on 
	the south wall in that room and follow the hall and take the second right 
	heading south. go east to wall and make a left south and then immediately 
	east (another left). Take your next immediate left heading east. Follow that 
	hall, passing rooms and over a ramp similar to g man where you can see 
	through the floor heading through more halls and small rooms. You cannot get 
	lost here. You'll head over another ramp and take your first immediate right 
	after coming out of that hall. Keep north then turn right (east). Keep 
	heading east to wall, take left (north) and go down ramp. You’ll be in an 
	open room, head south and run all the way south to and up a ramp. Take a 
	left and follow west. Take another left then an immediate right, then left 
	again and head down the ramp west into another room. The portal device is in 
	a room on the west wall. do not use it until everyone is ready. The drop is 
	HOT. You'll be facing the same burun but an added bonus, King Reeshan 
	himself! He's a cutie :D And he's very hungry. If you get swallowed by him, 
	quickly move to one of the four sides of the stomach and attack it, 
	eventually he'll spit you out. Mages have a harder time in here, but keep at 
	it, you will get out.<br>
	<br>
	Don't debuff him! If you do, he's that much harder to kill, and he starts 
	throwing around worse debuffs at you. If your health is debuffed, I'd 
	suggest getting away from him asap. The debuffs don't last long and you can 
	jump right in and fight again. Use your melee's to keep him in line, your 
	archers to do the most damage, and your mages to keep everyone alive. Also 
	infusing them with stam when they ask wouldn’t hurt.<br>
	<br>
	Once he's dead (this takes a very long time, make sure you're well prepared 
	for this quest! Two plats is NOT going to cut it) he'll drop hides 
	everywhere on the floor. They look like sacks. Grab one, collect any victims 
	from the floor as well, and head to cragstone where you have a nice chat 
	with Guard Ellyon for your reward, which has been noted as random. This is 
	where you obtain the new mansion portals. This current one goes to one of 
	the three bsd's (it's a random portal each time). You also get gems to imbue 
	weapons and burun armor. If you plan on doing this quest more than once, 
	then hand in the hide for a title of Reeshan Killer. If not, hold on to it, 
	as there will be more hides to add to it for a reward later on.<br>
	<br>
	Hope this guide has helped you, and feel free to ask for a personal run 
	through if you're on SC :)<br>

    the global for the 2nd wave of king spawn and we are at the trivia part as I 
    write this. It's a little different than the Reshaan one. Now it makes you 
    pick up clue cards, and there are also corresponding balls (answers) to 
    solve the puzzle. For mine, I got &quot;It makes you sad&quot; or something to that 
    effect. My answer was the Blue Ball. I guess blue balls makes people sad. 
    &lt;snicker&gt;. Anyways, I will post more. Oh and by the way, the path is

    war upon all. The weight of time has long crushed my bones to dust and left 
    with me with this incorporeal form. Yet, I serve my purpose with the same

    Watcher of the Dead tells you, &quot;Within the halls of High Matriarch Ixir Zi's 
    resting place grows a threat long thought gone. When first the worlds were 
    closed and we passed through tunnels of sound and light we wrested the world 
    from their grasp. They seek vengeance upon those who no longer draw breath.&quot;
