    helpful to me, perhaps you could also help Flinrala. She doesn't talk about 
    it much, but she still grieves for her father, Brogord. He died defending 
    the Redoubt.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;One of his axes is rumored to be in the Cave of Alabree, 
    a bit west of here. Perhaps you could go and take a look? Bring anything you 
    find back to Flinrala - I'm sure she'll be happy to have it.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;Here, here are the directions. Wilomine also sells them, 
    in case you lose those.&quot;</font><br>

      32.0E and is restricted to Levels 1-20. Inside
      Blood Shreths roam the winding passageways. It's very easy to get lost  as you search for the Armory where Brogord's Axe now rests.<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Before heading to the 
    Cave, you may want to bind yourself to the Holtburg Lifestone. You can 
    also purchase protective gems from Novideon the Gem Seller and services from 
    the local healer.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin, you have the choice of going left, right or straight. Go straight and take the right corridor at your first intersection. The passage ends in a "T" just past a room with a Shreth guarding a chest. Take the right turn and you'll go down a level to a large cavern with two more shreths. 
      From the cavern take the first left. Make a right at the next 
      intersection. You'll see a room off to the side. Pick 
      up the note spawning on the floor.</font><p>

      take the left passage. It will wind around until you see the Armory door 
      on the right. Brogord's Axe, a former trophy of the Tumerok invasion, is lying in the middle of the Armory floor.<br>
      <br>
      If you choose the right split at that last intersection instead of the 
      left, you'll find a steep ramp heading down. At the bottom a
      Hunter Shreth and a few 
      Bloods guard a pretty nice chest with some good newbie loot. If you stop for your mighty axe first, you can backtrack and take them out with little problem!</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">As tempting as it may be to keep this fine axe, remember that Flinrala Ryndmad, orphaned as a baby during the Tumerok 
      siege, sought the recovery of the axe in memory of her brave Father. If 
      you return it to her, she'll give you a nice reward!</font><p>

      axe of my own, as soon as I was big enough to hold one ...&quot;<br>
      Flinrala Ryndmad tells you, &quot;I'm sorry ... I just miss him still ...&quot;<br>
      Flinrala Ryndmad tells you, &quot;No, no, I'm okay ... Allow me to reward you. 
      It's the least I can do, really.&quot;</font><br>

      from my father to my mother? ... oh! And he wrote it in the Redoubt, as he 
      was waiting for the end to come. This is ... I cannot speak ... It is so 
      kind of you, to return this to me. To read his last words ...&quot;<br>
      Flinrala Ryndmad tells you, &quot;No, no, I'll be alright. It just overwhelms 
      me sometimes, how much I miss him. I must reward you for this.&quot;</font><br>
