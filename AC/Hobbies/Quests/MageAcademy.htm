<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">What used to be 
considered one of the most über chests in the game lies at the bottom of the 
Mage Academy. To open it, you'll need to collect a series of keys and puzzle 
your way through some of the most complicated levers in the game.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin, speak 
to Tazal al-Ashfai, a Planar Mage outside of Al-Jalima, at 6.1N, 3.5E.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#FFFF99">Tazal al-Ashfai tells you, &quot;Hail, traveler. It is pleasant 
to meet anyone here in the wastes. Tell me, have you discovered a crypt in these 
regions called the Burial Temple?&quot;<br>
Tazal al-Ashfai tells you, &quot;I have heard that the dead walk there, and one in 
particular always carries a certain black gem I seek for my research.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<b>Burial Temple</b><br>
The Burial Temple is located quite nearby at 8.5N, 6.0E (no level restrictions - 
previous level restriction of 5-10 was removed).</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Map:
<a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.com/map.php?id=013E">Burial Temple</a></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the entrance 
you'll be on a raised platform. Jump towards the east, then take the  south 
passage straight ahead until you pass through a false wall at the dead end. Head down 
the ramp.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the three way 
intersection go straight. You'll battle a few
<a href="../../Pets/skeleton.htm">Skeleton Warriors</a> 
along the way. At the T go right heading west. Bear left around the circular 
room until you see the lever near the wall. Pull the lever, then continue 
heading left. Go through the sarcophagus room heading left again, then down a 
ramp. At the bottom, you'll see the door that the lever opened.<br>
<br>
Inside you'll find a <a href="../../Pets/skeleton.htm">
Skeleton Lord</a> who carries a Black Gem and a Cursed Key. You can kill the 
Lord as many times as you want for more than one key and gem, but be warned! The 
Cursed Key is 1000 burden and no-drop. To exit, use the lever behind the altar 
to 
re-open the door and take the surface portal nearby.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Return to Tazal 
al-Ashfai and hand him the gem. He'll open a portal to the Mage Academy at 
74.7N, 18.5E (Restricted to levels 8+). You can also run to the Mage Academy by 
taking the Dagger Vale
<a href="../../Travel/portals2.htm">settlement portal</a> 
from Arwic (</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">32.9N, 59.4E<span lang="en-us">) 
which exits at 83.3N, 28.8E. The entrance portal to the Mage Academy may be tied to.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#66FF99">You give Tazal al-Ashfai Black Gem.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Tazal al-Ashfai tells you, &quot;Wonderful! Can you see the 
portal energy pulsing within it? I have heard stories that the ancient dead of 
Dereth talk to each other as we do, and form a society underneath our own...&quot;<br>
Tazal al-Ashfai says, &quot;Let us see where this one liked to travel.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Mage Academy</b><br>
When you go through the portal, you'll enter suspended in the air and will fall a short distance. 
You should take a few minutes to explore the corridors before starting the quest 
to familiarize yourself with several important locations. First, take note of 
the lever 
to your right next to the surface portal.  </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next explore the 
left corridors. If you continue taking lefts all the way down, 
you'll find a locked gated door with sewer rats behind it (you'll use lockpick 
to open it later). In this room is a 
large metal door that leads to the sewers. Directly across from the rat area is 
a door with a lever behind it. Up one level to the right is the zefir/golem 
area. Head back to the top and explore the right passages.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the entry 
take the right corridor down to the area with several doors. Find the one that's 
locked with a resistance of 750. Explore the level just above (the one that has 
a gated door which swings open when you approach) and find the locked door 
guarded by the lightning trap. Once you've familiarized yourself with these 
locations, you're ready to begin!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Head back down 
the left passage to the Zefir room. Keep to the right and follow around a few 
turns until you see an alcove with 3 levers: 2 on the walls, one on the floor. 
Kill all the <a href="../../Pets/zefir.htm">Zefirs</a> (Jibrits, 
Kilfs and Zofrits). One of the Kilif (the green ones) carries a Stone Key. 
You'll need this later. Pull the two levers on the walls. They open the door 
that's guarded by the lightning trap in the Banderling area, and another behind 
it. (The floor lever opens the door to the Iron Golem.)</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: It's best 
to do this part with someone else who can wait at the banderling door to hold it 
open. I was unable to get this to work solo. (Maybe I was too slow! ;-)</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you're 
through the lightning trap door, you'll see the 2nd door you opened straight 
ahead. Behind it is a lever. A third locked door is in the middle. The lever to 
open this 3rd door is the one next to surface portal at the entrance of the 
dungeon. Have someone run back 
up to pull it and fight the
<a href="../../Pets/banderling.htm">Banderlings</a> 
inside. The Banderling Captain carries the Old Key.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Before leaving 
this area, pull the lever behind the 2nd door. Then have someone run down the 
left corridor to the door across from the swamp rat area and pull the lever 
within.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Head back to the 
Banderling area and use the Old Key on the 750 resist door. You'll kill a few 
more Banderlings, then pick a locked door (resistance 82). You'll then come to a room 
with a lever guarded by a <a href="../../Pets/golem.htm">
Granite Golem</a>. As long as you pulled your levers earlier, the door to the 
Golem room will be open. The lever in this room opens the metal door to the 
sewers in the Swamp Rat room. (Pick the gate to the rats - resist 82).</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Sewers<br>
</b>You might enjoy exploring the sewers before heading further in. There's a K'nath 
room, a Shadow Room (resist 162), and an Altar of Bael'Zharon (resist 124). Be 
cautious! As you approach the Altar, you'll trigger a Rat Trap!! A door high up 
on the wall opens and a dozen or so Sewer Rats will come jumping down on your 
heads from above!! Eeek! Flying Rats!! </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">While you're 
looking around, the door you really want to find is the locked door with resistance 
of 900. Use the Cursed Key to open it. Head up the ramp and kill the Sandstone 
Golem. You'll fight a few Skeleton Warriors and Captains as you wind your way 
around, and you'll walk through a Fire Trap.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you'd like, 
you can stop and kill the Ice Golems and a Granite Golem in a room behind a 
locked door (resist 124). They guard a level III chest and another unlocked 
chest (I got Health and Stamina potions). The chest area is guarded by traps.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you reach 
the Copper Golem area, you will need to make a jump across to the passage on the 
other side (small tap on the space bar while jumping - not a shift jump). If you 
fall, you'll have to do the lever portion all over again. (Some people skip all 
the lever portions of the quest and jump onto this ramp by first jumping on the 
heads of the Banderlings below, then jumping onto the ledge.)<br>
<br>
You'll dead end at a ledge. Below is a surface portal and a Lich Lord. Be 
careful not to jump too close to the exit!! Head down the ramp and you'll find
<a href="../../Pets/undead.htm">Lord Rytheran</a> (Level 
105 undead) in his library!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">
Lord Rytheran notices Zippo entering his sanctum, and rolls his rotting eyes in 
exasperation.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Kill Lord 
Rytheran and retrieve Rytheran's Key and a Letter from his corpse. The Library 
also contains 2 chests: a SIK chest and another locked chest. </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">
The Dericost lord's body collapses into rot and dust, but a voice in your mind 
sneers, &quot;Pathetic little wretch! I shall rise again soon enough.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Soon enough&quot; is 
a debatable term. The spawn for Lord Rytheran is very long -- rumored to be over 
an hour.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Lady Jaera's 
Tomb</b><br>
Take the surface portal nearby and re-enter the Mage Academy. Head down the left 
side to the Zefir area. Instead of running towards the lever area, head the 
opposite direction until you find the locked door guarded by an Obsidian Golem. 
Use the Stone Key on the door (from the Zefir earlier). Inside is Lady Jaera's 
Tomb. It's guarded by Lightning Traps and 2 more Obsidian Golems on very fast 
spawns. (The golems drop minor loot -- mostly spell components, and give no xp).
</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Use Rytheran's 
Key on the tomb for your not-so-über-anymore phat loot! (I pulled AL180 Yoroi 
Sleeves with Impen III, AL50 Pyreal Chain Guantlets no spells, and a 4-10 Trident with +7 
Melee, +11 Attack, and Def V and BD VI.)</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your final step 
is to head to Zaikhal to have the Letter translated.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">
You give Kuyiza bint Zayi the Translator Letter.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Kuyiza bint Zayi the Translator tells you, &quot;Indeed, this is the runic script of 
old Dericost, a language not used in well over 5000 years. A moment - I shall 
transcribe a copy for you into Roulean.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Kuyiza bint Zayi the 
Translator gives you A Letter.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Kuyiza bint Zayi the Translator tells you, &quot;There you are. This was gained from 
a powerful Revenant you say? He would appear to have been several millenia old! 
I wonder if there are others of his antiquity still walking Dereth?&quot;</font></span></p>
