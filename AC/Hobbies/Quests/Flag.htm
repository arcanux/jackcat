      influence for so long is allowing them to return to a more natural

      here it says that a Loom was recently found in a food cellar at Neydisa

      get it to produce any useable cloth.&quot; <br>
      Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I think our insect friends have provided you 
      with the materials required. You might try seeing if you can get the

      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I'm afraid I find the 
      recent Grievver activity in this valley somewhat unsettling. They seem to 
      guard the area against all other creatures. I've never seen Grievvers

      natural existence. If you think yourself brave enough I would be very 
      grateful to know what they are doing in the far east of the valley.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;This I know for a 
      fact. The Grievvers cannot abide the presence of Olthoi. They will fight 
      fiercely against them whenever the two come in contact. This leads me to 
      believe that the Grievvers and Olthoi share some common origin.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I believe that the Grievvers have a complex 
      social order. I can often see one deferring to another in combat or during 
      feeding. Yet it doesn't appear to be a purely physical hierarchy since 
      I've seen a smaller Grievver receive deferential treatment. Perhaps they 
      also recognize intelligence or magical ability as dominating traits. It's 
      all very interesting!&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I have a theory on how 
      Grievvers perceive the world. They have no evident visual organs, yet they 
      seem to move about quite easily.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;From what I have 
      learned and deduced I believe Grievvers come from the same world as the 
      Olthoi, but unlike the Olthoi they were bent to the will of the Shadows. 
      This undoubtedly changed them in ways I cannot say. Perhaps they used to 
      have eyes, perhaps not, I think they may use magics now to attain a view 
      of the world. If so, they can probably see things that we cannot. Or it 
      may be that they have a heightened sense of smell that which allows them 
      to move about and find prey.&quot;<br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;At some point I may 
      try and get a specimen to dissect to learn more, but my work here is 
      currently more important.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;Grievvers eat whatever they can catch. I see 
      them dragging rabbits, aurochs and other creatures. Yesterday I saw them 
      drag an injured Olthoi to the west of the valley where I expect they have 
      a nest of sorts. Unfortunately many young warriors and mages new to the 
      world also fall prey to the Grievvers out of inexperience.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;What? A minor setback? 
      Ah, yes the lifestones. You wouldn't think that was any worse than the 
      hundreds of other ways we can die and be reborn anew into this world, but 
      Grievvers prefer to eat their food alive I'm afraid. They try to injure 
      their prey and cocoon it for consumption at their convenience. I... I 
      sometimes hear horrible sounds from down their. Be careful here I beg 
      you.&quot;<br>
      </font><br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I recently tried to 
      get recognition at the Arcanum for my work on Grievvers. Do you know what 
      they told me?&quot;<br>
      Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;They said chasing bugs is &quot;just an eccentric 
      hobby&quot; not worthy of funding. Well, I don't need the Queen's backing. I'm 
      sure that my work will bear fruit and prove it's [sic] worth to those

      attract the Grievvers.&quot;<br>

      although that seems rather useless unless you want to catch your lunch... 
      You reactions would be enhanced and you might have senses beyond those we 
      are aware of.&quot;<br>
      Verdentine Magnan tells you, &quot;I know that sounds silly, but I often 
      daydream about such things.&quot; </font></font></span>
