<a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Madness2.htm">Madness of 
Men</a> event.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">A group of 
scholars researching the Order of the Raven Hand set out to explore a newly 
discovered library outside of Zaikhal. Alas, they never returned! Ufet, Prophet 
of Blades seeks word of his missing comrades. Fight your way to the bottom of 
the Decrepit Tower and retrieve two texts and 3 Tassets for rewards.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><a href="../../npc.asp-npcID=1366.html">
<font size="2" face="arial">Ufet, Prophet of Blades</a> - 13.9N, 0.7E</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF99" size="2" face="arial">Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells 
you, &quot;Good Day. My name is Ufet, and I am here to organize the defense of 
Gharu'ndim from the depredations of the renegade Tumeroks.&quot;<br>
Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells you, &quot;Queen Elysa has called for volunteers to 
help investigate the Tumerok training camps near Dryreach. You can pick up a 
news sheet about this menace from the barkeeper.&quot;<br>
Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells you, &quot;If you have already investigated the camps, 
and you have some trophy to prove it, I will gladly reward you. I also accept 
Tumerok insignia.&quot;<br>
Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells you, &quot;You'll pardon me if my mind is on other 
matters today. Several of my comrades have left for a recently discovered 
library north west of this city, but they have not yet returned.&quot;<br>
Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells you, &quot;I am not usually one to worry, but with all 
that has happened of late, assassinations, invasions and an increase in cult 
activity, I can't help but do so.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="arial"><span lang="en-us">Once you've been flagged by 
talking to Ufet, you'll need to find a Crest of the Shagar Zharala on a Shreth 
Gnawed Corpse. This crest is used to gain entry to the dungeon under the Decrepit 
Tower Ufet speaks of. </p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">This is the hardest part of 
this quest for many people. Any group of Malus Shreth may spawn the corpse you need, as long as it's not a 
single shreth. Look for spawns of 2 or 3 together. Once you kill them, another 
shreth or two will spawn, then 2-4 minutes later a corpse appears. Ignore the 
corpses named &quot;corpse&quot; and seek of new group of Malus Shreth if it appears. If 
the corpse is named &quot;Shreth Gnawed Corpse,&quot; you've hit the jackpot! Loot the 
Crest and the Excavation Directions from it. The Shreth Gnawed Corpse may be 
camped for multiple Crests; they will respawn after anywhere from 10 to 20 
minutes.</font></span></p>

<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;Finally! People! People who 
aren't crazed!&quot;<br>
Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;Don't look at me like I'm the crazy one. It's all 
those down below who have gone raving mad! Can you help them?&quot;<br>
Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;Wait, you don't look like a Zharalim. Let me see 
your emblem! No emblem? Then I'm afraid I cannot let you pass. I am not about to 
let more people fall to the madness of this tower!&quot;<br>
Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;If you see any of my brethren in the wilds, be wary 
of them. Chances are they are maddened by whatever is in the depths of this 
place. I fear that in that maddened state, they may have fallen prey to some 
beast. Shreth are all too common in this region.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#66FF99">You give Yalik Ibn Ujsef Crest of the Shagar Zharala.</font><br>
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> <font color="#FFFF99">Yalik Ibn Ujsef

</font>
<font color="#66FF99"><span lang="en-us">Yalik Ibn Ujsef gives you Skeleton Key.</span></font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;Beyond the door are a series of levers. Once you 
pass through the gate they bar, you may not be able to return here, so please 
prepare first.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Yalik Ibn Ujsef tells you, &quot;Also, if you happen to find my 
master in the depths, please let him know I am safe and continuing my duty up 
here.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Give Yalik Ibn Ujsef the crest and he'll give you a Skeleton 
Key (3 uses) in return. Find the button on the wall next to Yalik, use it, then 
use the key on the door opposite Yalik to enter the dungeon. To the north you'll 
find a series of 6 rooms and to the west you'll find another locked door. The 6 
rooms have a series of doors and triggers you must push in a specific order to 
open the wooden door.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The button next 
to Yalik should have opened the door to the NE room. The button inside opens the 
SW door. The order for the next 4 doors will be E (middle), NW, W (middle), SE. 
You'll need to use your [ and ] keys to locate  the buttons; some of them 
are artfully hidden behind tapestries and wall hangings or obscured by objects 
in the room!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Head through the 
now opened door to the west and hug the left wall, ignoring any of the side 
passages. Once you've crossed two bridges, keep to the right and head down a 
ramp. At the bottom of the ramp you'll go through 3 doors, then make a left. The 
Zharalim Master's Journal spawns on the floor in this area.</font></span></p>

<a href="../../Culture/Texts/ZharalimMaster.htm">Zharalim 
Master's Journal</a></font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Head back to the passage you were in before you took the left 
into the Journal area. Continue hugging the right wall until you go down another 
ramp. In the hallway that splits off to the left, pull the lever, continue west 
and follow the corridor and it heads back east over 2 more bridges. As you head 
north, you'll find another locked door. The lever to open it is behind some 
tapestries in a small room down the west hallway.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">You'll now be on 
a catwalk area overlooking a room with some large stone heads. Before jumping 
down, locate the two levers in alcoves off the catwalk: one to the north and one 
to the south. These levers open doors to more lever rooms below (again one to 
the north and one to the south). Pull the upper levers, jump down, then pull the 
levers in the lower rooms. Head through the now open passages to the west. <br>
<br>
Note: before moving forward, make sure everyone grabs the 2nd journal, spawning 
on the floor of the stone head room.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Follow the 
passage west until you reach a large open room with two passages heading down. 
Either of them will get you to the next level. You'll next need to trigger a 
floor panel in a small flaming room. If you took the east passage down from the 
large room the pressure plate room will be straight ahead. If you took the west, 
it will be to your left. The pressure plate in the NW corner of the room opens a 
door down the west hallway.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Once through the 
door, you'll be climbing up more broken stairs. You'll need to make a small jump 
over a missing section and parts of it will be invisible. Once at the top, 
follow the passage to a spiral staircase. The next spiral staircase (to your 
immediate left) is blocked by, yes, another locked door! To open this door, head 
all the way down the hall to the north. You'll be pulling 2 of the 13 levers in 
this room, the first on the right (to open the door on the other side of the 
spiral staircase), and the third from the left on the west wall (or levers 8 &amp;13 
if you're counting from left to right). Watch out for the dispel traps! You can 
hug the wall from the right side to avoid it. </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Another small 
room between your location and staircase should now be open. Pull the lever 
inside and the spiral staircase door will open.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Follow it down to 
the final room where you'll battle 3 named Zharalim: </font></span><font size="2">

Ufet, Prophet of Blades tells you, &quot;You did the world a great justice by
