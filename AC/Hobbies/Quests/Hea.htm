  </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Hea Tumerk Tenepuh
  drops totems than you give to Harelthah. Apparently, he only accepts certain
    tokens at separate times, so you may have to keep checking back to redeem
    yours. You will receive either a Stave of Palenqual, A
  melee Weapon or a Ranged Weapon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A report by Shadymilkman:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First off let me say this quest is almost an exact replica of the "assembling" steps of the SoCS. Like how there is a base and gems, but you can only assimilate 3 gems to the SoCS.<br>
    <br>
    Alright -- your first step is to find a Hea totem. The totem is found off a random spawning tumerok named Hea Temenua. When you kill him you will find a Greenwood haft, Gromnie
    Sinew Bowstring and Hea Totem.<br>
    <br>
    After obtaining his death items return to the Aun village and talk to Aun
    Hareltah.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">He says the following:&nbsp;<br>
    <font color="#99FF99"> Aun Hareltah cocks his head to the side, as if listening to something inaudible.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">"Wind has brought tidings of your deeds, friend. She whispers, '[Player
    Name] has slain the brutal Temepuh, who calls himself Temenua as he hunts your people on the upland. Temenua, who sheds your xuta's blood at the behest of the soulless atua ngamaru.'"<br>
    "This deed is a fiery blaze upon your keh, Isparian, even if you know it not. Should you desire the Stave of Palenqual, give me Temepuh's totem. Now we are pressed, and it is time for us to release the magic of Tonk."<br>
    "But if you do not desire this magical stave, if you would rather have the ranged kalindan or the fighting staff called hoeroa, hold your hand for now.&nbsp;<br>
    I will only reward you once for the butcher's death."<br>
    </font><br>
    So this says if you want to give him the totem now, he will give you the base magic
    item: Stave of Palenqual. However, if you are melee, or bow you may want to wait.<br>
    <br>
    After you receive the base staff you must find 3 out of these 5 totems that you want to use on the base staff.
    Each totem will add different spells on the staff.<br>
    <br>
    Now if you decide NOT to turn the Hea totem in for the Stave of Palenqual, you can
    re-click on him to ask him to make either a staff or a crossbow.<br>
    <br>
    Just like a cycle, first time you click he asks if you want to redeem the totem for the Stave of Palenqual. Click on him again and he will ask if you want Hoeroa of Palenqual.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose the melee staff, he does this:<br>
    Aun Hareltah gives you Hoeroa of Palenqual.<br>
    Be your eyes and mind open, though, for only three of these five boon-totems may be added to the totem of
    Palenqual.<br>
    <br>
    The crossbow stuff is still unknown, so any info would be great.<br>
    <br>
    Hope this helps!<br>

    that's not true. The weapon he offers changes based on what phase of the olthoi queen quest is happening. if the quest
    isn't active he offers the melee staff. Once the quest starts up he switches to offering the mage stave, and then in the final phase he offers the crossbow.<br>

    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Heya Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    Here is a pic of the unusable Kalindan of Palenqual.  Btw, Aun Harelthah doesn't change his position during different phases of the queen's quest, but rather each time after the queen is killed.  When I went in the tent he was pacing back and forth at the back of the tent and there would be a global message saying "Aun Harelthah looks around his town grimly".  This is when he offered the Stave of Palenqual.  After the global message that Evil Mephisto killed the queen, he immediately teleported to the front of the tent where he was on his knees.  This is when he offered the Hoeroa of Palenqual.  After logging back on after supper I was told the queen was killed again and I found Harelthah pacing back and forth at the front of the tent.  This is when I finally got the Kalindan of Palenqual I had been waiting several hours for.  I still can't find any information on the totems to put on it except some key words in the note he gave me that I find interesting.  The note says the Aun Elder Shamen have the totems prepared.  It wouldn't make sense that you would have to kill and Aun to get the totems since they are the ones that give the weapon.  Instead, these 2 sentences tell you what you have to do: "You must seek these boons from (is this a typo?...shouldn't it be for?) them in the fields of this Marescent Plateau, for they have piled their kindling far from here. They bear a heavy weight for our xuta."  (xuta being their race)  Are we supposed to be looking for something on the ground (like the way you find a plant)?  Anyway, hope this helps.  Any information how how to complete this quest would be awesome because I
    don't think anyone has finished any of the 3 items for this quest.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just an update on the hea totem quest.<br>
      <br>
      I was exploring/getting experience with my fletcher/trademule thurfir in a tiny hive (30-50) and killed a BLUE olthio noble (different from the normal purple ones) he dropped a large heavy piece of rubble.<br>
      <br>
      I was unable to id the rubble (the spell bar with true value doesn't light up) so I tried to turn it into the 1st Drummer.<br>
      <br>
      He instructed me to turn it into the NW ring (5th drummer) which I did a few days later when I caught a
      queen's quest in progress and recieved a tonk totem.<br>
      <br>
      However turning in the rubble causes the 5th drummer to disappear and set the queen's quest back to the 4th drummer after a 30 min respawn time.<br>
      <br>
      Needless to say the individuals involved were upset but after scrounging a 6th bell handler (the 4th drummer twice) they proceeded.<br>
      <br>
      Handing the rubble in does not change your banned status for timera, I tried to hand in a bell and got a stonebreaker title for my effort.<br>
      <br>
      The totems are still no drop/no give which does not show promise for this quest.</font>
