		Ok Maggie. I was unable to complete this quest on my first attempt! But 
	here’s what I got! Town criers say that Lieutenant Allandal on Plateau 
	Village needs volunteers, and mentions NOT Lord Marson and previously. If 
	you go to Plateau Village the small army group is now GONE!! Only Lt. 
	Allandal is present. Here is what she says:<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Allandal tells you, &quot;Peace be with you in 
	these dark times. I serve Queen Elysa Strathelar in an information gathering 
	role, but currently those of us who gather information for Her Majesty are 
	baffled by a strange occurance.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Allandal tells you, &quot;We recently sent an army to the Fort Tethana 
	region, a move that was matched by the Viamontian loyalists. We have heard 
	nothing about either force since a report that they had sat down to parlay, 
	except for a rumor of Tumerok activity in the area.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Allandal tells you, &quot;The Queen would like you to explore the 
	area, and return with any information you find.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Allandal tells you, &quot;I have heard that others are in search of 
	information about what happened to the forces. Although Her Majesty would 
	prefer that people aid her, in this matter she believes that something which 
	transcends this war has occurred. As such, if you choose to aid the 
	Viamontians, there will be no negative ramifications from our side.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Allandal tells you, &quot;Also, if you have ventured to the 
	fortifications between here and Fort Tethana, I will accept any Viamontian 
	banners you may have retrieved.&quot;<br>
	</font><br>
	So I ran out to Fort Teth. I found a new NPC in Teth’s bar as well! 
	Lieutenant Durgan! He says he is an independent party in this. He does not 
	side with Queen Elysa or King Varicci.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Durgan tells you, &quot;Greetings, friend. 
	Though we do not claim independence...yet...we still must look after our own 
	concerns, since Elysa Strathelar won't. At times, we look to outsiders for 
	aid. Are you willing to be that aid we seek?&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">The lieutenant shrugs his shoulders.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Durgan tells you, &quot;I am Commander Margyle's 
	intelligence chief, and I have a very vexing problem. It seems that Elysa 
	sent her army in our direction, no doubt to put us directly under her heel

	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Durgan tells you, &quot;No matter who won, we

	Lieutenant Durgan tells you, &quot;There was also word of a Renegade Tumerok band

	armies, and I will reward you to tell me. If you are truly helpful, I may

	</font><br>
	Durgan said that Viamontian and Queen Elysa’s soldiers were going to parley 
	on the North coast north of Fort Teth. So I ran north. Near the coast I 
	found a large black area with LOTS of shadow. It’s basically a crater with a 
	plateau in the middle of it. In the crater I found new Shadow types. It 
	appears that Strathelar’s soldiers, and Viamontian soldiers have been turned 
	into Shadow! They are still weak to Fire! If you look around you’ll also 
	find penants laying on the ground and dead bodies. Looks like Shadow 
	destroyed everyone on both sides, plus the Tumerok forces that tried to 
	ambush them. There are L125-135 Shadow Wraiths in the crater. LOTS of them 
	so take friends with you, as they cast War and Life Drains, as well as melee 
	damage.<br>
	<br>
	On top of the plateau I found a portal called “The Dark Spiral” (16.1N 
	68.9W). It is restricted to L126+, is NOT recallable or tie-able. Once you 
	get inside the drop point IS SAFE for rebuffing as my group had to. Our 
	group was 3 mages, L156, L167, L174. They didn’t name this place a spiral 
	for nothing. The dungeon seems to be a maze almost. If you go straight down 
	the spiral you encounter L161 Twisted Shadow. Normal versions, Viamontian, 
	and Strathelar versions. All weak to fire. I also later ran into Barbaric 
	Mukkir which are L180. They were also weak to fire. Note: They do melee and 
	War, and seem prone to cold attacks. After taking a L7 Cold debuff I was hit 
	for 157 by a Mukkir.<br>
	<br>
	We found our way to a 3 way split. We decided to go straight. Later we found 
	a 2 way split. We went right. It just kept going down until we eventually 
	found ourselves going up again. I thought we were lost. We came to more 
	splits again, and I think we kept going left. Eventually we found ourselves 
	going down again until we found a pit. Lots of orange dots below us. I found 
	2-3 The Black Breaths, L648. Several L161 Shadow, and at least 2 of the 
	Barbaric Mukkir (which resist a lot). When I hit my [ ] keys I was able to 
	target something called the “Lore of the Black Spiral” down below us 
	somewhere. We tried to shoot everything in the pit before we jumped but 
	found it very difficult because everything kept moving. When we thinned it 
	out we finally jump. But shortly there after things began to spawn again! I 
	also noted throughout our journey 2 other people had died in the dungeon 
	ahead of us…. Eeek.<br>
	<br>
	One of my fellows got cornered and was killed. At this point realizing 
	things were spawning again I ran circles around the small square pit. I 
	could NOT see any exits. Perhaps because it was all dark and black, and 
	there was smoke/fog in the room. Or perhaps I was scared. I did note however 
	that before we jumped into the pit, monsters could run beneath us as if 
	maybe there is actually a false wall. I couldn’t find it before a Mukkir 
	killed me, and then instantly killed the 3rd party member as well. A L200 
	melee allegiance member of mine was also solo’ing the dungeon as we died. 
	She died about 5 minutes after we did. THIS IS DEFINITELY A GROUP QUEST 
	DUNGEON.<br>
	<br>
	That’s all I have for right now. I’ve attached a few screenshots for you. 
	I’m not sure who to talk to if you wish to side with Viamontian on this 
	quest yet…<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Ok Maggie. Couple more 
	bits of detail for you. Hehe, I took 2 fellows of people with me into the 
	dungeon this time. We faired well but 1 person died because he was impatient 
	and ran off away from the group.<br>
	<br>
	Attached are Pictures of TWO of the possible rewards.<br>
	<br>
	The Lore of the Dark Spiral (it’s a book) spawns on the floor against the 
	WEST wall in the pit at the bottom of the dungeon. No idea how we got there, 
	took over an hour. All I can say is, once you get REAL directions, people 
	had better follow them or they WILL run in circles!!<br>
	<br>
	If you turn in the book to Lieutenant Allandal you get the Shield of the 
	Strathelar Elite! AL 300, buffable, and has Moderate Impregnability on it. 
	Wield req of 126+… plus 28.4mil xp<br>
	<br>
	If you turn the book into Lt. Durgan in Fort Teth, you get… tada! Heh… 
	‘Tethana Manifesto’ You can turn it back in for more xp but I didn’t do 
	that. You get 28.4mil xp for handing in the book. The Manifesto, if hooked 
	to your house will cast “Will of the People” on you which is a Stackable 
	Self buff. HOWEVER, it WILL NOT stack with Major Willpower. Yeah, so for 
	most upper level folks it’s probably a waste. ;-)<br>

	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Durgan tells you, &quot;There is a hint of

	Was a fool, I suppose. Still, normally he would aggrandize himself, not 
	reveal his true cowardly nature in his writings. Unfortunately, his 
	ramblings do nothing to help us assess the true nature of this foe - simply 
	inspire a certain level of skepticism and make me wonder if this is a ploy 
	by Elysa or the Viamontians. Nothing could be so great as he describes.&quot;</font><br>

	Hi Maggie, wonderful site. Just finished dark spiral quest. Some additional 
	notes provided. Talk to NPC in tavern in teth to start. Tells you to go 
	north to an area near 14.8 N, 68.8W. Looks like caulcano with a mountain in 
	the middle of it. Lots of Shadows... remnants of the armies defeated there. 
	There is a journal (already mentioned) near a standard on the ground 
	opposite to the entrance on the far side of the entrance. No need to run 
	through to get it. Follow ridge around to the right. It can be turned in in 
	teth for xp later. It does not flag you for dungeon. Portal to dungeon on 
	the mountain in the middle of what is called &quot;shadow march&quot;... make your way 
	to the top to the portal. I dont remember the way down it was confusing but 
	some ways lead you in circles. I know that at one point you have a 3 way 
	split. take middle one... next split take left. Don't quote me on that. 
	Eventually you get to a jump that has about 30ish creatures... twisted 
	shadows, barbaric mukkir, 4 or so black breaths... have mages and archers 
	clear what they can first otherwise suicide!... Once mostly clear jump 
	down... clear it. There is a book on about a 30 second spawn on the ground. 
	Pick it up. Back to teth... then you get a hookable note &quot;Tethana Manifesto&quot; 
	that casts Moderate Willpower... it does not stack with cantrips and is 
	surpassed by Major Willpower. I was joined by Spiritoak, Depracitos, Vierna 
	Millithor, Maximum death, Valirea, and Captain Schmidt. Both items you get 
	can be turned in for experience. It is a percentage of your level because we 
	all got different xp (I am 199 and got about 27.5 mill for second book, not 
	sure how much for first) Hope this helps.</font></span><p>
	<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	In case this hasn't been submitted yet, the 3rd reward for completing the 
	Dark Spiral quest is available from Lieutenant Dialossa; located upstairs in 
	the NE area of the Palace of Sanamar.<br>
	<br>
	Prior to completing the quest he gives the following response.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;Let me be honest. Your 
	allegiance, whether for or against His Majesty, doesn't matter for the 
	particular matter I am dealing with. Frankly, it seems like a threat against 
	all Isparians.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;The two warring sides were on the brink of 
	battle, at long last, near the northern coast of the Direlands. But Count 
	D'Orza has not sent a report back to King Varicci. Neither have the 
	Bloodless sent a report back to their leader. There was a detachment of 
	Tumeroks in the area as well, and they also have not been heard from since.&quot;
	<br>
	Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;Something awful has happened, I fear. Please 
	gather what information you can and return, and I will do what I can to help 
	you.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	When turning in the books he replies as below<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Lieutenant Dialossa Lord Marsan's Log Book.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;The log of the 
	Bloodless who led the enemy forces? And it seems that a great force swooped 
	in and destroyed them all.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;I am skeptical of this report, and yet there 
	is no other obvious explanation. I shall accept it as written, then.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You've earned 6,674,042 experience.<br>
	<br>
	You give Lieutenant Dialossa Lore of the Dark Spiral.<br>
	The Viamontian spy wipes his forehead nervously.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;I've heard stories of 
	the Hopeslayer. Will the world be shattered under the weight of a power? I 
	must warn the king.&quot;<br>
	Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;Here is your reward. Fly it proudly.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You've earned 28,477,192 experience.<br>
	Lieutenant Dialossa gives you Viamontian Pennant of Loyalty.<br>
	</font><br>
	Viamontian Pennant of Loyalty cast Honor of the Bull on you<br>
	<br>
	The Viamontian Pennant of Loyalty is a housing item, Honor of the Bull being 
	a 30 min mod loyalty buff<br>
	<br>
	After completing the quest for any of the factions when a char speaks to 
	Lieutenant Dialossa he gives the following response<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Lieutenant Dialossa tells you, &quot;Your deed precede you. 
	I've heard you are one of the few to dare tread in the Shadow March. If you 
	have found information there, I'll gladly see it. Do not feel like you are 
	betraying any trusts...based on what I've seen, this threat affects all of 
	us.&quot;<br>
