    <span lang="en-us">Hello Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	TCers mentioned the 3 factions looking for a stolen item. Talked to the 
	Yaraq guy, since I'll stick with Elysa for now.<br>
	<br>
	I like it when NPCs give coords, so I tried the Bellenesse Sword Quest.After 
	running on the Viamontian Islands and bumping into the sea all the time (and 
	I still cant swim), I figured out from the ingame map it might be near Beach 
	Fort.<br>
	<br>
	Took Lady Miala's Estate (sp) portal from Mayoi and ran to coords 71.1N 
	50.2W like the guy said. No portal, but a dungeon anyway, just like the 
	Vulcano one on Tusk Island. So no level restrict I guess ;).<br>
	<br>
	Inside Bane, and deeper down Ripper Grievers. Place is quite a maze, and 
	only way to know I wasn't going in circles was making a trail of dead 
	spiders ;).<br>
	I sorta kept going E, and down. When there were 3 ways, I tried the middle 
	one, backtracked when I found a dead end. Found a big room with a ramp, 
	where Rippers lived, from there I took the exit on the downside, and with 
	another ramp down, there was a small room with a ramp in the middle.At 
	first, I went right hand rule from there, bumped into a lava pit, 
	backtracked, and found the &quot;Escaped Thief&quot; that screamed for help from his 
	eaters. Level 125 btw. On his corpse was the missing Sword of Bellenesse.
	</span></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span lang="en-us">Timer is 27 days for another pickup.</span></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <span lang="en-us">I returned to Yaraq, and handed the sword to the new NPC. 
	Got 3,5 million xps, and the Replica of the Sword of Bellenesse. Special 
	properties included Viamontian Knight Slayer. Wonder what the Sanamar NPC 
	would give instead... Sword was 370 weild.<br>
	When I returned the sword to him in hope for another weapon, I got another 
	2,5 million xps instead.. and no Viamontian Slayer bow or so :(.<br>
	<br>
	See attached pics for stats of Thief, Sword, and the NPC in Yaraq.<br>
	<br>
	Love the Site, hope to see the rewards from the other factions there!<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, and it's all lefts 
	from down the ramp in the center of the room. The rest I still ran around 
	randomly till I found the big room with the ramp. Down exit, keep left, take 
	middle path till the room with ramp in the middle, next all lefts till you 
	get to the thief.<br>
	<br>
	Hope this helps, <br>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hiya maggie <br>
	<br>
	Now I started in sanamr saw a new guy by the TC but Im not big on helping 
	the the king so I went to my home town and there is a new guy by the 
	armorsmith he say this <br>
	<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;Salutations, friend.&quot;<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;I wonder if you could aid me in a piece of 
	research, for which you will be well rewarded. Recently, a sword was stolen 
	from the Vaults of Sanamar, the Sword of Bellenesse. It is reported to be 
	one of the most exquisite pieces of Viamontian Weaponsmithing of its time.&quot;<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;Rumor has it that the thief is hiding in a 
	cave around 71.1 N, 50.2 W. If you could get this weapon so that I could 
	study it, I will reward you well for your time.&quot;<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;Have a care, however. If you choose to aid 
	me in this, you will have to find the blade before the agents of Sanamar or 
	Silyun do so. I do not wish to get in the middle of their feud, and would 
	not wish for you to be needlessly caught in it either. All I wish is a 
	chance to learn from the blade.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Now I ran from Ft teth cuase decl is not up I couldnt find a quick path <br>
	<br>
	Easy dungeon all lefts and you get to the escaped thief he is 135 I think he 
	has 4 abhorret(sp) eaters with him <br>
	<br>
	and there are ripper and bane grievers all the way through this <br>
	<br>
	there is no portal just a cave so dont die you get the sword of bellenesse 
	attuned and bonded <br>
	<br>
	I handed it in and I got this:<br>
	<br>
	You give Bhravarn ibn Salizim The Sword of Bellenesse.<br>
	Bhravarn examines the blade intently, handling it with the most loving care 
	and grace. <br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;Ahh, truly the work of a Master. I've not 
	seen its like ever come from Viamontian hands. Please, accept this gift with 
	my blessing. It is a blade I created based on the stories and paintings I 
	have seen of this blade. It is a humble replica, but is not warded against a 
	non Bellenesse wielding it, as the true blade is.&quot;<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim gives you Replica Sword of Bellenesse.<br>
	You've earned 3,500,000 experience.<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;If you do not wish this blade, return it to 
	me, and I will reward you in another manner.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Im going to turn it in cuase im not a sword guy brb k back <br>
	<br>
	You give Bhravarn ibn Salizim Replica Sword of Bellenesse.<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;You wish not this gift? Very well, I have 
	other ways to reward you.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 2,500,000 experience.<br>
	Bhravarn ibn Salizim tells you, &quot;I do hope that this gift is more to your 
	liking.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	K that is about it the sword is kewl and it is a 27 day timer <br>
	<br>
	Why its 27 day to pick up the sword I dont know but there you go <br>

	quest so i thought i would try from silyun. <br>
	I talked to Lucari di Bellenesse, he sent me to the same cave the others 
	send you to. When I returned the sword to him instead of recieving a replica

	<br>
	You give Lucari di Bellenesse The Sword of Bellenesse.<br>
	Lucari carefully examines the blade you have given him. With a very sad 
	expression, he sets the weapon gently aside and looks to you.<br>
	<br>
	Lucari di Bellenesse tells you, &quot;Thank you... This is indeed the sword that 
	was lost to us. All in Silyun thank you for returning this to us. It is a 
	noble thing you have done.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Lucari di Bellenesse tells you, &quot;Please, accept this token as a gift from
