	Updated during From the Darkness Born event. </font></span>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">First you go to the Esper 
	Crater, and get the bellows, same way as before. Then you go to aerlinthe, 
	and get the sluice gate bar in foundry, again, same as before. From here the 
	quest twists slightly, and you choose your path. If you want to do the OLD 
	version of the quest, YOU MUST GET THE SACRIFICIAL DAGGER. Only one is 
	needed per party. If you want to do the new version of the quest, you do not 
	need this. From here it merges again. Turn in the gate bar to the repair 
	golem to activate foundry, turn in the bellows in foundry to the smith golem 
	to activate tenkarrdun crater. Here it is still the same but slightly 
	different. The new Hellfire spawn is a couple firestorms, some of the mist/nubilous 
	golems, some magmas, and one creature labeled &quot;Tenkarrdun Hellfire.&quot; Kill 
	it, and it will drop now NINE hellfire infusions (worth 4 mil exp at GW). 
	The Behemoth of Tenkarrdun is now level 105 (previously 697), and is 
	slightly easier than a Magma Golem Exarch. Kill him and he drops a Pyreal 
	Nugged (2 of 2 dropped for me) and a black boulder. From here, go to relic 
	town. The Watchman is now labeled as &quot;Relic Watchman&quot; so he is easy to find. 
	He is harder than normal relics as he has more hp, so kill him and the keep 
	portal spawns as normal. The ring is upgraded, all item details listed 
	below. Smith Ejan is still a newbie worthless monster.<br>
	<br>
	In the Keep:<br>
	<br>
	The Keep is accessed by the same means, first/second lever, locked doors, 
	dispel traps, etc, all is the same, except there are pretty much twice as 
	many spawns everywhere. There is a difference and HERE is where you split 
	the quest. If you want to do the NEW harder version of the quest, simply do 
	the normal way to get to the lady. The hard level lady is VoD-like, complete 
	with level 7 dispels (as in she dispels debuffs to her), counter-buffs at 
	level 7, level 8 life vulns, level 7 war spells, and has dark guardians and 
	lich oppressors guarding her. DO NOT DEBUFF HER. She will counter and dispel 
	anything you do, just use a rending weapon/wand and kill her normally. She 
	also has new upgraded graphics, has full skin (isnt rotting), and has red 
	hair. You may need a group to accomplish this, as she is VoD-like with 
	health too. She drops an Ornate Key which in the chest room there is a new 
	chest on the left side, and if you open it you will receive the Aerfalle's 
	Supreme Pallium, Superior Ashbane, and War Staff of <br>
	THERE IS NO SCROLL THE HARD WAY.<br>
	<br>
	Getting the Scroll:<br>
	<br>
	In order to get the scroll, as mentioned above, you NEED the Sacrificial 
	Dagger when you enter the keep. Now here is where the original quest gets 
	changed. The normal spawn of the lady involves the VoD version of her. The 
	way to get her to be the OLD spawn is as follows. You need to go up to the 
	first lever room and pull the one on the left, then cross to the east on the 
	bottom floor. This will go up into a mirror of the lever area, only there is 
	an NPC there named &quot;Ghost of Galaeral.&quot; You need to talk to him (or not, 
	either way), then give him the Sacrificial Dagger. You will get text as <br>
	follows:<br>
	<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;The songs of my sisters echo across eternity 
	and I am left to rot; bound through the arts of ill-wind taught by sisters 
	who had fallen to the call of the twisted dark. Thousands of years bound 
	against my will to a tether not of my making, bereft of power and ability to 
	purchase a final release, I have waited and watched within the walls of this 
	prison.&quot;<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;The skein of her life now draws taut as she is 
	stirred to action, re-exerting her command over these halls and drawing on 
	the lives of those she once imprisoned. Through the countless years, most 
	that were bound here against their will have become lost and slipped into 
	madness, the echo of their lives now scattered dust and formless agony. Not 
	I.&quot;<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;I recall the device, the tool used to pull the 
	blood of my heart into a vessel that held my precious vitae long enough to 
	rip free my soul and lock it within the walls of this keep, evermore a 
	servant to her will. But my years of servitude draw near an end, and through 
	the voices of elder sisters who sang to the deep and refused to sell our 
	secrets to the Dericost I am given a moment of clarity to find my freedom. 
	Yet the walls ever remain my prison.&quot;<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;Aerfalle has changed. She has grown her flesh 
	anew and taken the glamour of her youth. But all this imagery is false. She 
	risks more power at the cost of those bound in these halls. My fallen 
	sisters seek not redemption, but through their folly they will give me mine. 
	Aerfalle's strength lies in tunnels long crushed by the weight of time, 
	halls within this keep that you cannot traverse, halls which I can still 
	travel.&quot;<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;But I cannot lessen her strength without an 
	instrument of sacrifice. The blade that drew my heart's blood must be used 
	to stab at her crusted heart and weaken her strength.&quot;<br>
	Ghost of Galaeral tells you, &quot;Bring me the dagger and I shall take my 
	revenge and aid you in her destruction.&quot;<br>
	You give Ghost of Galaeral Sacrificial Dagger.<br>
	A haunting voice echoes in the halls of the Keep. &quot;Light is not lost on this 
	world yet. I shall enact my part of this bargain, outlander. Seek vengeance 
	for the countless years, the suffering and the agony of those she has 
	destroyed. Blessings of Ithaenc go with you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	What this accomplishes is that the NPC will go weaken the lady, then you 
	follow the normal process of completing the quest. The lady is weakened to 
	her old form, so she is easy to solo/kill. She drops the old Ashen Key, and 
	you go back to the chest room and use the old chest. It contains the old 
	pallium (upgraded), the old ashbane (upgraded), the staff of aerfalle 
	(upgraded), and of course the recall scroll!</font></span></p>

      <br>
      In addition to the Repair Golem, the Aerlinthe Reservoir Dungeon also houses another horrific secret. On the second floor of the Olthoi section you'll find a room branching off from one of the Olthoi tunnels containing an altar with restraints hanging off the sides, covered in blood. A Sacrificial Dagger lies nearby.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
 This room is the scene of murder of the missionary Lady Galaeral of Ithaenc, whose mutilated body was found off the north shore, as described in the
      <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Aerlinthe.htm"> Aerlinthe Record</a>. A small group of Undead had committed the atrocity long ago. "Shrieks of pain and incomprehensible, mumbling chants" still echo within the walls.&nbsp;
