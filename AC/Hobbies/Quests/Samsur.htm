      <i><b>Dry Well Directions</b></i><br>
      <i>Have you heard about the old Empyrean well to the southeast of Samsur? Once it was fed by an underground river, and used as a caravan stop by the Empyrean. Some time ago there was a great disturbance, and the river changed its course, leaving the well dry. Musansayn the Great tried to dig new wells deep within the old caverns, but little water was found. Some say the deepest caves are haunted by spirits of the Empyrean - strange lights have been seen there.</i></font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Map: </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2">
      <a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.com/map.php?id=015A">Dry Well</a><br>
      <br>
      You'll find the Dry Well (Restricted to Levels 1-<span lang="en-us">20</span>) S<span lang="en-us">E</span> of town, past the Obsidian Enchanter, at 5.0S, 20.9E. When you enter, you'll need to head downwards until you 
      <span lang="en-us">reach a level where you see </span>three choices 
      <span lang="en-us">of routes </span>for you to take: North, East or South. If you'd like a detour, choose the South corridor which leads to a walkway overlooking a<span lang="en-us"> 
      level below</span>. You can find an Outcast 
      <a href="../../Pets/monouga.htm">Monouga</a> and a pair of 
      <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudge</a> Slinkers here. To find the Flask of Well Water, take the North passage which will lead you 
      <span lang="en-us">down another level</span>.<br>
      <br>
      When you reach a large open chamber with torches and arches, look down the length of the room<span lang="en-us"> 
      and y</span>ou'll see a set of gated doors. Fight your way past the drudges lurking about and use your key to open the door.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The well water spawns on the floor of the room, next to the well and the chest, and is guarded by several Drudge Skulkers<span lang="en-us"> 
      (24 hour timer)</span>. Be careful that you pick up the right bottle. One contains 
      <span lang="en-us">plain</span> water. The other is the Flask of Well Water that you seek.<br>
      <br>
      But what of the rumors of the well being haunted? If you use the lever on the wall of the main chamber, it opens a door in the level below. Jump off the ledge, and follow the passageway to find the source of the rumors of the Empyrean Ghost: an Ethereal 
      <a href="../../Pets/wisp.htm">Wisp</a> which guards some decent newbie loot. The exit portal is close by. The East passage up top also leads down to the lower level, but you'll still need the pull the lever in the room above to open the door.

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>NW
      Outpost - The Hundred Trackless Paths</b><br>
      The Northwest Samsur Outpost (0.1 N, 16.3 E) quest gives you a chance to learn a little about the great Gharu'ndim leader, Musansayn. When you speak to Rubid al-Jurma, he'll 
      <span lang="en-us">give you a key and </span>direct you to the famed library of this Gharu'ndim noble<span lang="en-us">. 
      You'll be asked to</span> recover a
      book <span lang="en-us">from within. </span>Return <span lang="en-us">the 
      book</span> to Rubid for a reward. Rubid al-Jurma is also Samsur's Society Agent for the 
      <a href="Exploration.htm">Exploration Society's Letter Quests</a>.</font><p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Rubid al-Jurma tells you, 
    &quot;Also, have you a moment to help me recover another item? Some years ago, 
    when the Gharu'n were just arriving here, the young noble Musansayn the 
    Great became the first leader of our people in Dereth, and founded Samsur. 
    He later disappeared into the desert.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Rubid al-Jurma gives you Library Key.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Rubid al-Jurma tells you, &quot;This key will open the door 
    to his famed library. Follow the road leading southeast - you will see his 
    house off to your left. If you can find any book remaining there, bring it 
    back to me.&quot;</font><br>
      <br>
      Head South East down the road towards town to find Musansayn's House (1.1S, 18.7E). When you see a tall stone on your right, head North East from there. You can't miss it!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      But if for some reason you do, head to Samsur proper and buy the 
    <a href="../../Culture/Rumors/Musansayn.htm">directions</a> at the Tavern.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <i>
      <b>Musansayn's House Directions</b></i><br>
      <i>The house and crypt of the Great Musansayn, the first leader of the Gharu'n in Dereth and the founder of Samsur, is now in sad repair. It is to the east-southeast of Samsur's Northwest Outpost, and may be seen from the road which runs between the two. Shortly after he died, the scribes of Zaikhal descended like Drudges upon his library, and made off with it all. Samsur was left with nothing of his
      legacy.</i></font><p>

    -- </span>home to his incredible library<span lang="en-us"> --</span> is just inside the door 
    <span lang="en-us">of</span> the courtyard. You may encounter a 
    <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudge</a> Skulker or two.<br>
      <br>
      Once inside, just follow the hanging tapestries to find your way. You'll eventually come to a set of doors with 
    <span lang="en-us">tapestries</span> on both sides of the entrance. Use
    <span lang="en-us">the Library K</span>ey on th<span lang="en-us">e</span> door to enter<span lang="en-us"> 
    the</span> Library. Inside you'll see shelves and shelves of books lining the walls. A Drudge Slinker awaits as well. Across the room, you'll see another door. Go through the door and follow corridor deeper and deeper into the library.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      You'll eventually come to a set of gated door that will take you down another level to a large open room. Candles burn in the center of the chamber.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      But that's not all that's aflame! 
    <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudges</a> are huddled around a small fire on the floor. When you get closer, you see that they are burning what remains of Musansayn's book collection!
