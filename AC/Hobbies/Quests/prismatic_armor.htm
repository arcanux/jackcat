	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;The four Essences have recently moved 
	away from the Menhir rings that once focused and held them. They are far 
	more aggressive than they once were and their continued movement has me 
	puzzled. I'm going to need more samples from the Essences to do more tests.&quot; 
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Yes, you look skilled enough to help 
	me. I require a sample from each of the four Essences.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;All of the Arcanum's attempts at 
	collecting these samples have failed. Fifteen of our best agents were 
	defeated in a recent attempt on the Essence of Verdancy. Find yourself a 
	group of adventurers at least as powerful as you before you go anywhere near 
	these new Essences.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;First, you need to retrieve four 
	Enchanted Decanters from the Arcanum Research Facility outside of Al-Jalima. 
	You will use these decanters to collect each Essence's essence. The details 
	are in these instructions.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist gives you Instructions for Essence Recovery.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Good luck and don't underestimate the 
	power of the Essences. They are raw magic after all.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	The essences have moved from where they were last month. You may now find 
	them at:<br>
	<br>
	Essence of Artifice: 38.5S, 34.3E<br>
	Essence of Enchantment: 16N, 53.3E<br>
	Essence of Strife: 11.9N, 31.9E<br>
	Essence of Verdancy: 16.7S,18.5E</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Loot 
	the crystallized shard and combine with decanter from the Arcanum Research 
	Facility (5.9N, 6.3E). Return to Ciandra in Xarabydun.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of Essence of Artifice.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of Artifice! I can't wait 
	to start testing this. These Essences react differently to various 
	alchemical tests than the pure essence we collect from the Fathomless 
	Chasm.&quot;<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of Essence of Strife.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of Strife! War in a 
	bottle eh? I don't know where to begin testing this. I'll have to confer 
	with some of the Arcanum's War Magic specialists.&quot;<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of Essence of Enchantment.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of Enchantment! You 
	didn't get any on you I hope. I theorize that this essence could have 
	dangerous effects if it comes in contact with a creature. I'll have to be 
	very careful while I'm testing this.&quot;<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of Essence of Verdancy.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of Verdancy! It's a good 
	thing this decanter is enchanted or the essence would have eaten right 
	through it and through the floor stones and through the ground beneath. In 
	fact I don't think it would stop until it reached it's source.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Let's see, where did I put those 
	enchanted gloves.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Good, more samples, let me give you 
	your reward and then I have some new matters to discuss with you.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra combines a small amount of each essence into a small vial of viscous 
	red oil. She holds the bottle up to the light and watches as the oil clears. 
	Prismatic colors can be seen spinning in vial.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Here you go. This oil works on the 
	same principle of elemental energies that the Prismatic Plume uses. Apply 
	this oil to a piece of Greater Amuli Shadow Armor and you should be able to 
	instill it with an impressive amount of elemental protection. If you would 
	prefer a different reward then give me back the Prismatic Oil and I'll see 
	what I can do.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist gives you Prismatic Oil.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ok, here's what we already know. 
	These new Essences are extremely powerful and extremely unstable. I have 
	surmised that the Cisterns have filled with elemental essence again, but 
	without the Menhir Rings focusing and stabilizing these energies they 
	have... overflowed, more like a discharge really, resulting in these new 
	Essences. With the Cisterns spilling elemental energy the Essences will keep 
	returning and gathering energy. Fascinating, but not good.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I've just completed some new tests 
	and I now believe the Essences are being drawn to the Harbinger, either 
	through some mutual bond they share or by the Harbinger's will or magic. I 
	don't need to tell you that it would be extraordinarily bad if the Essences 
	were to reach the Harbinger.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Luckily with these essence samples 
	you brought me I can complete the potion I've been working on to prevent the 
	Essences from getting any closer to Yanshi.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra combines a small amount of each essence into a decanter of glowing 
	blue liquid. She says a small incantation and holds the decanter up to the 
	light, watching as the liquid inside changes color to a dark violet hue.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;This Nullified Essence should place a 
	barrier over the spot it is poured. Take this to the big Stone in Old Yanshi 
	and pour it over the top of it. If it works the Essences should return to 
	their Menhir or at least to their vicinity. Others are helping me with this 
	task as well. Work together and be careful not to use more than thirty of 
	these potions within a few minutes time. After thirty applications the 
	potion has a lessening return. As always return with anything you think I 
	might find useful in my research.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist gives you Decanter of Nullified Essence.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I've also recently received word from 
	an Arcanum Researcher on Aerlinthe Island. He found an buried structure 
	there which may have something you can use to instill the other Greater 
	Shadow Armor sets with the Prismatic Oil. Here take his report.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist gives you An Ancient Masonry on Aerlinthe.<br>
	<br>
	Bring the Decanter of Nullified essence to Ben Ten's stone in Yanshi at 
	12.7S, 46.2E. Fight the waves of elementals until the Reflection of the 
	Harbinger spawns and drops the Reflective Shard.<br>
	<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Reflective Shard.<br>
	Ciandra takes the shard. Peering closely at it's reflective surface, she 
	looks deep in thought.<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;It troubles me that the Harbinger 
	made such easy work of the Nullification Barrier. This just proves what I 
	feared though. The Harbinger is drawing the Essences to itself.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;It was a lucky thing you were able to 
	bring this shard back to me though. With this I may be able to devise some 
	other means of preventing the Harbinger from amassing more power. Here's a 
	small token of my gratitude. You've really come through for the Arcanum.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 7,500,000 experience.<br>
	<br>
	Head to Aerlinthe for the glyph: 88.1N, 
	47.6E. Loot the key from the Ancient Steward. Use the Glyph of Alteration on&nbsp; 
	a mote and use the prismatic oil on the Pyreal Glyph to get a Prismatic 
	Glyph. Use on armor for Prismatic Armor.<br>
