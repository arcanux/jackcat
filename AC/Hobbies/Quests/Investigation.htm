<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the
<a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Waking2.htm">Waking from 
the Abyss</a> event.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Town Crier 
tells you, &quot;Royal Guards in Lytelthorpe are looking for individuals to help in 
divine secrets that lie in deep caverns that stretch to the sea. Additionally, 
there is a call out in capital cities looking for adventurers who wish to help 
find the failed assassin, who tried to kill the High Queen.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Noir quest 
allows you to help the Royal Guard investigate the attempt against High Queen 
Elysa's life. When you complete your sleuthing, you'll receive new detective 
clothing, the Gumshoe Title, and other random rewards. There are no level 
restrictions for the quest; even very low levels should be able to complete it.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin, speak 
with Guard Chandler Hammett at the entrance of the Lytelthorpe castle - 0.9N, 
51.1E.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Guard Chandler Hammett tells you, &quot;Hail friend, perhaps 
you haven't seen the signs in the capital cities. We've been asked to assist in 
an investigation. Dame Brinna O'Shea is handling the proceedings...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The guard went on. This was beginning to look 
like an interesting proposition. The capital cities, eh. Who knows maybe they'd 
provide me with a little insight. I weighed the possibilities and thought about 
visiting this Dame. But first I needed to find out where she was hiding. The 
sign in the capital cities was my only clue.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The signs can be 
found in the capital cities of Cragstone, Hebian-To and Ziakhal:<br>
--</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Hebian-To -&nbsp; 39.0S, 82.9E<br>
--Cragstone - 25.4N, 49.2E<br>
--Zaikhal - 13.5N, 0.7E</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;A sign. They're everywhere nowadays...from the 
smile on the grocer's face, to the voices that carry on the wind. I'd seen a 
fair share of signs in my day, but this was a day like no other and this was a 
sign that I couldn't pass by.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I was walking through the center of another capital city -minding my 
own business- when the sign called to me, like a cheap piece of amuli gifted 
with a major coordination cantrip. Curiosity got the better of me and like an 
ursuin cub, I found myself staring at the honeypot...this sign.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;I didn't mean to get involved, and if given 
the choice, I might keep my hands clean... turn the other way and let well 
enough alone. But who was I trying to fool? I was just as interested as the next 
person trapped on this crazy world, where magic rules and bugs can talk.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The letters were evenly spaced, like the cobwebs that lined my mind. 
The words had been written by a fair and steady hand. I could only imagine it 
was a Dame who had started me off on this path. If it was a Dame... that meant 
trouble. Dames -always- meant trouble.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;I finished reading. I caught the bits and 
pieces hidden in the well-written prose. There was something amiss. This Dame 
needed help. She was reaching out to any soul that didn't have 'dark master of 
all things evil' tattooed on their foreheads. I pondered if I should get 
involved as I read the location of her place.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The Lytelthorpe Keep, Central Tower. Would I stay, or would I go?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After reading a 
sign, return to Lytelthorpe and speak to Dame Brinna O'Shea inside the Castle 
Tower. She'll give you a Clean Towel and a Trade Note and will direct you to a 
copse of trees outside of Nanto.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, &quot;You must have seen the 
sign. Please sit down.&quot;<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, &quot;I'm so glad you came...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;They were always glad. It meant that they no 
longer had to shoulder the weight of what they knew alone. Camaraderie came from 
such knowledge. She kept talking and I was having trouble listening.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;My mind kept drifting away to other thoughts. She talked fast, like 
the buzzing of bees around the first flower in spring. I was doing my best to 
keep up with the conversation but...there was too much. After a moment or two, I 
didn't care anymore. I got comfortable...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The Dame kept going, talking about some man. Maybe in green armor, 
with a green dagger or something like that; I didn't care anymore. Her voice was 
grating on my nerves, like cheese drawn over a cheese grater. I shifted and got 
really comfortable.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The Dame was worried. I felt like I should stand up, clear my 
throat, tell her everything would be fine. But that would mean she'd sob.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Too late. The buzzing sound of her voice gave way to delirious talk 
about assassination. I pretended to listen and leaned forward...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Then it ceased. It was like opening a Singularity Chest to find 
three perfectly matched dual major armor pieces, each enhancing a skill I 
possessed. But like every dream, it ended. Reality smacked me in the jaw, like a 
Peerless Drudge catching me with my faceplate up. The droning pitch of her voice 
returned. I got comfortable and listened to the rest of the Dame's tale.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, &quot;...and that's why I need 
you to help me.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;I stood quickly. Better she thought I had 
heard everything that she had to say, rather than tell her the truth. I crossed 
my arms and gave her a stern look.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Before I could think, I said 'I'll do it.'&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">You say, &quot;I'll do it.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;She gave me a clean towel...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Clean Towel.</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;...a trade note for my trouble...&quot;<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Trade Note (100).<br>
You think, &quot;...and a location...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, &quot;The last spot we knew he 
could be found was off the road in a copse of trees, north of Nanto.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;I didn't have to ask what to expect there. 
Like I said before, Dames were always trouble. I was knee deep with this one.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Brinna O'Shea tells you, &quot;Thank you, again.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The kiss was a nice touch. Though it left me 
with a sinking feeling. Like getting caught off your guard when the Hopeslayer 
asks you a question. Never peeve the 24 foot tall Lord of Darkness, you might 
find yourself falling from the top of the world and believe me, you can't see 
your house from there.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I weighed my choices and decided what I needed to do. The entrance 
to the place would be hidden amongst the trees, but I'd find a way in.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The trees are 
located around 47.2S, 83.2E. You need to locate the one that will portal you to 
MacNiall's Freehold on the Vesayan Isles. If you use (double-click) the wrong 
tree, you'll get the following message:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;I was rattled. I found myself unable to find the forest for the 
trees. I ran my hands along the bark, searching for any type of clue that might 
help me understand what the Dame wanted. I should have been listening. Now I was 
out here playing patty-cake with a tree...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;...I felt pretty foolish.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The portal tree 
is located at 47.3S, 83.4E and has a small shrub growing next to it. You'll know 
you've found it when you stop feeling foolish! </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;Ever since I left the Dame standing in her room all alone I couldn't 
help but wonder...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;What was the towel for? I stopped and looked myself over twice, 
nothing on my face or hands. I knew I should have been paying attention while 
she was talking, but her voice kept me occupied.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I found myself running my hands over trees. They all looked alike in 
this little copse. I felt strange, like being watched. The feeling passed after 
a moment... As I ran my hands over the tree in front of me, I was struck by an 
odd feeling of deja vu...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I didn't remember seeing this place before, but somewhere in the 
dark shadows that shrouded my mind, I knew I had. Sure it had changed, but a lot 
had changed since I walked through that first swirling portal on Ispar. I was no 
hero there. I was simply living my life. I felt like I was waiting for 
something.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I had the urge to dance...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I suddenly realized that this tree was different from the others. 
There was a light syrupy texture that coated the branches. I pulled my hand up 
to my lips for a quick taste.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;A heavy weight landed on my shoulders in the form of my head. It was 
like having 'Weight of the World' cast on you while making a run to the shop to 
unload your latest armor haul. Everything slowed down and a taste of honey 
filled my mouth. I dropped to a knee...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;...but it wasn't enough. I fell to the ground, like a mosswart who 
had zigged when he should have zagged.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#99CCFF">Tree teleports you with Knocked Out.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>
You think, &quot;The world spun out of control, a long gray tunnel filled with purple 
shards told me that I was heading back to my lifestone. The tree's sap had 
played the role of hammer to my olthoi shell.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;But my ride through the big swirl dropped me somewhere else. I 
didn't know where I was. An open book on a nearby desk called to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">After being portaled, you'll find yourself in 
a house in MacNiall's Freehold at 74.4S, 92.1E. Read the Open Journal on the 
table by the window.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The book told a strange tale. Seems that there was an operation 
waylaying adventurer's foolish enough to come into contact with that tree. Some 
kind of strange powder created by a man that lurked in the shadows coated the 
branches. The powder induced hallucination and caused paralysis. That explained 
the dancing... and the falling down.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Reading on, I found out that whoever was keeping this little ledger 
was responsible for delivery of those that fell at the tree. Seems like I was 
supposed to be next.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I had been kidnapped. Whoever had written this journal had thought 
better of delivering me to the brigands. They'd left me with my armor, weapons 
and trinkets...I'd need to find them and shake them down for information. 
Judging by the timbre of the book, that wouldn't be hard.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Outside, I heard the sounds of the jungle. I wasn't on the mainland 
of Dereth. No, more likely this was the Vesayen Islands. Somewhere outside, I 
figured on finding answers.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Exit the house 
and speak to Gentleman Jake Hawkins the Lunatic, located at 74.5S, 92.3E. He'll 
hand you a signed Confession, a torch, and a portal gem to the Bandit Hideout!</font></span></p>
<p align="left">
  <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Rumor:
  <a href="../../Culture/Rumors/Confession.htm">
  Confession</a></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The man standing before me looked haggard. As soon as he saw me 
approaching, he started shaking like a leaf getting ready to be shed in the 
autumn air.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Being one to press my advantage, I shook the man down.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;He folded like a simulacrum skin suit falling to the ground...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;He was begging me not to slap him silly. He wasn't worth the effort. 
His tale was pretty simple. Lonely kid, came through the portal from Ispar and 
got involved in the wrong crowd. He'd heard whispers coming down through the 
chain of command and ran when the kitchen fires grew too hot. Now he was a 
refugee, living in MacNiall's Freehold. He talked big, but sobbed bigger.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I was less than enthused, and waited for his blubbering to end.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;When his tantrum was done he handed me a torch...&quot;<br>
Gentleman Jake Hawkins gives you Torch.<br>
You think, &quot;...a signed confession...&quot;<br>
Gentleman Jake Hawkins gives you Confession.<br>
You think, &quot;...and a portal gem.&quot;<br>
Gentleman Jake Hawkins gives you Portal Gem.<br>
You think, &quot;The choice was up to me now. Did I chance what lay in the dungeon 
beyond this gem. The blubbering idiot standing before me told me it was dark. 
How dark? Dark enough that the torch would be my only light. I wasn't afraid, 
just wary...maybe this would best wait for a later time.&quot;</font></span></p>

        <hr=60%>
<span lang="en-us"><font color="#66FF99" face="Arial" size="2">You think, &quot;Gentleman Jake proved to be good to his word. This place was dark, 
nearly as dark as the shadowy souls that stalked the darker places of Dereth. 
I'd need to watch my step in here or get stuck at the bottom of some ditch. What 
the gentleman hadn't told me about was that the portal gem he'd given me dropped 
me in a room with no doors. Just this bookcase.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;No surprise that when I started to peruse the shelves I found that 
most of them were covered in settled dust. All the books were covered in the 
dust too, except one. It stood out like a Virindi at an allegiance meeting. I 
pulled the book a little and the bookcase parted.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Head down to the 
lower level of the hideout. From the entrance, go left at the split, then left 
and left again. Next intersection make a right, then a left and another left. 
Head down the spiral staircase, then make a left to the room with the Graven 
Idol. When you use it, you'll be portaled again!</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>
<br>
</font></span><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The stone was smooth along the bottom and looked roughly like a 
mosswart. In the dark, it was difficult to tell if there were markings lining 
the base of the statue. For the first time since talking to the Dame I felt 
lost, confused. What did the mosswarts have to do with an assassination attempt? 
Did they have anything to do with it?&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The dark room had me jumping at shadows, a shiver ran down my 
spine.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;That feeling of being watched came over me again. Without warning 
the great behemoth in front of me came to life...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I threw my hands up instinctively...&quot;<br>
</font></span>
        <hr=60%>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You think, 
&quot;...voices started hammering my ears, like lugians pounding metal on anvils in 
Linvak Tukal. The statue swung once...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;My world spun out of control.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#99CCFF">Graven Idol teleports you with Beaten into Submission.</font></font></span><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>
You think, &quot;I saw the spinning of the portal and realized what was coming next.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The trip was rough, I felt like a banderling had just hit me upside 
the head with a club while I was wearing a cloth cap. Not enough foresight on 
the hunters part. Only this time, the hunter was looking to trap answers and 
catching beatings in their place.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I figured on seeing my lifestone again. But as the swirl of portal 
space started to drip away, leaving the hard edges of reality in its place, I 
saw that things couldn't be much worse than this. I was caged like a sacrifice. 
On the floor, lay a broken fishing pole and a skeleton. A set of keys taunted me 
out in the hall beyond a locked prison door. The slack jaw and vacant eyes of 
the skeleton mocked me, like a tattoo displayed on one of the drones standing 
around the marketplace. Dead men told no tales for the most part, but something 
told me that this skeleton would be howling like a mite, if given half a 
chance.&quot;</font></span></p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh no! You're trapped in a cage with the 
remains of a skeleton. You can see a Key Ring on the opposite wall. Luckily, a 
broken fishing rod lies on the ground. Wield it in your weapon slot, then use 
your [ &amp; ] keys to locate the keyring, then press the &quot;r&quot; key to retrieve it. 
You should now have the Gate Key and can escape from your cell!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;Though I struggled to reach the ring through the bars of the prison 
gate, it remained just outside of my reach. Who was I kidding, even with a -budiaq- 
the distance would be a stretch. If only I had a longer pole.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Brilliance comes in small bursts. Sometimes when starving becomes a 
possible reality- Possible reality...wasn't that an oxymoron? No time to quibble 
with myself. I gently lifted the key and drew it toward me, score one for being 
brighter than the poor soul beside me.&quot;<br>
Key Ring gives you Gate Key.<br>
You think, &quot;I couldn't contain my elation.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I felt like Alatar Locke documenting his latest find. This key was 
my ticket to freedom, and I was ready to be set free. I decided that the pole 
might have some worth if I gave it back to the Dame, when the time came.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The room beyond was full of torches, cells like mine, and a single 
wooden door. I figured the door wasn't going to open by the usual method, and 
the key ring was empty. I felt like a rat caught in maze without cheese. My 
stomach was grumbling, and I could smell food cooking somewhere beyond.&quot;</font></span></p>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">You think, &quot;As I grabbed the torch and tried to twist I was met with resistance. 
The kind of resistance you'd expect from a Virindi after saying it was an 
individual. Nothing was moving, the door remained closed.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;In the rooms beyond, I heard the sound of people snoring. They were 
all asleep, like mu-miyah wrapped snugly in their sarcophagi. If I was smart and 
quiet, I might find my way out. No need to itch for a fight. I noticed a 
discarded piece of cloth lying on the ground not far from the torch. Maybe it 
would come in handy.&quot;</font></span></font></p>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Past the door are 
rooms full of sleeping Bandits. If you pass through without waking them, you'll 
be safe. Attack them, and there will be trouble! Eventually, you'll reach Klaus

<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;This guy was something else. They must have 
been paying him the pocket change that young banderlings carry around. He kept 
going on about only needing 100 pyreals. 100 pyreals? I had a trade note for 
that much. Did the Dame know that I'd need it...I'd written it off as a 
back-handed sum of cash to undertake a dangerous case. Now, I saw the irony of 
the situation was like statues built in foundries beneath our towns.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;He was looking for a bribe. I just might have 
the money he needed.&quot;<br>
You give Klaus Trade Note (100).<br>
You think, &quot;He looked like a kid running around the holiday pole. The gleam in 
his eye reminded me of a diamond golem in the noonday sun. He opened the door 
without hesitation and bowed deeply.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Look for the 
Encrusted Scrollcase near the Altar. When you use it, you'll get the following 
text:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;The room was full of gold and trinkets, but this was the real prize. 
It was stuck to the top of a pedestal by hardened and caked mud. I tried to pry 
the thing off the pedestal to no avail. I needed something to clean it with...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The towel!&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Once again my initial discussion with the Dame flooded into my head. 
She'd given me a towel. I hadn't known what it was for. Now, it was all clear. I 
needed to handle this thing right. If I could just get the towel to wipe off the 
scroll case...&quot;<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course! The towel! Give the towel to the 
Encrusted Scrollcase to clean it, then retrieve the Odd Scroll Case to return to

You think, &quot;I wiped the scroll case clean, the towel was as rancid as a swamp 
gromnie's breath. I tossed it aside. Then, like a tinkerer applying iron to a 
client's prized sword, I lifted the scroll case.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I had the case in my hand, I didn't want to open it for fear that 
the contents might crumble away to nothing. Besides, in the recesses of my mind 
I figured this was what the Dame was looking for. I looked around the room and 
spotted a portal. It beckoned me like the soul cage that imprisons Gaerlan.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;I was happy...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;...and there was no time like the present to see where the portal 
would take me.&quot;<br>

you help us? Of course I could. The question was - would I?&quot;</font><br>

showed my pride by standing like a conquering hero.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;She handed me two gifts...&quot;<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Crimped Hat.<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Gumshoe Token.<br>
You think, &quot;...a hat and a token. She said she'd take the token and give me a 
new title. Something like, gumshoe. I didn't ken what the Dame was saying, but 
the words felt pretty good. Praise is best served warm and meaningful.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;She turned back, holding a trinket. I tried to tell her no.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;She'd hear nothing of it...&quot;<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Silver Crown.</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You think, &quot;She dropped the trinkent into my hands. A reward for a job well 
done.&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;Again, she blew me a kiss. This Dame was strange, it was just a 
note. Sure it might be a lead to solving a question about who tried to kill the 
High Queen, but then again it might lead to an interesting new recipe for 
chicken. I smiled either way, bowed...&quot;<br>
You Think, &quot;...and headed out to join the festival celebrations. I wish that 
there was something I could do with this broken fishing pole and this scroll 
case. Something gnawed at my conscience, like a reedshark gnawing a shin bone, I 
didn't think that I'd found all there was to know. For now, I was content to 
enjoy the holiday cheer.&quot;</font></font></span></p>

reel before I handed the broken pole over. I made some quick comment to her 
about finding it in the bandit hideout. Maybe it'd turn up a clue here or there. 
It was a lie. It felt like a lie, thinking quick I scratched my head...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;That threw her off, I don't believe it...it threw her off. Wait, why 
am I thinking this? Ooo, did she just say something funny...&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;...drat, a second too late and now I look foolish, Hmmm...what to 
do?&quot;<br>
You think, &quot;The Dame paused and then turned away a moment...I stopped acting 
like a jerk...&quot;<br>
Dame Brinna O'Shea gives you Gold Chainmail Breastplate.<br>
You think, &quot;Apparently she knew my ruse...still this was better than a useless 
fishing rod. She bowed...&quot;<br>
