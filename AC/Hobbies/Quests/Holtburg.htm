    Ryndmad tells you, &quot;Greetings! Welcome to Holtburg! I am the local 
    representative of the Explorer Society. My job is to help new arrivals in 
    Dereth get settled in and learn their way around.&quot;<br>
    Flinrala Ryndmad tells you, &quot;If you have just arrived in Dereth, you should 
    talk to my friend Worcer. He is looking for some help with an errand. He's a 
    good man - if you help him out, he will help you out.&quot;<br>
    Flinrala Ryndmad tells you, &quot;Or you can peruse the rumors at the bar. 
    Wilomine always knows something that needs doing.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="arial">Completing the Holtburg 
    starter quests introduces you to one of Dereth's well known historical 
    events.</font><font face="arial" size="2"> In <span lang="en-us">the year 6</span>, Holtburg was overrun by Tumeroks. The residents fled the town 
    and hid in the Holtburg Redoubt. Celcynd the Mage was able to summon a 
    portal to Rithwic to save the children, but sadly, was unable to save the 
    adults. A Historical Marker now commemorates those who died in the old 
    Redoubt and an
    <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10305.html">Eternal 
    Flame</a> burns in their memory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2">
    <a href="../../npc.asp-npcID=1098.html">Worcer</a>, a 
    former resident of the West Holtburg Outpost, was one of the orphans saved 
    in the attack and now seeks mementoes of his parents. You'll find him in the 
    tavern next to Flinrala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
    Worcer tells you, &quot;I'd appreciate your help recovering some items from the 
    old Redoubt.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;My parents were killed there when I was but a boy, when 
    Holtburg was overrun with Tumeroks. I was saved, whisked away by the mage 
    Celcynd at my parents' behest.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;The Redoubt is directly south of here. We put up an 
    eternal flame at the site, in memory of all the townsfolk who died. Some of 
    us are also trying to get together an exhibit to honor our parents. For 
    instance, my mother had these heirloom dishes she was always polishing. She 
    loved those dishes ...&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;Anyway, if you could recover any of these items for our 
    exhibit, I will reward you as well as I can.&quot;<br>
    Worcer gives you A List of Items.<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;If you need more help getting to the Redoubt, you can buy 
    directions from Wilomine at the bar.&quot;</font></font></p>

      There are eight items total you'll need to locate. Make a right through the set of doors at 
    the entrance. The Brass Candlestick is the first item 
    you'll find, on the floor next to a table.</p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Go through the next set of doors and you'll be at a 4 way 
    intersection. Make a right, and at the next intersection make a left. Go 
    down the ramp and make another left at the bottom. You should see a set of 
    stairs heading down. At the bottom, go right through the 
    door. The Antique Bowl is in a room to your right.</font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Head back to the hall at the 
    bottom of the stairs and head</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
    west until you see a door on 
    your left. You'll find two items in the Bunk Rooms: the Antique Platter, and 
    a Bronze Lamp. </font> </p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Follow the passage until you 
    reach a large room 
    with some tables overlooking the level below. 
    At the north end of the room you'll see a catwalk. 
    In a room directly west of the catwalk you'll find the Bronze Handbell.
    Next go to the room to your south and retrieve the 
    Wedding Band from the Hope Chest in the corner, tucked away near the rows of beds.</font></p>
      <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Go through the door next to 
    the chest and follow the passage until you see a door to your right. The 
    Antique Mug is<span lang="en-us"> located inside</span>. Head south as you exit the room and follow the 
    corridor around several turns and stairs until you reach the 
    <span lang="en-us">large</span> room under 
    the catwalk. The final item, an Antique Goblet<span lang="en-us">,</span> is at the<span lang="en-us"> 
    far</span> end of the room.

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have all 8 items, 
    return to Worcer in Holtburg (If you used the lifestone before heading out, 
    simply type /lifestone). He'll reward you with experience for each item you 
    return<span lang="en-us">!</span></font></p>

      </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">You give Worcer Bronze Lamp.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Worcer tells you, &quot;Hardunna's father, Roland, brought 
    this with him from Ispar. He gave it to Hope, his wife, when they met. I am 
    so glad to have this for our museum. You have my sincere thanks.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">You've earned 3,000 experience.<br>
    </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Worcer tells you, &quot;You know, since you've been so 
    helpful to me, perhaps you could also help Flinrala. She doesn't talk about 
    it much, but she still grieves for her father, Brogord. He died defending 
    the Redoubt.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;One of his axes is rumored to be in the Cave of Alabree, 
    a bit west of here. Perhaps you could go and take a look? Bring anything you 
    find back to Flinrala - I'm sure she'll be happy to have it.&quot;<br>
    Worcer tells you, &quot;Here, here are the directions. Wilomine also sells them, 
    in case you lose those.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Worcer gives you Directions to the Cave of Alabree.</font></font></p>
