Give Kai Mallan your Reward Gems, and he will give you the Portal Gem to The 
Callous Heart. You are allowed three portal gems a week. It's probably best to 
get all three of your portal gems now, because if you die inside, you will 
appear at the lifestone. It's quicker to return to the dungeon if you already 
have another portal gem ready to use. </font></span></p>

have two remaining journeys within. Do not leave this place by any means, for 
you cannot return more than three times within the space of one full cycle of

<p><span lang="en-us"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">The Callous Heart Entry<br>
</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">When you use the portal gem, you will be 
transported into the
<a target="_blank" href="../../Travel/maps/CallousMain.htm">
Callous Heart Entry</a> area, an open room with Bright Silver Keys scattered on the floor. 
Pick one up for use inside the dungeon (you can pick up as many as you want). 
There are several hallways from this main room leading to a series of portals. 
The North and West passages both lead to The Callous Heart High Grounds Portal, 
restricted to Levels 45+. The East passage leads to The Callous Heart Left Wing 
- Levels 30+, and the South passage leads to the Right Wing - Levels 15+. The 
portals cannot be tied to, recalled or summoned.</font></span></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">The Callous Heart Right Wing - 15+<br>
The Callous Heart Left Wing - 30+<br>
The Callous Heart High Grounds - 45+</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>The Callous Heart Right Wing<br>
</b>The Right Wing, restricted to Levels 15+, is the easiest, but that's not 
saying it's easy! When you enter, you'll fall a short distance, taking a few 
points damage. The initial room has a Harnessed Scintilla (Level 48) and a 
Controlled Flamma (Level 48). They'll hit you with Lightning and Fire damage, as 
well as Lightning Bolt III and Flame Bolt III. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">If you manage to make it past these two foes, 
you'll <span lang="en-us">see a ramp on the opposite side of the room. Head 
down... into a room with about</span> 10 more of them! <span lang="en-us">Your 
goal is to reach the chest across the room.</span> Use your Bright Silver Key on 
the chest for your reward: An Encrusted Bloodstone Jewel (worn on the neck) with 
the spell Essence Spike (increases maximum health by 20 points). The chest 
contains numerous Jewels, but you will only be able to pick up<span lang="en-us"> 
one</span>.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>The Callous Heart Left Wing<br>
</b>The Left Wing is restricted to Levels 30+. Again, you'll take a small bit of 
damage on a fall at the entry. This dungeon is full of Obedient Obsidian Golems 
and Controlled Frosts (Level 51). The reward in the chest at the end is also An 
Encrusted Bloodstone Jewel, but the spell is Essence Sluice (increases max 
health by 25 points).</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2"><b>The Callous Heart High Grounds</b><br>
The most dangerous dungeon is the High Grounds, restricted to Levels 45+. The 
inside is full of Bound Crystal Golems (Level 200) and Bound Coral Golems (Level 
341), all on a very quick respawn. These creatures are just like their unbound 
compatriots, but do not drop loot (although they<span lang="en-us">'re</span> 
30K xp<span lang="en-us"> a pop!</span>). After a short fall on entry, you'll be 
greeted by about a dozen of them. A small walk-way leads down into another 
pillared room, but there<span lang="en-us">'s no safety there, only another 
large group of them</span>! </font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">Head up another ramp and bear NW to find the 
chest.<span lang="en-us"> Be careful not to get trapped against a wall; if you 
do, you're a goner.</span> Large groups have been known to be wiped out 
completely<span lang="en-us"> in this dungeon</span>. Prepare for massive 
Bludgeoning damage! The chest at the end contains An Encrusted Bloodstone Jewel 
with the spell Essence Glutton (increases max health by 30 points).</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">It is possible to solo these dungeons by using 
Impen, heavy Banes and Protections, and boosting your health by any means 
possible (Elysa's Favor, Endurance, Health Elixirs, etc.) then running through 
to the end (shields recommended). Consider turning down your graphics to reduce 
lag. </font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">Note: if you log out in the dungeon, you will be 
at the lifestone when you log back in.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">The Encrusted Bloodstone Jewels are no-drop, 
no-give. The spells may not be layered with Life Giver from Elysa's Favor.</font></td>
