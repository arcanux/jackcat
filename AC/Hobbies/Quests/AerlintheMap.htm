      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Island Drop-Off Point - 84.1N 47.1E</b><br>
      The island drop-off point is relatively safe. You'll often find adventurers buffing in the water to the south of the platform. There's a portal to the N. Direlands (restricted to levels 35+) with a destination  of 5.5N, 87.5W. Weretirae, a lighthouse to the north, looms nearby.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abandoned Town - 86.4N, 45.6E</b><br>
      The Abandoned Town is all that remains of the original Yalaini settlement -- a small arrangements of temples grouped around a sacrificial altar. Charred corpses contorted in various positions litter the area. One temple, a former library, contains the Charred Book that translates into the Aerlinthe Record. To find it, look for a temple with a standing stone in front. You'll also find Smith Ejan here.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Raina's Harbor</b><br>
      Named for the wife of Lord Gervan Loritaine, the original settler of the island, this harbor is extremely treacherous. You'll encounter numerous Coral Golems, Fire Wisps, Silver Tuskers and more. To reach the abandoned town and other areas on the west side of the island, you might consider going all the way around the island, rather than across the harbor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>T-Shirt Vendor - 84.3N, 45.0E</b><br>
      This island vendor sells the Aerlinthe Monarch and Patron T-Shirts ("My Monarch went to Aerlinthe and all I got was this lousy T-shirt"). You'll find him inside a small tent surrounded by spawns of Banderlings, Shreth and Drudges.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aerlinthe Reservoir - 85.5N, 43.4E</b><br>
      The Aerlinthe Reservoir dungeon is restricted to levels 45+. Inside, you'll find the Repair Golem to whom you must give the Sluice Gate Bar. The dungeon also contains the Sacrificial Dagger used in the murder of Lady Galaeral of Ithaenc. You'll find it on the 2nd floor of the Olthoi Section..&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tenkarrdun Foundry - 88.9N, 42.7E</b><br>
      The Sluice Gate Bar can be found within the Tenkarrdun Foundry (restricted to levels 24+). The dungeon is extremely dangerous. You'll encounter all sorts of high level golems -- Diamond, Vapor and Plasmas, plus other formidable creatures, such as Infernos and Fire Wisps.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aurlanaa's Gromnatross Aerie - 89.1N, 42.8E</b><br>
      From the Aerlinthe Record: RE 274: The Blessing of Aerlinthe. A gromnatross makes her aerie on the peaks of Cunara. She is named Aurlanaa by the people of the port.&nbsp;<br>
      Cunara is the peak to the west of Tenkarrdun as mentioned in entry RE 222 of the Aerlinthe Record. If you go up on top of this peak, you find an area that resembles a nest. It contains a handful of Ash Gromnies. Nowhere else on the island will you find these. When you stand in the aerie, the immediate area is blinded by lightning every few seconds and you can hear voices similar to those you hear when standing in the mana pools of Meeting Halls. This gives credence to some theories that Gromnies are immature Gromnatrosses. Read more about Aurlanna in entries RE 895, TE 17 and HE 348 of the Record.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Behemoth of Tenkarrdun - 90.2N, 46.1E</b><br>
      The powerful Behemoth of Tenkarrdun (level 596) spawns inside the Tenkarrdun Crater. After his defeat, you can claim a Black Boulder as a reward which can be turned into the Black Fire Atlan Stone.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shimena Keep - 91.4N, 41.7E</b><br>
      From the Aerlinthe Record: RE 208: Shimena Keep constructed on the northeast islet. Shimena guarded the northern approaches to Ireth Lassel research colony from Pelagian sea-nomads.&nbsp;<br>
      Shimena Keep is found on the NE of the island. It is a large fortress infested with Diamond and Plasma Golems, Relic and Cursed Bones, and Dark Revnants. The beach surrounding the fort is guarded by Vapor Golems and pressure plates that trigger bolts of lightning which shoot out of the statues lining the walls of the Keep. If you step on one of these pressure plates a second time, you may get a message about the towers recharging for another shot. Inside, you'll find the three landmarks mentioned in the Aerlinthe Record: a Skytower, used to patrol the northeast water; a larchess tree; and a Memorial Stone, inscribed with the names of those who died in the Pelagic raids of 323. You will also find a portal to the N Yanshi Advocate Tower, one of only two portals off the island.&nbsp;<br>
