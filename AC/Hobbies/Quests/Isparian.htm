    out here in the desert. It has been a difficult task building up this place 
    with all of the suspicion that has recently been cast upon the Arcanum in 
    the wake of Nuhmudira's disappearance. Rest assured however, that though her

    us. He said that he wanted to help, that he was worried about Nuhmudira and 
    he...well he gave us some very important and revolutionary guidance. Since 
    that time we have been making great strides forward in our research. So much 
    so that we think that soon - No I should not overspeak myself.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>

    we were falling behind, and no matter how great our efforts we still could 
    not decipher the secrets that were in our way. But with his assistance we 
    have overcome the greatest obstacle that stood before us in the enhancement 
    of the weapons crafted from Pyreal.&quot;<br>
    Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;We've been hard at work on the pieces 
    that he asked us to craft for him. We await word from one of his emissaries 
    to know that we can set people out on the task of collecting the final 
    pieces that he is helping us procure. But he has been silent for one full 
    cycle of the moons now. We have begun to worry.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>

    important aspects of what must be done to better enhance your weaponry. 
    Please, listen carefully. I will only impart this knowledge to you but once, 
    as is Asheron's will.&quot;<br>
    Emissary of Asheron tells you, &quot;The power of this worlds magic is strongest 
    here on Dereth it is why his people chose this place as a refuge and place 
    of learning. Lord Asheron has found a font of pure mana, the essence of all 
    magic beneath this land. He has begun excavation of a tunnel that will lead 
    you there so that you may collect this essence and find an application with 
    what your Arcanum teaches.&quot;<br>
    Emissary of Asheron tells you, &quot;You must take care however to not expose 
    yourself to the mana. You will need a device by which to contain the 
    essence, else it twist your form into something that cannot be saved. Your 
    Arcanum has been working on such a device. Return to Ciandra and ask her for 
    something to harness the essence within. Then you should be ready to embark 
    into the earth to obtain the essence.&quot;</font></p>

    composure.<br>

    Alchemist tells you, &quot;In the past few months I am sure you are aware that 
    Martine has been harrying our people with assaults that have finally spread 
    to the mainland. His latest assault was done solely against the Arcanum. 
    Somehow he divined the location of our research facilities not far outside 
    of Al-Jalima.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>
    Ciandra sighs.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum 
    Alchemist tells you, &quot;Sorry...we lost some very important research there. 
    Not to mention that we, as researchers, are not strong enough to re-enter 
    that place. Oh yes, some of his previous incursions were much smaller in 
    scope but this was a calculated strike. It occurred shortly after Asheron's 
    visit to us. He brought those horrible hollow Olthoi with him, and many 
    other foes.&quot;<br>
    Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I will understand if you no longer 
    want to aid us in this endeavour hero, I too am terrified of what Martine is 
    capable of. But if you choose to go, you should collect as many decanters as 
    you can from within. You look as though you could carry...ten. Yes, ten 
    should be more than enough for you. We should leave some for anyone else 
    that wants to help us don't you think? Collect ten and return to me and I 
    will tell you where you should be focusing next. Be careful though. You must 
    do this within the next three cycle of days, or start over.&quot;</font></p>

    State of the Code</a>:<br>
    <br>
    <b>What are the crafting skill checks needed to create the new Isparian 
    Weapons? </b><br>
    <br>
    The crafting checks are based off of achievable stats at level 50. They take 
    into consideration buffing as well. There has been some player discussion 
    that places the skill checks well beyond the range of what the average 
    player of Asheron's Call could achieve before level 100. This is simply not 
    the case. <br>
    <br>
    With these weapons we introduced a new dynamic in crafting that would allow 
    a player who obtains the lowest quality initial item, in this case a Pyreal 
    Infused Ingot, to have the chance to create the Perfect final version. The 
    skill checks for those interactions are extremely high. <br>
    <br>
    True Alchemists will be best at making the highest quality of Ingot, as has 
    always been the case, and the skill check is very high. But again, the 
    &quot;best&quot; version of the items is meant to be difficult to obtain.</font></span></p>
