Translator in Hebian-to, has been studying the Falatacot. Because he's 
restricted to the library, he needs help with his research. He's hired the 
barkeeps on the Vesayan Isles to carry a note for him, delineating his interest 
in the Moarsmen, which are somehow connected to the Falatcot. Explore the Moars 
dungeons and gather the items you find. They can be combined into portal gems 
which lead you to the Sunken Mere, a multi-level Moarsmen dungeon. Retrieve the 
texts within and return them to Fanzen San for a reward!</font></p>

	asked the barkeeps on the Vesayen Islands to distribute it for me. And since 
	you are here, giving this to me, it appears they did what I had asked.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;With all that has been happening of 
	late I can't help but be intrigued by all of this Falatacot nonsense. So far 
	we've seen a good deal about the under handed side of their people. But we 
	know there is a lighter side to them. A less cruel side.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;We also know that the Moarsmen, the 
	swamp dwelling creatures that were discovered when portals to the Vesayen 
	Islands first opened, have some sort of connection to them. The Adjanites 
	frequently kept them, though we are not exactly certain why.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;I would enjoy the opportunity to learn 
	more about them, but I honestly have very little time outside of my 
	translator duties to devote to researching the moarsmen.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;I know! Since you are here, would you

    Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;It looks almost like a portal gem. But

    Ispar that the Aluvians would make similar objects to place curious or small 
    decorative statues into.&quot;<br>
    Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;Several people have visited me 
    recently with an object that could very well be placed in this. They said 
    they made the gem by combining a pair of items they found on the Vesayen 
    Islands. I recommend exploring the islands further if you haven't already.&quot;<br>
    Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;The stone glows, but it looks very

    exactly. My library on the Adjanites is thin in comparison to what I have

	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;Now that I think of it, several people 
	have come by with a piece of artwork that may very well fit on top of this. 
	They said they got that item from somewhere on the Vesayen Islands, though 
	they were very secretive about where it was they pulled their treasure 
	from.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;Another thing to note is the weight 
	and sound of the dais. It feels very light for being make out of stone, and 
	it sounds like it could be hollow. I see no hinges or doors, perhaps you 
	should take this to Hiro outside of Xarabydun, he may know how to open this 
	casing.&quot;<br>
	Fanzen San the Translator tells you, &quot;But don't take my word for it. Either 
	keep it or take it to Hiro. The choice is yours.&quot;</font></font></p>

    </b>One possible use of your items is to craft portal gems that allow you 
    access to the different levels of the Sunken Mere. Each level has a book 
    that can be translated by Fanzen San for experience. Previously, if you had 
    a jump skill of 480+, you could jump to the different levels of the dungeon. 
    That method is no longer possible and you must use the different portal gems
