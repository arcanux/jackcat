outside of town. I want you to investigate the South Portal Platform and if

from reinforcing their foothold in Glenden Woods.&quot;<br>
Tomo Genza tells you, &quot;I wouldn't advise going on this mission alone though. 
Find others with skills equal to yours to accompany you. Have them talk to me 
before you leave so I know who is in the field. When your done come back and 
report to me, I may have a reward for you.&quot;<br>

retrieve the Viamont Staging Area Key from its corpse (5 min. re-spawn, only 1

barrier, then the Vivimancer which will cause the barrier on the west wall to
