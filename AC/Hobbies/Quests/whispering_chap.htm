	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Hey Maggie! Love the site. 
	Instructions and Pics of the new quest are included.<br>
	<br>
	Begin By talking to Harkwull the Discreet, found in the pub<br>
	<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet tells you, &quot;Ah, excellent... I have been looking for a 
	person of your obvious skill who is loyal to Queen Elysa and the good folk 
	of Silyun... as well as another organization. I seek someone of skill and 
	daring to infiltrate the Summoning Chamber of Count Dardante,, King 
	Varicci's chief thaumaturgical counselor.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet tells you, &quot;You must journey to Sanamar, to the Royal 
	Hall itself, and find the portal to Dardante's Workshop. In there, you must 
	find a way to gain access to his Summoning Chamber, and find what 
	information you can from the spirits that the Count binds and torments 
	there. Bring me what you find, and I will further initiate you into the 
	mysteries of the Whispering Blade.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet tells you, &quot;I must also warn you that if you have made 
	it this far into our confidence and are thinking of making use of those 
	unscrupulous &quot;plumbers&quot; to erase your record of service... Well, suffice it 
	to say, royal archives can be pillaged, but the Whispering Blade does not 
	forget its own.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Enter the Dungeon. Keep working your way down until you reach a room w/ 2 
	portals. Kill the Summoning Chamber Adepts and loot a ring off them. Put the 
	ring on to be flagged to enter the summoning chamber<br>
	The ring is on a 13 day timer.<br>
	<br>
	In the Summoning Chamber, work your way down until you reach a big room. To 
	your right is a room with a surface portal, to the left, a room with a 
	portal to a &quot;Binding Room&quot;, so go left.<br>
	<br>
	In the binding room you will find a &quot;bound fallacot&quot;. Talk to him, dont 
	attack off the bat.<br>
	<br>
	The Bound Falatacot speaks within your mind: &quot;You will serve, man-thing. I 
	had not looked to see another in here, and I can tell you are not one of the 
	minions of the overreaching fool Dardante. Slay me, man-thing, and release 
	me from my torment. I will grant you the knowledge you seek. Be warned, I 
	shall fight back when you attack. The code of my people demands that I go to 
	meet oblivion with blood on my hands and my head unbowed by submission.<br>
	<br>
	Kill him and loot his corpse for an Untranslated Bound Falacot Fragment. He 
	is on a 4 min respawn timer, and the Fragment, like the ring, is a 13 day 
	timer.<br>
	<br>
	Return to Ayan and hand the Fragment to Harkwull for XP, a ring, and a 
	translated text<br>
	<br>
	You give Harkwull the Discreet Untranslated Bound Falatacot Fragment.<br>
	You've earned 6,891,000 experience. (lvl 209, in fellowship but unknown if 
	it shares through fellow)<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet gives you Ring of the Whispering Blade.<br>
	<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet tells you, &quot;What a grisly memento the Falatacot left 
	behind. Still, very curious, and it gives us an insight into Dardante's 
	operations. A job well done. I feel confident in admitting you to the 
	Whispering Blade. You can be trusted to see most of the translation... There 
	are some parts that must still be reserved for our most senior members. On 
	behalf of our Grand Master, I thank you.&quot;<br>
	Harkwull the Discreet gives you Translated Bound Falatacot Fragment.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Text: Translated Bound Falacot Fragment:<br>
	&quot;The mortal meat puppet who calls himself Dardante has bound me in his 
	crudely constructed half-realm longer than I can remember. Where did this 
	callow hedge-sorcerer learn the arts of summoning, manifestation, and 
	binding? His methods are crude and graceless, like a hovel constructed of 
	unshaped logs. But his work is strong enough to hold me against my will and 
	to subject me to the iniquities of physicality. He has been coached well, 
	but his lessons are incomplete.<br>
	He torments me with the basest techniques to compel knowledge from me. It is 
	fortunate that he lacks the power of true command. Humiliating as my 
	captivity has become, at least I have not had the final indignity of having 
	my mind stripped against my will. As it is, I feed him worthless information 
	when the pain becomes too great. All this, I remember and record. All deeds 
	will be accounted for in the turning of the Wheel of All Things.<br>
	Dardante wants to know about Grael. He wants to know how Grael came about 
	his power, and how one might find him. He has learned enough to become a 
	danger to himself and to those around him. He has not learned enough to 
	realize that he is dancing around the Abyss. My laughter enrages him, and I 
	have not yet seen fit to tell him why I find his queries so amusing. How 
	could he know how many lifetimes were wasted pursuing knowledge of the Black 
	Spear of the Kemeroi? I have fed him useless morsels that will only whet his 
	hunger for Grael. I have led him to believe that a man-thing like him may 
	achieve the same power as Grael, without making the same dark bargain that 
	Grael made.<br>
	The man-thing has no idea what kind of catastrophic trouble he courts in his 
	precocious inquiries. Neither I nor any of my kind will do anything to 
	discourage him. Any of my brethren will be able to see the rich harvest of 
	bleeding chaos that this Dardante sows.&quot;<br>
