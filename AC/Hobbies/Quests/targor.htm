	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Hey Maggie! <br>
	Hope you and the baby are doing well! Just wanted to let ya know about a new 
	quest. No lvl restrict as the dungeon is just a hole in the ground. The 
	entrance can be found at 68.4N 66.6E, on the mainland near the vissadel 
	isle. In the beginning you'll be facing raven conscripts with around 3000 
	health. Continue through the dungeon (it makes splits but they all lead to 
	the same place. its very linear early on) until you come across Archon 
	Merille, a lvl 165 Raven Conscript. Kill her and loot the note off her (shes 
	on a 4 min respawn. there is 1 note per body, she may not look the same each 
	time)<br>
	<br>
	Once she is dead, continue on. (The dungeon is no longer linear) You will 
	soon be facing shadows (wretched, twisted, and other such high lvl ones), 
	coupled with the odd Raven Augur (lvl 165 human). Continuing straight in the 
	dungeon you will bump into Dealith (lvl 165 shadow). He has some sweet armor 
	and on his body you'll find a key (only one person needs to get this) as 
	well as a &quot;sticky lump&quot; (needs to be translated in cragstone). He is also 
	accompanied by Tenebrous knights (lvl 165 elementals).<br>
	<br>
	Take the key from Dealith and use it to open the door just past him. Again, 
	continue through the dungeon, this time until you bump into Faurset (lvl 165 
	shadow). Again, kill him and loot. Only 1 person again needs the key off the 
	body. As before, use it to open the door past him.<br>
	<br>
	Again, run until this time you bump into Liantor (lvl 165 shadow). Again, 
	loot a key and continue on through the next door. Now it gets fun<br>
	<br>
	Mukkir! Everyone favorite! You'll be fighting a host of them here this time. 
	You'll face the old regular Mukkir and Barbaric Mukkir, as well as their new 
	friends: the Fanatical Mukkir (lvl 180), the Vile Mukkir (lvl 180), the 
	Coruscating Mukkir (lvl 180). You will eventually come to a dead end. Do not 
	panic! Kill the mukkir in there then get ready! Targor will spawn after a 
	little while. Watch out! He hits hard with both magic and melee attacks.<br>
	<br>
	Thats all i have for now. Targor and his minions with him took down all 5 of 
	us. Hope the info helps! I'll send the rest as soon as i get done with it!<br>

	Isin Dule's Instructions:<br>
	There is an Isparian, known as High Archon Kraest of the Raven Hand, who 
	foolishly seeks to awaken Targor from his long sleep. He has sent those 
	loyal to him to attempt this. We will not allow this to happen. If they gain 
	hold of Targor, they may be able to use him to awaken the Black Spear. <br>
	<br>
	Stop them. Take whatever resources you need, including those more 
	enlightened Raven Hand who have recently joined us. If you cannot stop them 
	from gaining access to Targor, destroy him. His death may awaken some of the 
	other Mukkir who still sleep, but Targor will awaken them all, if they can 
	push him to it. Perhaps even the Black Spear himself. This cannot be allowed 
	to come to pass.<br>
	<br>

	(Note off Body of Archon Merille)<br>
	High Archon Kaest's Instructions:<br>
	Go, my Archon, to the ruin I have identified the location for. There is no 
	portal, so you will have to gain entry through more mundane means. Once you 
	have gained entry, find this Mukkir, this &quot;Targor&quot;. Capture it, bring it to 
	me. I need this Mukkir alive. Let nothing stand in your way.<br>

	<br>
	Here is a small write up for the Necklace of the<br>
	Golden Flame Quest. <br>
	<br>
	Town Crier tells you, &quot;There have been reports of an old Bloodless death 
	cult, called the Raven Hand, searching for something in the northeast of 
	Osteth. This should be investigated.&quot;<br>
	Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are several reports of an old Bloodless death 
	cult, called the Order of the Raven Hand, digging on Osteth, near the shores 
	of Vissidal Island. Along with this, there have been reports of increased 
	&quot;Shadow&quot; activity in the same area. Perhaps those loyal to Sanamar should 
	investigate.&quot;<br>

	High Archon Kraest's Instructions<br>
	&quot;Go, my Archon, to the ruin I have identified the location for. There is no 
	portal, so you will have to gain entry through more mundane means. Once you 
	have gained entry, find this Mukkir, this 'Targor.' Capture it, bring it to

	Dealith - loot key to Outer Locked Gate<br>
	Faurset - loot key to Middle Locked Gate<br>
	Liantor - loot key to Inner Locked Gate<br>
	<br>
	Targor - mukkir in final room<br>
	You hear a voice in your mind say, &quot;I awaken, and my brothers will soon join 
	me.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	At death:<br>
	You hear a voice in your mind, screaming with agony. <br>
	You can barely make out the thought, &quot;Master! Protect me!!&quot;<br>
	At the same time, you hear a sound like shattering crystal.<br>
	<br>
	Loot Frozen Black Crystal<br>
	<br>
	You give Sarkin Killcrane Frozen Black Crystal.<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;What's this?&quot;<br>
	You explain to Sarkin Killcrane how you came to have this shard of black 
	crystal.<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;Hmmm... If what you say is true, then these are 
	dire times indeed. I'll send this to some associates of mine who are good at 
	analyzing such things.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;Hopefully, we can use this to learn more about 
	Grael and these Mukkir... Before the Raven Hand do something we'll all 
	regret.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;It was a great risk you took in acquiring this 
	crystal and bringing it to me. Here, take this medallion. You've earned it.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 29,175,981 experience.<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane gives you Necklace of the Golden Flame.<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">After reading some recent 
	lore I found a mound in NE Osteth. (Shortcut: Rithwic, Isparian Flame 
	settlemnt portals...run north to the beach). It is surrounded by 4 Ravens 
	and inside is a huge underground dungeon. You pretty fight through Ravens, 
	kill a boss, then fight shadows. The shadows have bosses near doors. I think 
	there were 3-4 doors...Anyway, you kill the boss shadow, loot a key, go 
	through the door, rinse, repeat. After the last shadow door you reach a 
	small corridor full of Mukkir.(You will have Dark Spiral flashbacks ;)) The 
	pathway finally widens and you fight numerous high level mukkir. After a few 
	twists and turns, you find Targor. Kill him, loot a crystal, and head for 
	Wai Jhou. Killcrane will take crystal and give you a necklace (lvl 150+ 
	weild), and xp(My fellow members and I got 29 mil). The shadow bosses also 
	drop lore that can be turned in at Crag to bretself. Not a must-have 
	necklace, but it is a fun quest. =]</font></span></p>

	<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;Greetings, I am Shadow Hunter Killcrane. Not a 
	very uplifting title for a Knight of the Golden Flame, I know, but mine is a 
	grim task.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;High Queen Strathelar has bid myself and others 
	like me to follow the shadow wherever it goes. This is a daunting task to be 
	certain.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;Of late, my journeys have led me to following 
	the actions of the Order of the Raven Hand. Their activities have stirred 
	again, particularly near the energies of the center of the Obsidian Plains.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;I tracked a heavily laden party of their agents 
	to the Singularity Bore not but a handful of days ago.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;My Queen's orders were to find the source of 
	the activity of the Raven Hand. My Lady did declare that I may seek the aid 
	of others if need be.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;Travel to the Singularity Caul, seek out the 
	Order of the Raven Hand, and find what it is that now draws those 
	Shadow-worshipping miscreants to that island and return to me with your 
	findings. Reports from adventurers tell of cultist campsites in the 
	southern, eastern, and western portions of the island.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	You allow Sarkin Killcrane to examine your Frozen Black Crystal.<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;A crystal fragment from Targor? Give that to 
	Riordin, over there. He is collecting the pieces for our associates in the 
	Order.&quot;<br>
	You allow Sarkin Killcrane to examine your Sticky Lump.<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane tells you, &quot;No thank you. I have no need to get that... 
	thing... on me. I can't read those anyways. Why don't you take that to 
	Bretself, in Cragstone, to get translated. I hear he likes those things.&quot;<br>
	Sarkin Killcrane doesn't know what to do with that.<br>
	<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;I have been brought here to assist Sarkin 
	Killcrane in the collection of the Frozen Black Crystals he has been 
	receiving from adventurers as of late. If you wish to try to retrieve one of 
	these crystals for us, I have heard that they can be found on a Mukkir named 
	Targor. Targor seems to be a part of an ongoing conflict between the Raven 
	Hand and a group of Shadows up around 68.4N, 66.6E.&quot;<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;Shadows actually trying to stop the Raven 
	Hand... Will wonders never cease.&quot;<br>
	You give Riordin Nightbane Frozen Black Crystal.<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;Ahh, a frozen crystal shard. The mages in the 
	Order have had some luck with figuring out what this was. It seems that this 
	is a fragment of some sort of Totem, similar to the Ice Totems built by the 
	Ruschk.&quot;<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;We haven't been able to reconstruct the totem 
	yet, as the pieces are small and badly damaged, but we are hoping to collect 
	enough pieces to reconstruct at least one complete totem.&quot;<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;It is our hope to use this totem to learn more 
	about the Mukkir, and possibly make a weapon against them.&quot;<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;It was a great risk and noble act that you 
	undertook in acquiring this crystal and bringing it here. Sarkin has given 
	me these medallions to award to those whom have aided us in this.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 3,967,448 experience.<br>
	Riordin Nightbane gives you Necklace of the Golden Flame.<br>
	<br>
	You allow Riordin Nightbane to examine your Sticky Lump.<br>
	Riordin Nightbane tells you, &quot;Oh no, Sarkin warned me about those things. 
	Why don't you take that to Bretself, in Cragstone, to get translated. He can 
	read them for you.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Bretself the Translator tells you, &quot;I study Empyrean history of Lord 
	Asheron's era, which we call the Empyrean Era of Lore. If you have a text 
	from that time, perhaps I may be of service.&quot;<br>
	You give Bretself the Translator Sticky Lump.<br>
	Bretself the Translator tells you, &quot;Ugh... I really wish someone would teach 
	these Shadows the use of proper paper...&quot;<br>
	Bretself shudders momentarily, and then begins to translate the lump.<br>
	Bretself the Translator tells you, &quot;Fascinating... According to this, it 
	looks like Isin Dule is trying to stop the Raven Hand from awakening Grael. 
	Here, take a look.&quot;<br>
	Bretself the Translator gives you Isin Dule's Instructions.</font></span></p></td>
