	Great site :) Running through the dires I came across some banderling 
	aggressors. After hitting a few a Dire Champion Banderling spawned. On it, 
	it had a Dire Champion Token. I gave this to Aun Javhalrea, the Game Warden 
	in Ayan and he awarded me with 5 Million XP and the title of Banderling 
	Bully. Not sure if it's new or not but couldn't find on your site! Please

	Sanddh of WE sends this summary: &quot;Eyas Maggie, After running around the 
	Dires killing almost anything on my way, I found in total 8 sort of Dire 
	Champions. Since after the 8th different Champion I got a new title (see 
	screenies) for tracking these 8, I guess this is it.<br>
	<br>
	Usually, I had to wait for the spawn to fully develop. However, I didn't 
	need to finish the spawn completely before the champion spawned. Single 
	creatures of the same species never gave me a champ. <br>
	<br>
	Since even after killing 5 or more fully developed spawns of the following 
	critters, I guess they don't give champions (yet): grievvers, shrets, 
	tummies, sclavii, mossies, dillos, olthoi, guruk &amp; burun, undead (tried the 
	mu'miyads and the phantasm/darkmaster ones), moarsmen, and the critters that 
	usually spawn alone, such as wisps, zefirs and crystals.<br>
	<br>
	My list :)<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Bandie<br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a bandie-only spawn of Agressors and such<br>
	Title: Banderling Bully<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Virindi <br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a mixed spawn of virindi, hollows and tuskers<br>
	Title: Xenophobic<br>
	(Utterly btw, as an archer I hated this one, did very little damage, and 
	took ages to kill because of his armor and his heal and drain spells)<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Drudge <br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a drudge-only spawn of Bloodletters, Peerless &amp; 
	Cabalists<br>
	Title: Dire Drudge Decapitator<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Lugie h)<br>
	Found around: AB<br>
	Spawned after killing a lugie only spawn of Titans and Juggernauts<br>
	Title: Renegade Hunter <br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Shadow <br>
	Found: near Dires coast between AB and CK, close to withered tummie area<br>
	Spawned after killing a shadow-only spawn of Abyssal, Sinister, Tenebrous<br>
	Title: Shadow Sunderer <br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Golem <br>
	Found: near Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a golem only spawn of Gold Golems<br>
	Title: Gold Farmer<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Skellie <br>
	Found: coast east of Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a skellie only spawn of armored skellies and skeletal 
	heroes (I guess the Dark Myrmidon was a coincidence ;) )<br>
	Title: Antropologist<br>
	<br>
	Dire Champ Monouga<br>
	Found: northeast of Teth<br>
	Spawned after killing a monouga-only spawn of Bloodthirsty, Pugnacious and 
	Insidious<br>
	Title: Third Eye Blinder<br>
