	<p>Silvana Nightsong/Moeko of HG reports: &quot;Heya Maggie! I just spoke with an 
	NPC near the armorer in Holt named Dwennon (42.6N 33.5E) and apparently he's 
	contracted mad cow disease! He asks you to tip the cows to thwart their evil 
	schemes!&quot; Thanks also to Hirad of WE!</p>
	<p><font face="arial" size="2">NPC:
	<a href="../../npc.asp-npcID=1704.html">Dwennon</a> 
	- 42.6N, 33.6E (Holtburg)</font></p>
	<p><font color="#FFFF99">
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;You've seen them lingering around town, haven't you? 
	They've been here all along, you know that, don't you? They have spies all 
	over the place. They see and hear everything. They must be stopped, and 
	stopped the only way we know how. Simply killing them isn't good enough, we 
	need to tip them and tip them often. Go, go tip the cows, they must be 
	stopped!&quot; </font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Tip the cow.<br>
	You think to yourself &quot;One tip down, I wonder how many more this guy could 
	possibly expect..</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Dwennon tells you, &quot;Good, good, our plans are working, 
	they're being distracted. We've bought some time but you need to buy us more 
	time. We need more time!&quot; </font></p>
	<p>--50 Tips<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The cows lips do not move 
	but you would almost swear you just heard &quot;Moooo, Mooo Mooooooo!&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Dwennon 
	tells you, &quot;Huh!? What's that!&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;Oh... my... goodness. The cows must have had control of 
	my brain, I didn't even know you were there.&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;They're in my head, get them out. Get them out! Tip more 
	cows!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	</font>--100 Tips<br>
	<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">A thought pops into your 
	head &quot;Cow Logic&quot; and you think... &quot;What's that?&quot; Maybe you can ask Dwennon 
	about it some day.<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;Mooooooooooo!!!! Mooo! Mo.&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;I'm practicing my cow speak. Now if only I could lose 
	this darn accent.&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;You should return to the field. I've never met a more 
	formidable tipper. You shall be a hero of the people when the Cow Insurgence 
	is stopped!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	</font>--150 Tips<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You think to yourself &quot;I 
	must be at least half done, and if not then Dwennon can just finish tipping 
	this cow himself.&quot;<br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;They've been herding at night again. They can't fool me 
	though. No one can sleep standing up! I can see their lips moving in cow 
	whispers. I can hear the whispers late at night. They're up to something! 
	You tip those cows. Give those treacherous bovine a good shove for me!&quot;<br>
	<br>
	</font>--200 Tips<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Your arms are getting 
	tired, you think to yourself &quot;I must have tipped at least 200 times by now.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;Moo Mo mooo moooooo moooo mo moo mooooo?&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;Ahem, or... Moo Mo mooo mooooo mooo moo mo moooo?&quot;<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;Don't stop tipping now, you've tipped 200 or so by my 
	count. Have you got your tippin' calluses yet? Those are a sign of 
	distinction my friend.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	</font>--250 Tips<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Unless you lost track 
	someplace along the way, which you think is very possible at this point, you 
	believe that's your 250th tip. What, no fireworks? Maybe you have a few more 
	tips to go still.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	<br>
	Dwennon tells you, &quot;We're almost there, I can sense it. The cow brain waves 
	have been interupted. I know you can sense it also.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	</font>--300 Tips<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
	</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">It seems to you like you 
	have done enough tipping for now, maybe Dwennon in Holtburg has an update 
	for you...</font><font color="#66FF99"><br>
	</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Dwennon tells you, &quot;Good, those cows will be set for a 
	while, you can take a break. I expect you to report back here tomorrow to 
	continue though, we can't let down our guard. Even better, search out cows 
	around the world and tip them. They must all be stopped.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You've earned 10,000 experience.<br>
	You are Obviously Bored, maybe you should check your titles.<br>
	Dwennon gives you Tipped Pack Cow.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Dwennon tells you, &quot;Don't tell them I gave that to 
	you, you don't want to see them when they get very mad.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	You get get a Tipped Pack Cow that, when hooked, lays on its side and kicks 
	its legs in the air. You also get the title of &quot;Obviously Bored&quot;!<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for running such a great site, Maggie! We love ya!&quot;</p>
