introduced in the Flesh and Blood event, can be started in any of the three
starter towns: Yaraq, Holtburg or Shoushi. <span lang="en-us">[Ken Troop 
comments that the quest may be bugged if you start in Holtburg.]</span> Dungeons
are restricted to levels 20+ and you should give yourself a few hours to
complete all the steps. The following walk-through describes the quest beginning
in Yaraq.<br>
<br>
<b><span lang="en-us">Dame Tsaya in Yaraq</span></b><br>
Begin by speaking to Dame Tsaya in the</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">tower
(21.0S<span lang="en-us">,</span> 0.8W). She directs you to a Stranger in Town (23.7S<span lang="en-us">,</span> 2.8<span lang="en-us">W</span>)
who tells you to make sure and visit the Darkened Halls. Dame Tsaya asks you to
bring back whatever you find there<span lang="en-us">.</span> </font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya 
tells you, &quot;Hail, adventurer! Queen Elysa recently appointed me to lead the 
garrison here in Yaraq. She was deeply grieved when the 12 Training Halls were 
destroyed and wants to ensure that no harm will come to her subjects here.&quot;<br>
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;To that end, I have a small task for you: We have heard 
that a newcomer to this town has moved into a villa that has lain abandoned for 
many years. No one knows where he came from, although it is said he speaks with 
a Northern accent. Would you stop by his residence, and find out more about him? 
He lives to the southwest, near Lubziklan al-Luq's apple orchards.&quot;</font></font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Stranger in Town tells you, 
&quot;Greetings, my friend, greetings! Welcome to my humble home. The hurly-burly of 
Marae Lassel proved too much for me, so I've decided to move here and call Yaraq 
home. Blend in. Make some friends among the peaceful townsfolk. In fact, I've 
made a good friend over in the Darkened Halls. He's recently moved here too. Why 
don't you pay him a visit as well? I'm sure he'd be happy to meet you and make 
you feel right at home.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;The stranger actually asked you to visit his new &quot;friend&quot; 
down in the Darkened Halls? That dismal place is has always been just the lair 
of some lowly Drudges, to my knowledge...perhaps you should investigate this 
matter. If you find anything out of the ordinary, I'd appreciate it if you 
brought it to me for inspection. Something just doesn't sound quite right.&quot;
</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> <br>
<br>
<b><span lang="en-us">Darkened Halls</span> </b> <br>
The Darkened Halls are located at (20.7S<span lang="en-us">,</span>  0.7E<span lang="en-us">
(restricted to levels 20+</span>)<span lang="en-us">. Head to the bottom. You'll
enter a room with a purple chest. Screams echo within the chamber and a Captured
Adventurer hangs suspending between streams of energy. Another figure lies
motionless on the ground. The chest is guarded by a group of Hollow Minions
(level 23). To open the chest you'll need a key held by a special level 30
Hollow Minion. Inside the chest you'll find <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm"> An Unsigned Message</a> and a Human
Husk. Ick! The Minion is on a 5 minutes spawn. Return the Husk to Dame Tsaya and
you will receive 5,000xp, 3 Wood Golem Hearts and a <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm">letter</a>, along with
instructions to take it to Sir Rylanan in Holtburg.</span>&nbsp; </font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya 
turns to you gravely.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;Yes, what did you discover up in 
the Darkened Halls?&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">You give Dame Tsaya Human Husk.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">Appalled, Dame Tsaya gingerly handles the human 
husk and covers it with a linen cloth.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;You found this in the Darkened 
Halls? Poor soul. I can only wonder what he went through in his last tortures. 
What dark intent could spur the Hollow Minions into committing such an atrocity? 
No wonder that stranger asked you so nicely to visit his comrades in those 
Halls--he must have been seeded here to send weak, innocent victims to their 
deaths--luckily he failed in taking your measure. I must write Sir Rylanan 
immediately and alert him to the crimes being committed here. But first, I must 
reward you for your discoveries here today.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You have been awarded 5,000 experience.<br>

<font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya gives you Dame Tsaya's Letter to Sir Rylanan.</font>
<br>
<br>
<b><span lang="en-us">Sir Rylanan in Holtburg</span></b><br>
Head to Holtburg and give Dame Tsaya's note to Sir Rylanan (41.6N<span lang="en-us">,</span> 34.2E).
He will send you to 
investigate a house at 42.8N<span lang="en-us">,</span> 29.5E where a
&quot;reformed&quot; bandit lives<span lang="en-us">.</span>
<span lang="en-us">K</span>ill the Hollow Minions in the lower level and bring
the <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm"> Cryptic Note</a> which one carries back to Sir Rylanan. From there he will
direct you to Asuger Temple.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan 
tells you, &quot;I see you've just come over from Yaraq. Did Dame Tsaya send a letter 
with you? She has always been so good about updating her reports.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Sir Rylanan Dame Tsaya's Letter to Sir Rylanan.<br>
Sir Rylanan reads the letter from Dame Tsaya with great interest and growing 
concern.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;What terrible</font>
<font color="#FFFF99">news! It sounds as if Tsaya has her hands full down in 
Yaraq. A human husk, torn from a living being, I shudder to think of it.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;Well, I have had some interesting 
times myself. I've recently been assigned to Holtburg to build a garrision and 
be on the lookout for suspicious happenings. There is one fellow on the 
outskirts of town that I've been keeping my eye on. He's just moved here from 
Marae Lassel and sometimes comes into town for provisions. He says he's been 
&quot;reformed&quot;, but I can spot a bandit when I see one! Townsfolk say they've 
spotted shady-looking guests coming and going from his house at odd hours. Could 
you go check on him? His house lies to the northwest of town, past the Holtburg 
West Training Academy.&quot;</font></font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;You're back! 
How did your interview with that ex-bandit go? Did you find anything of note in 
his house?&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You give Sir Rylanan A 
Cryptic Note.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;You say you found this note in that bandit's house? 
Surrounded by a pack of Hollow Minions? I knew that fellow was up to no good! 
Look here...it refers to Asuger Temple, up to the north. Last I heard, the 
temple was just a Banderling hideout...harmless really. I wonder what sort of 
trouble might be brewing up there? Find out what is going on, and I'm sure I 
could find something in the Guard's coffers to reward you with.&quot;
</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> <br>
<br>
<b><span lang="en-us">Asuger Temple</span></b><br>
Asuger Temple is located at 45.1N<span lang="en-us">,</span> 30.4E<span lang="en-us"> 
(restricted to levels 20+</span>)<span lang="en-us">.</span>  Again you will be
fighting Hollow Minions. One drops a key which opens a Storage Chest containing
a Glass Spherule. Again, the spawn time for the key-bearing Hollow Minion is 5
minutes. Bring a friend or two along as the spawn of the other Hollows is a
little fast. You may also encounter some Banderling Bezerkers. Take the Glass
Spherule&nbsp; back to Sir Rylanan for a reward of 10,000xp and 3 Copper Hearts.
You'll also receive a <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm"> note</a> to take to Sir Thenshin in Shoushi.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan 
tells you, &quot;I see you've returned from Asuger Temple in one piece. Did you find 
anything out of the ordinary while you were there?&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">
You give Sir Rylanan Glass Spherule.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;What a strange object! Perfectly round, and perfectly 
smooth!&quot;<br>
Sir Rylanan holds the spherule up to the light and stares into the milky glass.<br>
Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;What substance could possibly be swirling around in 
there? Looks like portal space energy, doesn't it?&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Sir Rylanan starts to shake the spherule but suddenly 
thinks better of it.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;I am out of my depth here...the 
mages of the Arcanum might be able to fathom this object's purpose. I will send 
it to the Arcanum for analysis. I should now reward you for your aid in 
investigating this matter.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You have been awarded 10,000 experience.<br>
Sir Rylanan gives you Copper Heart.<br>
Sir Rylanan gives you Copper Heart.<br>
Sir Rylanan gives you Copper Heart.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Rylanan tells you, &quot;I believe Sir Tenshin would be 
very interested to hear about your discoveries. He is heading up the garrision
[sic] down in Shoushi. This letter will serve as your introduction to him--I have 
chronicled your discoveries, as well as the contents of the note you found 
earlier.&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">Sir Rylanan gives you Sir Rylanan's Letter to Sir 
Tenshin.<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
</font>
<b><span lang="en-us">Sir Tenshin in Shoushi</span></b><br>
Take Sir Rylanan's note to Sir Tenshin in Shoushi (32.8S<span lang="en-us">,</span> 73.3E).
Sir Tenshin will send you to investigate a farm at 37.4S<span lang="en-us">,</span> 75.5E.
The Ostentatious Farmer warns you away from the front of his shop where the heat
from the fire is very intense. But, of course, the real reason for his warning
is the trap door located there! It leads down into a small dungeon full of Swamp
Rats. A secret passage-way opens up when you pull on&nbsp; a candle. At the end
of the corridor you'll find a Storage Chest containing a Folded Guard's Uniform
and a <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm"> Folded
Note</a>. Take the Uniform to Sir Tenshin for a reward of 15,000xp and
3 Obsidian Golem Hearts. You'll receive another <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm">note</a>, this time from Sir Tenshin
to Dame Tsaya in Yaraq.</font><p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Sir Tenshin tells you, 
&quot;Greetings. Sir Rylanan mentioned he might be sending updates to me from 
Holtburg every so often. Might he have sent one with you?&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">You give Sir Tenshin Sir Rylanan's Letter to Sir 
Tenshin.<br>
Sir Tenshin reads the letter from Sir Rylanan with no small amount of amazement 
and disgust.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;A glass spherule encapulating what 
looks as if it could be portal space energy? And what's this? Husks made from 
human skins? Poor Rylanan and Tsaya--they have more to deal with than they 
signed up for, I'll wager. Hollow Minions playing around with portal space and 
harvesting the skin off of people's backs--no good will come of it. Mark my 
words...&quot;<br>
Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;Come to think of it, I've remarked on some suspicious 
characters lately myself. Perhaps you can help me. There is a farmer who lives a 
little ways past the Shoushi South Outpost. He's been a normal townsmember for a 
very long time, but no one can speak for how he's come into so much wealth 
recently. Normally it's a cause to celebrate when one's neighbor moves up in the 
world...but why is he acting so distantly when he comes to town to stock up on 
provisions?&quot;<br>
Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;Could you go and check in on him? I am sure there is 
nothing amiss, but after hearing all of this I have to be sure...&quot;</font></font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">
Ostentatious Farmer tells you, &quot;Welcome to my grand opening! You are welcome to 
peruse my wares...but please, stay to the front of my shop--the heat from the 
fire is very strong, and I don't want you to get burned.&quot;<br>
Ostentatious Farmer tells you, &quot;Thank you for your patronage. Now please be on 
your way, I have much work to do.&quot;</font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;There you are! Have you found out what that farmer's 
secret is? Let me know if he's been hoarding anything that could be 
considered...unusual in his house.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Sir Tenshin Folded Guard's Uniform.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;You say you found this Guard's 
uniform in a hidden room in the farmer's basement? What's more, he had many of 
them? And he's stockpiling a large armament as well?&quot;<br>
Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;How could he have found access to these uniforms? These 
are the sole property of Her Majesty's Guard--and are dispensed only through our 
headquarters. They must have been stolen whilst our quartermaster was in his 
cups...I will alert our Queen of this affair immediately. Thank you for your 
help--here is your reward.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You have been awarded 15,000 experience.<br>
Sir Tenshin gives you Obsidian Heart.<br>
Sir Tenshin gives you Obsidian Heart.<br>

<font color="#FFFF99">Sir Tenshin tells you, &quot;I believe Dame Tsaya in Yaraq 
should be alerted to this affair as well. Please take this letter to her--I have 
included your recent discoveries. I'm sure she will be highly interested to hear 
of what you have found.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Sir Tenshin gives you Sir Tenshin's Letter to Dame Tsaya.</font><br>
<br>
<b><span lang="en-us">Fort Witshire</span></b><br>
When you return to Yaraq and give the note to Dame Tsaya, she will give you a
key to Fort Witshire and direct you to the underground passage<span lang="en-us">
(restricted to 
levels 20+)</span>. <span lang="en-us">You can access the passage via the purple 
portal behind Dame Tsaya inside the tower. </span>The underground passage will take you inside the walled
fort. Watch out for more Hollow Minions and some Drudge Prowlers<span lang="en-us"> 
when you exit</span>. 
</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Use the key on the Cottage door (or
use lockpick, difficulty 170). A trap door inside the cottage will take you into
the dungeon. As you work your way to the bottom you'll be fighting numerous
Hollow Minions and Martinate Simulacrum. <span lang="en-us">Keep to the left 
whenever possible to reach the bottom. </span>The final trophy, <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Elysa.htm"> Menacet's
Orders</a>, is
on a level 43 Hollow Minion named Dranith Manecet. You'll definitely want a
friend or two along to help fight the spawns. Dranith Manecet is on a 5 minute
spawn. Take the note back to either Dame Tsaya, Sir 
Rylanan, or Sir Tenshin. You will get Elysa's Favor as a reward -- a magical ring that casts 
Life giver (+15 hp) and one of 4 random spells. You will also receive two Sturdy
Iron Keys<span lang="en-us">.&nbsp;</span>
</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">The rings may be
dropped or given away. Quest timer is  2 weeks, so if you didn't
get your preferred ring, the wait isn't too long before you can try again!</span></font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya 
tells you, &quot;I am mentoring Sir Tenshin in the responsibilities that come with 
being the leader of an important garrison. Did he send any letters for me along 
with you? I do like to keep track of his progress.&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#66FF99">You give Dame Tsaya Sir Tenshin's Letter to Dame 
Tsaya.</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya quickly glances over the letter from her 
comrade in Shoushi and muses aloud.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I have no doubt now that what has 
occurred here and in Holtburg and Shoushi are connected. Rylanan reports that 
the Hollow Minions are siphoning portal energy into concentrated spherules of 
glass. Tenshin tells me that a man has been discovered hoarding weapons and 
stolen Guard's uniforms. And the terrible atrocities here in Yaraq, under my own 
watch...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya abruptly comes to a conclusion.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;The Hollow Minions are creating 
their own Simulacra by somehow channeling portal space energy into these poor 
human husks. I have no doubt their plan was to clothe their Simulacra in our 
uniforms to infiltrate the Guard. Our Queen is in danger, and we must put a stop 
to this.&quot;<br>
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I have received reports that a band of Hollow Minions 
have barricaded themselves into Fort Witshire. I am now confident that the fort 
must house the headquarters of this plot.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya sizes you up speculatively.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I believe I have just the plan. 
Fort Witshire was built upon the ruins of an old Empyrean prison. We can 
infiltrate the fort if we first go through its lower passageways. We created 
this portal to reach the prison, and I have only been waiting for the right 
person to grant permission to use it--and I now believe that person is you.&quot;<br>
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;Press onwards to the top, and when you enter Fort 
Witshire itself, try to find out who is commanding the Hollow Minions there. 
This key may be of good use once you enter the fort--it was found among 
Witshire's effects when he left the fort. I cannot emphasize how much I believe 
the Queen's safety depends on this. Good luck.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Dame Tsaya gives you Copy of Witshire's Key.</font></font><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I see you have come back from the Fort in one piece. Do 
you have any more interesting finds for me?&quot;<br>
Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I see you have come back from the Fort in one piece. Do 
you have any more interesting finds for me?&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Dame Tsaya Menacet's Orders.<br>
Dame Tsaya sighs deeply and shuts her eyes after reading the contents of the 
folded note.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Dame Tsaya tells you, &quot;I was right, in all except one 
thing. It was Borelean's life at stake, not Elysa's. And to attempt his murder 
through us, the Queen's own Guard...an audacious plan. Martine deserves no mercy 
for this, you have my word. We of the Strathelar Guard owe you a great debt for 
warding off what would have been a terrible tragedy--especially for Elysa and 
Asheron.&quot;</font><br>
