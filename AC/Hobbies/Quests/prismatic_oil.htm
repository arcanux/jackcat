	<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum 
	Alchemist tells you, &quot;The four Essences have returned to world. They have 
	been seen near the broken menhir rings that once focused and held them. From 
	what I've been able to surmise from our Arcanum Agents, the Essences are 
	much more aggressive than they once were. Perhaps Gaerlan's tinkering with 
	the elemental forces has changed them.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Yes, you look skilled enough.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist gives you Instructions for 
	Essence Recovery.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;All of the 
	Arcanum's attempts at collecting samples from the four Essences have failed. 
	Fifteen of our best agents were defeated in a recent attempt on the Essence 
	of Verdancy. Find yourself a group of adventurers at least as powerful as 
	you before you go anywhere near these new Essences.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;First, you need to retrieve four 
	Enchanted Decanters from the Arcanum Research Facility outside of Al-Jalima. 
	You will use these decanters to collect each Essence's essence. The details 
	are in these instructions.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Good luck and don't underestimate the 
	power of the Essences. They are raw magic after all.&quot;</font><br>
	<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of 
	Essence of Enchantment.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of 
	Enchantment! You didn't get any on you I hope. I theorize that this essence 
	could have dangerous effects if it comes in contact with a creature. I'll 
	have to be very careful while I'm testing this.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of 
	Essence of Artifice.<br>
	You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of Essence of Strife.</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">You give Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist Decanter of 
	Essence of Verdancy.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Ah, Essence of 
	Verdancy! It's a good thing this decanter is enchanted or the essence would 
	have eaten right through it and through the floor stones and through the 
	ground beneath. In fact I don't think it would stop until it reached it's 
	source.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Let's see, where did I put those 
	enchanted gloves.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I've been studying some of the 
	essences people have brought me. These new Essences seem to be extremely 
	powerful and extremely unstable and I think I may know why.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I think the Cistern's have filled 
	with elemental essence again, but without the Menhir Rings focusing and 
	stabilizing these energies they have... overflowed, more like a discharge 
	really, resulting in these new Essences. With the Cistern's spilling 
	elemental energy the Essences will keep returning and gathering energy. 
	Fascinating, but not good.&quot;<br>
	Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;I have to compare the new samples 
	against some of the samples from the old Essences. You've brought me more 
	than enough of each Essence for my purposes. Give me a second and I'll give 
	you your reward.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">Ciandra combines a small amount of each essence into a 
	small vial of viscous red oil. She holds the bottle up to the light and 
	watches as the oil clears. Prismatic colors can be seen spinning in vial.<br>
	</font><font color="#FFFF99">Ciandra, Arcanum Alchemist tells you, &quot;Here you 
	go. This oil works on the same principle of elemental energies that the 
	Prismatic Plume uses. Apply this oil to a piece of Greater Amuli Shadow 
	Armor and you should be able to instill it with an impressive amount of 
	elemental protection. If you would prefer a different reward then give me 
	back the Prismatic Oil and I'll see what I can do.&quot;</font><br>

	</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Heyas Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	Ok, so I logged in, talked to a town crier who mentioned Ciandra had new 
	stuff to deal with, and the essences being back. Adding this to the 
	exclusive teaser pics, I was hoping to get upgraded stuff for the atlans, 
	but turns out it is for GSA.<br>
	<br>
	Anywayz, here's what happened.<br>
	<br>
	I went to see Ciandra, and she gave me a note that said to visit the 
	essences, and be prepared to die since 15 of her kind died at the verdancy 
	essence (screenies 9&amp;10). So, teaming up, we first had to pick up some empty 
	decanters.<br>
	<br>
	That done, we went to the first essence, the former creature essence, as 
	named in the note. Turns out the returned essence wasnt at the original 
	location, but around 52.3N 62.1E. The Essence was back for sure, but not 
	nicely staying in place and passive as it used to be, but quite 
	aggressive.... Debuffed and dispelled critter spells btw. One-shot me with 
	something I don't remember.<br>
	Also accompanied by about 4 glacial knights. We used fire weapons at first, 
	but later on we found out bludgeon worked better on the knights. The knights 
	tended to do gossamer flesh, cold vuln you, and blast away.&nbsp; Damage 
	done by melees on knights seemed to vary immensely, sometimes my UA only did 
	8 damage, or up to 50 unimped. I suspect they somehow counterbuff sometimes, 
	but not always, since attacking them from back or front didn't make a 
	difference (and they werent using shields). Lotsa rings and walls, and also 
	arcs from the essence.</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	After dieing miserably a few times with 3 people, we got enforcements in, 
	and managed to kill the essence. All essences seem to spawn &quot;Hand of [type]&quot; 
	when they are at half health.<br>
	<br>
	Learning quickly, we found out that dragging first the knights out 
	(preferably one by one) and then the essence hoping the Hands would stay put 
	worked best. Knights are pretty persistent and follow you a long way... On 
	death, the essence dropped Crystallized Essence of [type].<br>
	<br>
	On to the next essence, the former Item one near Landbrigde Villas. The 
	pattern follows the old elemental path btw, like Gaerlan's quest and for the 
	rainbow helmet, so frost by the former critter one, lightning by the former 
	item one, acid by life, and fire by war. Of course use the opposite attack 
	at each, except bludge for the knights. <br>
	<br>
	The Item one was a bit downhill from the old item essence, on the prop side, 
	about 86.5S 11.1E. Galvanic Knights and the essence itself. Here we all got 
	our weapons debuffed and dispelled. Learning quickly, and no deaths ;). 
	Again, the Hands spawned at the essence being half health. On death, the 
	essence dropped again the crystallized essence. Btw, the hands give no xps 
	at all, which doesn't help vitae ;).<br>
	<br>
	Thinking we had our tactics covered, we went for Life. Right... No wonder 
	Ciandra warned us specifically about this one.<br>
	Again Knights, Caustic ones this time and the Essence of Verdancy which 
	dropped a crystallized essence around 31S, 73.5W. The Knights went down 
	quick enough... but... not just your life gets debuffed and dispelled (I at 
	least saw Canker Flesh, only Kings casted that one as far as I knew). But 
	for all, I got my stam completely sucked out and died because all of my 
	health was drained at once. Here we found out the essence luckily regens 
	very very slowly, since we had to run back a long way when we died. <br>
	<br>
	After losing vitae, we went for the essence of strife (71.4N 2.5W). After 
	the life essence, we were a bit wary about what would be tossed our way, but 
	compared to the Essence of Verdancy, it was relatively easy ;). Magic Def 
	got debuffed, and the wars were very varied, but the lure out tactic worked 
	out well. Again Knights (Incendiary), the Essence of Strife, which dropped a 
	crystallized essence, and some Hands that spawned at half health.<br>
	<br>
	Result was 4 crystallized essences. Using the decanters on them gave 4 
	different Decanter of Essence. Handing this in to Ciandra made her give you 
	prismatic Oil. ID-ing it said to use it on Greater Shadow Amuli, so I 
	browsed mules. Found out it doesn't work on sharded GSA. Got myself a new 
	coat, and the result was a prismatic coat. Upped AL, upped elemental prots (unparallelled) 
	and 2 wards: Storm and Frost. Guess the legs will give the other 2 wards, 
	but the oil is one time use only. Don't know if it would work on Celdon or 
	Kijouja, but description only said Amuli.<br>
	<br>
	All in all a very fun quest, resulting in (for me) a nice looking piece of 
	armor looking good on a mule I'm afraid. <br>
	<br>
	O yah, the original team was Flenop, Elrihm and me, luckily quickly joined 
	by Cyns, Bone King's Sword, and Obyron.<br>
