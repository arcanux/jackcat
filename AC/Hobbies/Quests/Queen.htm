  So you want to wear the title of Queen Slayer! Here is how to go about that,

  trigger the quest.</font></p>

  <span lang="en-us">For all the bell parts, you'll need to get 5 of each. In 
  the East Fork Dam Hive you'll encounter Chaos and Vapor

  and <a href="../../Pets/olthoi.htm">Olthoi</a> Legionaires and Nobles. </span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Inside there is 
  a lever operated door and the respawn is quite fast. You may want to have one 
  person operate the lever while the rest of the team makes their way to the 
  chest room. (This part may be soloed, but you probably want 2 people minimum.)</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you enter, 
  you'll be at the top of a ramp facing west. Head west down the ramp, then jump 
  backwards into the waterfall and run forward. (The water does bludgeon damage 
  - wear protection!) Hug the east wall to your right shoulder and run north. 
  When you turn the corner heading east, there will be a ramp up on your right 
  heading south. Take the ramp up and open the door. At the east end of the hall 
  is the level room. Station your level puller here.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">From the lever 
  room take the hallway heading south. Take the east ramp down on the left. Next 
  take the south ramp down on the right to a large room. Turn left (east) and 
  exit the room, then run all the way to the wall at the end. Take the ramp to 
  your right down heading east, and at the bottom turn left, heading east again. 
  Hug the wall to the left and you'll come to the Acid Pool.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Keeping the 
  wall to your left shoulder, run through the acid to the a door and open it 
  using lockpick. Head up the ramp and you'll find the door that the lever 
  opens. Once the door is open, take the first opening on the left. The Rusty 
  Chest is in the SW corner of the room (difficulty 350). Wait for it to lock 
  again before re-looting the Piece of Curved Metal (no-give, spawns every 
  couple of minutes). Once you have 5 of them, head over to the room across the 
  hall and take the NE exit. Take the ramp up on your left heading west, then 
  open the doors and jump into the portal below. You'll exit at 48.4N, 76.7W</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
  <br>
  Solo<span lang="en-us"> method</span>: go to the lock pick door and cast weaken lock on it. Run back and pull 
  the lever. Run back to lock pick door, open and continue up to lever door. Do 
  NOT fight. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: The pit 
  in the East Fork Dam contains Undead, Diamond Golems and an Ossauary which 
  gives the following message:</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
  <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FF99">As you approach the coffin, a 
  cool, detached contralto voice echoes through the hall. She speaks in an 
  Empyrean dialect; soon enough her voice forms recognizable words within your 
  mind. &quot;Here is the chevaird Ghalin Surconit, laid where he fell before the 
  servants of our prey. We were nearly there, my trueblood. You shall be 
  avenged. So swears Lady Rajael.&quot;</font></span></p>

  Run across the river to the other side and enter the Dam Management building. 
  The chest for the Sheet of Curved Metal is in the back. Again you'll need to 
  get 5 of them. Repair the bell by attaching the second piece onto the first.<br>

  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">Inside you'll encounter Vapor and Diamond Golems, Synnasts 
  and Scathisa. It's not necessary to fight any of them to retrieve the Pyreal 
  Mace. When you enter the Hive, you'll be facing West. Run down the stairs and 
  the ramp heading west. At the waterfall, jump facing backwards then run 
  forward to the wall. Turn right heading south and run along the wall until you 
  turn the left corner heading east. Head up the ramp and continue north, 
  passing the Diamond Golem room.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you reach 
  the locked door, use lockpick to open it (dif 402) then continue up the ramp. 
  At the top, head north again passing the elementals. You're heading for the 
  locked door just beyond the levers. Use lockpick again to open it (dif 402), 
  then shut it behind you. Pick the Rusty Chest and retrieve the Pyral Mace. 
  Repair the bell by combining the partially repaired bell and pyreal mace. Once 
  the bell is repaired, it may be given! Store the 5 bells until you are ready 
  to begin the quest.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

  entrance room and look for the ramp next to the North Fork Hive portal. </span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">The steps are 
  the same. The runner takes the ramp heading west and will wait outside the

  the signal from the main group that the door is secure.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The last door 
  is opened by taking the ramp from the southern section of the entrance room

  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the runner 
  gets confirmation that the last door is secure, rejoin the team. Run to the

  same path the main group did.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: As the 
  runner passes through each door, that team will follow. There should be no 
  fighting prior to any door! Fighting should only occur on the lee side of each

  <b>THE <span lang="en-us">YOUNG QUEEN</span></b><br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">Once the team is reunited, take a few minutes to regroup 
  and issue any instructions if necessary. If buff timers are low, rebuff. This 
  is the rehearsal run and a chance to correct any problems.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the quest 
  leader is satisfied that everyone is prepared, head down to the shelf on the 
  SE corner of the room. Stop here. Have the mages vuln the Olthoi below, but 
  avoid the Queen. This is the young queen, a decoy, if you will. When it is 
  determined that everything is vulned, then the party may jump into the pit and 
  kill everything, BUT NOT THE QUEEN.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">When everything 
  is dead, move to the SW corner of the room, avoiding the queen and to be near 
  the exit portal.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">The quest 
  leader now gives the command for the mages and archers to kill the young queen 
  while the rest of the team watches.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">As soon as the team sees the announcement that the young 
  queen is dead, they rush to exit through the portal. The actual Queen will 
  spawn immediately, and to stay is needlessly dangerous (and will probably 
  delay the quest).</span><br>
  <br>
  <b>BACK AT THE    ROYAL HIVE</b><br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">R</span>epeat everything you did before <span lang="en-us">
  on your </span>“Rehearsal Run” through the 
  Royal Hive<span lang="en-us"> until</span> Team is reunited on the down ramp 
  just after <span lang="en-us">the last door (Door 4 on the map)</span>.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span lang="en-us">ASSAULT ON</span> THE QUEEN</b><br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">Again, check buffs. If there is less than 15 minutes, 
  rebuff. The leader instructs those with Healer's Hearts to equip them and test 
  heal the Designated Queen Slayer. Their instructions will be as follows:
  </span>When the meleer jumps into the death pit, you Healers will ID that person 
  only. You will begin healing and not stop. Do NOT chat. Do NOT use a heal 
  spell, use only the heart to heal the meleer in the pit.”<span lang="en-us"> 
  Next the leader will designate the Queen's mage. That player must be able to 
  overcome the Queen's magic defense of 406. If there are other mages on the 
  quest team, one will be chosen to vuln the Olthoi who respawn on the shelf 
  floor. Guards are also chosen to protect the healers and the Queen's Mage on 
  the shelf floor.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">There are four 
  different methods to killing the queen, but only methods 1 &amp; 2 are 
  recommended. </span>Let’s face it<span lang="en-us">;</span> 
  the “free for all” methods frequently don’t work and extend the quest. The 
  object of the quest is to kill the Queen and not to search for new death 
  items. Most people want to recover their corpses.<span lang="en-us"> The four 
  methods follow:<br>
  </span><br>
  1. Method for missile chars and mages<br>
  2. Method for meleers<br>
  3. Free for all <br>
  4. Free for all with a designated killer.<br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">1. Method for Missile Characters &amp; Mages</span><br>
  <br>
  These <span lang="en-us">players</span> will not engage the Queen directly. They will stay above her, on 
  the shelf, and shoot down at her. Therefore, you will need a meleer to hold 
  the Queen in view of those on the shelf who will kill her. The qualifications 
  for the meleer <span lang="en-us">are</span> simple: high melee defense and 
  trust. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Get everyone up 
  along the edge of the shelf. The Queen's Mage should be placed in the middle 
  with the healers on either side closer to the walls. The Guard should </span>stand just behind them<span lang="en-us">. 
  I</span>f there is another mage then <span lang="en-us">that person</span> 
  should be standing back to back to the Queen’s Mage. The 
  Jumper should position <span lang="en-us">himself </span>so that he can jump backwards directly into the 
  southeast corner WHEN <span lang="en-us">the call to jump has been given. U</span>ntil that time, 
  everyone waits.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">The Queen's 
  Mage will ID the Queen and begin Vulning her. The common set of debuffs for 
  all types of Queen Slayers includes Magic Yield, Focus, Willpower, Strength, 
  Quickness, Coordination, and Decrepitude's Grasp. If the kill takes a long 
  time, be sure to renew those debuffs on a timely basis. If the Designated 
  Slayer is a Missile character, add Gossamer Flesh, Broadside of a Barn and 
  Archer's Gift. For a Mage, use Archer's Gift or Tusker's Gift. Pierce is 
  recommended, although many prefer Bludgeon.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">As the Queen's Mage is debuffing, the healers should begin 
  using their Healer's Heart on the jumper. (T</span>here is a known bug where 
  changing the magic item will cause the Healer’s Heart to cast whatever the 
  previous magic item could cast. There have been a few Jumpers that died 
  brilliant deaths, being “brilled” by a healer’s heart because the Healer had a 
  Focusing stone in hand before!<span lang="en-us">) To use the Healer's Heart 
  correctly, Place it in a preferred hot key slot and equip it, enter into 
  combat mode, identify the heart icon on the far left side of the tab and click 
  on it, open the fellowship panel, locate the name of the jumper and click on 
  it. Now you're ready to heal using the button below the spell tab that reads: 
  USE the Healer's Heart on [character name]. Find a comfortable rhythm and 
  heal. Don't stop until the global announced the Queen's death. Trust the 
  guards to protect you, as you are trusted by the jumper.</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the 
  Queen's Mage is finished debuffing the Queen, then the mage should give the 
  command to the jumper to jump! The jumper should jump backwards into the SW 
  corner of the pit. Do NOT jump in attack mode. Do NOT ID anything. Simply wait 
  for the queen to come to you. When she does, you may ID her and call out her 
  health percentage. If you want to engage your melee defense mode, go into 
  combat mode, but DO NOT attack the queen.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> It is absolutely mandatory that you 
  stay stationary in the corner so you cannot fight<span lang="en-us">,</span> or you will be dragged away 
  and killed. A good trick: tink a no-wield UA weapon with brass, and enter 
  attack mode. This ensures that you will evade at least the guards and 
  eviscerators.<br>
  <br>
  <span lang="en-us">2. Method for Meleers</span><br>

  This method is <span lang="en-us">similar to the </span>one above, with the 
  exception <span lang="en-us">that it's </span>the melee<span lang="en-us">

  When the Queen’s Mage is finished debuffing the Queen<span lang="en-us">, they 
  will</span> give the “jump” command to the Jumper. </font><span lang="en-us">

  reach and you will die. Call out her health percentage.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the queen 
  is at 50% health, the Queen's mage and the Archers may begin shooting down at 
  the Queen. When the global announces that the Queen has been killed, the 
  healers stop healing and the entire team jumps down into the pit to kill the 
  remaining Olthoi. The new Queen Slayer will stop fighting and will immediately 
  open the Queen and loot her, making sure to take the head first. The head and 
  eggs dissolve upon decay so loot fast. After the slayer grabs the head, 
  everyone will loot the Queen in turn. The Queen drops the Queen's Head, 4 
  Olthoi Carapaces, 5 Olthoi Eggs, and various other items. Once you've looted 
  all the kills, portal or recall out.</font></span></p>

  Method</span><br>
  <br>
  Run and jump into the pit and run around trying not to die 
  and to kill the Queen. A bit of advice here: make sure you have a Recall Gem 
  to anywhere. The Queen can take you out in one blow if she hits you in the 
  back. Remember, you will be attacked by the rest of the monsters. Of course, 
  as in any all out battle, there will be an incredible amount of lag. 
  Occasionally this method works<span lang="en-us">;</span> I saw it once. The killer was all sorry 
  because the designated killer missed his quest.<br>
  <span lang="en-us"><br>
  3. Free For All Method with Designated Slayer</span></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have only one thing to say about 
  the odds on this one with everyone getting out alive: ROFLMAO! However, I 
  understand that there is a sweet spot nestled in the egg nest where a 
  designated killer may be able to stand and kill the Queen while avoiding being 
  hit by her. I don’t know exactly where this sweet spot is, but I can point out 
  exactly where it is not (using the corpses I have recovered for folks not 
  quite ON “the sweet spot”)<br>
