        <p><font face="Arial" class="BaseMsgFont"><b><small>The Emissaries</small></b><small><b><br>
      </b>During explorations in Direlands, brave adventurers stumbled upon two previously undiscovered Empyrean structures: the 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10160.html">Castle Chalicmere</a> and the 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10932.html">Tomb of the Sand Kings</a>. In both places, adventurers encountered undead Emissaries, claiming to have been sent in the name of the Mistress of Aerlinthe. For a fee they will open a portal to the island. After stepping through the portal, you will exit on Aerlinthe at 84.1N,
      47.2E (Restricted to Levels 45+).<br>
      <br>
      Garaena the Emissary can be found at the 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10932.html">Tomb of the Sand Kings</a> (87.6S, 65.6W).<br>
      <br>
      To reach Garaena, run to 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10904.html">Sylsfear Dungeon</a> (11.0N, 14.7E). Inside you will find a portal past the Shadows section. The portal drops you at a lifestone in the South Direlands (88.3S 64.5W). If you look south east you will see the set of three bunkers. Garaena is standing to the south of the bunker farthest east.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">The rotting woman inclines her head stiffly, and a disembodied voice seeps across your mind like oil. "Child, you walk among the tombs of the Sand Kings. Long ago they were mighty captains in service to the powers behind the Ice Throne. Now they rest, and dream of new plots. Yet still they hold themselves great power, and are ageless and fey."&nbsp;<br>
      "My mistress sent me hither to solicit their aid in a great cause. Perhaps you could serve, for I shall call the enemy of mine enemy friend. Those in shadow...thralls of the one called Slayer of Hope...beset our isle. If you give me a note worth 50,000 of the Yalaini pyreal, to fund my mission to bribe the Sand Kings, I shall open the gate for you.&nbsp;<br>
      "Be warned; only the mightiest may pass through this gate, and I will not allow you to tie to it."&nbsp;<br>
      </font><br>
      When you give Garaena the pyreal (a D note), she summons a portal to the Island of Aerlinthe and whispers to you yet again:&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">The voice in your mind purrs, "Ai, this will serve. Seek the dark ones and destroy them...yet meddle not with the devices on the island of Aerlinthe. Perilous they are to those who do not understand their art."&nbsp;<br>
      </font><br>
      Faladha the Emissary apears at Chalicmere Castle (17.0S, 57.5W).<br>
      <br>
      The best way to reach 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10160.html">Castle Chalicmere</a> is as follows: Go to Baishi and buy some Sake from the Grocer. From Baishi, run south to the 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10239.html">Drunken Madman's Tower</a> (53.0S, 61.0E). Hand the Drunken Madman the Sake and he will summon a portal to the 
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=11037.html">Walled Portals</a> in the Direlands (24.1 S, 57.7 W). From there, take the portal to the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10030.html">Accursed Halls</a> (24 S, 57.9 W). You'll emerge inside another walled fort. Just climb the stairs and jump outside the walls. A short run north will lead you to
      <a href="../../landmark.asp-placeID=10160.html">Castle Chalicmere</a> (17.0S, 57.5W). You might want to stop by the Lifestone at 16.3S 54.6W before heading to Aerlinthe.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To enter the Castle you will need either a Jump skill of 250+ (to jump over the wall) or Lockpick. Be careful as the fortress is surrounded by 
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20256.html">Diamond Golems</a>, 
      <a href="../../class.asp-classID=1054.html">Tuskers</a> and other fearsome creatures. Inside you'll encounter some
      <a href="../../class.asp-classID=1055.html">Undead</a> and
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20241.html">Obsidian Golems</a>, but if you're quick, you can avoid fighting most of these creatures. Once inside, you'll see Faladha the Emissary.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">The dead man turns and looks down the rotted remains of his nose at you. A cool, Aristocatic presence invades your mind, and seems to speak in Roulean. "You are foolish to come here, outlander. This is the castle called Chalicmere, fortress of the Latzimestal faction..."&nbsp;<br>
      "Ah, but such subteties are beyond you. To your barbarian eye, we are merely corpses and bones, all alike and monstrous. Yet it is not so, and these rotting forms you revile shaped the destinies of men and kingdoms far beyond your ken."&nbsp;<br>
      "Obstruct me not, whelp. I have urgent traffic with the Lords of the Latzimestal..., Unless you will give me a note worth 10,000 pyreal. Then I shale grant you all the adventure you desire, if you be mighty enough to use my passage. Yet I shale not suffer barbarians in my home, and will prevent you from conjuring the gate yourself."&nbsp;</font><br>
      <br>
      When you hand the Emissary the required fee (a C note), he also summons a portal to the Island of Aerlinthe.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">"The voice in your mind sneers, "You are wise to offer me such a boon, lest I strike ye down like the cur in the street. I shale open the path to my home, the ancient port of Aerlinthe. You would be wise to tread lightly, lest you wake the ire of my island my Lady."&nbsp;</font><br>

      <span lang="en-us">Undead</span> Town</a> at 86.4N, 45.6E. (See the
      <a href="AerlintheMap.htm"> Aerlinthe Map</a> for more details.) The Town is all that remains of the original Yalaini settlement -- a small arrangements of temples grouped around a sacrificial altar. Charred corpses contorted in various positions litter the area. One temple, a former library, contains the Charred Book that translates into the
      <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Aerlinthe.htm"> Aerlinthe Record</a>. To find it, look for a temple with a standing stone in front. As you explore, you will hear strange whisperings in your mind.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">Smith Ejan says, "Hanaurel..."&nbsp;<br>
      In your mind the dusty voice of Ejan whispers, "Written thoughts - letter..."&nbsp;<br>

      Smith Ejan says, "Zorn... zorn..."&nbsp;<br>
      In your mind, the dusty voice of Ejan whispers, "All gone, all gone..."&nbsp;<br>
      Smith Ejan says, "Suvani hasode, Metresa, tamaa Der Hallae."&nbsp;<br>

      <br>
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20703.html">Smith Ejan</a> was the second governor of Aerlinthe and also a Master Smith. Now, he is one of the Undead, a level 165 Skeleton. When you defeat Smith Ejan, you will discover a Singed Note on his corpse that can be translated in Cragstone into the
      <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Smith.htm"> Smith's Note</a>. This note, which mentions the need for both a pair of Bellows and a bar to repair one of the magma sluices, will start you on the quest.</font></p>

      <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Pyreal Forge Bellows<br>
      </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">The Smith's Note, dropped from the 
      corpse of the Undead
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20703.html">Smith Ejan</a>, mentioned the following clue for continuing the Aerlinth quest: "Specifically, I need a new set of bellows for the upper forging mechanism, up here in the caldera of Tenkarrdun." Coincidentally, several explorers while fighting in the deepest recesses of the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10189.html">Crater Caves dungeon</a> (66.7N, 12.5E) had previously stumbled upon a set of Pyreal Forge Bellows, lying between some forges.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The Bellows were brought to Aerlinthe and taken to the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10909.html">Tenkarrdun Foundry</a> (88.9N, 42.7E, restricted to Levels 24+). To get to the forges you need to reach the area below the storeroom level. It's tricky! The door is opened by a lever on Level 3 in the elevated dome room. You'll need to assign someone in your team to wait by the lever and hit it when you are all at the door ready to enter. Once you work your way down to the forge, you'll see the walls are lined with more of the oven/forge structures found in the bottom of 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10189.html">Crater Caves</a> and in the Storeroom of the Foundry.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      At the very back of the room you'll find the 
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20237.html">Smithing Golem</a>. As you hand him the Pyreal Forge Bellows a server wide message is broadcast:&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#66FF99">The ground trembles beneath you! Mount Tenkarrdum has become active once again! On Dereth, the volcanoes echo the eruption on far Aerlinthe Island.&nbsp;<br>
      </font>
      <br>
      After this message is broadcast, the Golem crumbles to the ground then disappears, and the forge begins to fill up with lava.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <hr width="60%">
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Sluice Gate Bar<br>
      </b>While you're at the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10909.html">Tenkarrdun Foundry</a> delivering the Pyreal Forge Bellows, you will also want to look for the Sluice Gate Bar.  The
      <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Aerlinthe.htm"> Aerlinthe Record</a> had mentioned serious problems at the forge, with massive collapses of tunnels during a landquake. The entire lower portion of the foundry became cut off. These landquakes also caused magma flows into the upper tunnels. In the Smith's Note Ejan mentions a bar on one of the lower magma sluices which needs repair (sluice: n. an artificial waterway with agate or other device to control the flow and level of the water). Luckily he has some of these bars, stashed away in his storerooms.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The Sluice Gate Bar is found in a lower section of the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10909.html">Tenkarrdun Foundry</a> (88.9N, 42.7E). The bar is in the forge room on Level 4. Use the maps
      to the right for details.<br>
      <br>
 In order to repair the magma sluices, you'll need to deliver the Bar to the 
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20236.html">Repair Golem</a>, deep in the bowels of the
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10045.html">Aerlinthe Reservoir Dungeon</a> (85.<span lang="en-us">3</span>N, 43.<span lang="en-us">5</span>E - restricted to Levels 45+).&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The dungeon is split into 2 parts. The 
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20236.html">Repair Golem</a> is located in the Old Ring section. Use the Upper Reservoir Map to reach the Olthoi Section, then use the Olthoi Map to reach the Old Ring in the 
      <a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=10046.html">Lower Section</a>. You'll see a second Aerlinthe Reservoir Portal in a pit on the 5th floor of the Olthoi section. It drops you directly into the Old Ring section.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Using the Lower Map, you should be able to make your way to the jump in the west end of the ring section. You need to be careful that you jump at an angle, allowing you to land on the safety gate. Otherwise, you will fall deep into the magma pit and either die from the heat damage or be mauled by the Golems below. After you successfully make the jump, you will see the 
      <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20236.html">Repair Golem</a>. Hand it the Sluice Gate Bar and the following message is broadcast to the surrounding area.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#66FF99">The golem turns and fuses the bar into the Sluice Gate. Somewhere below, you hear a grinding vibration through the ground... The fires of Tenkarrdun have been redirected the the ancient Yalaini Forges.&nbsp;<br>
      </font>
      <br>
      After this message is broadcast, the Golem will crumble to the ground and disappear.&nbsp;<br>
