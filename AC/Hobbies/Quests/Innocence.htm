to your human foes, the dungeon is also full of Vulnerability traps and War VII 
traps. Hugging the walls will not help you here. The best tactic is to go

immediately! After healing to full health, then you can move forward again.

<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">Once your 
party is buffed, pick the lock on the door (dir 402). Remember: go slowly!! Just 
on the other side of the door, the Key to Jaleh's Chest spawns on the ground. At 
this point in the quest, several in your party will be dead. Because they just 
didn't listen!! Goooo slooooww. Heal, then move.</font></span></p>

the room then continue straight through, heading south (you will have to pick 
another locked door). When you hit the T, take a left and go up the ramp. Stay 
left and keep going up until you open into a large room. There will be a 
structure in the center of the room. Take the passage through the structure opening 
to the north and head down the ramp. At the bottom, take a right at the split, 
then take the next ramp on your left, heading down to the south.</font></span></p>

the corner to the right, you can also find Jaleh's Shirt. Wait until everyone 
picks up both items before continuing.</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="-1">From the pot area head east 
again. This corridor is safe for buffing, if necessary. Go through the next

Though he was gruff at times and often selfish there was a part of him that was 
truly and deeply generous and kind.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;I knew that part of his life and now that has been taken. 
Where is the law in this land that will punish his murderer?&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;Would that there was someone that could bring this criminal 
to justice. Alas, I must be thankful that you have found this ring, the symbol 
of our love.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;You have done more then ever I would have expected any to 
achieve. Thank you for setting my mind at ease. It is horrible what has happened 
but never knowing what had happened to Jaleh, my love, would have been far 
worse.&quot;</font><br>

You give Aaminah Jaleh's Slippers.</font><font color="#00FF99"><br>

potent magic.&quot;<br>

know that my husband is no longer among the living. For him to part ways with 
this finery ensures that his life is over.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;How I wish that you had not found this item. But you have.&quot;<br>

taken it off around me. Even when he slept. It was the only thing that he had to 
remind himself of home. Here.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;I have no need of it anymore. But you might find the same

it.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;Jaleh was more than impressed, he was astounded but true to 
form he berated the apprentice and had the cost of the shirt lowered.I felt bad 
for the apprentice but there was little that I could do.&quot;<br>
Aaminah tells you, &quot;Do me one final favor, please.Take this note to the 
apprentice so that they might know the truth.&quot;</font><br>

the Innocent), can be swapped out between Isparian Weapons, and you can use the 
Isparian Weapons Modifying Tool to exchange it in and out. Finally we can 
reconfigure our Isparians without having to do the stone quests over and over!<br>
<br>
The Heart only works on perfect weapons, when I attempted to stone a Superb to 
see if the properties were different, the weapon would not take the stone.<br>

Orion on Weeping Weapons changes</a>:</font></span><p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">As stated before on other boards, 
we have been looking at the effect that the new Weeping Weapons have had on PvP. 
We've been testing them today, and also reading the feedback that has been 
posted on the various boards. <br>
<br>
While the weapons appeared well-balanced in controlled situations, we have 
determined that four of the weapons tip the scales too far in one direction: the 
wand, bow, crossbow and atlatl. <br>
<br>
As a result, the following changes will be made to the weapons at the beginning 
of the July Patch: <br>
<br>
Bow: The bow will have it's damage bonus modifier reduced to a more survivable 
level of 80%. <br>
<br>
Crossbow and Atlatl: These weapons will have their damage bonus reduced to 100%.
<br>
<br>
Wand: The wand will see a reduction in the maximum slayer bonus that it is 
afforded. The new value will eliminate the chance for mages to single shot a 
prepared and seasoned PvP player. <br>
<br>
When the new weapons are released please post any additional feedback you have 
on this thread. <br>
<br>
