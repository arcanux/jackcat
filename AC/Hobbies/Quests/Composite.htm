    <td valign="top" width="248"><small><font face="Arial">Affectionately nicknamed
    &quot;Frankenstein's Bow&quot;, the Composite Bow/Crossbow revives the ancient Isparian
    art of bow crafting. Composed of horn, cured sinew, and animal gut, these weapons have the
    potential to rival even the 112-113% yumis, until now the most powerful bows in the game.
    Like the Atlan Weapons and the Shadow Armor, this quest has already fostered a sub-economy
    within Dereth, as Archers everywhere finally make meaningful trades for their formerly
    worthless motes! </font></small><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Overview</small></strong><br>
    <small>The Composite Bow/Crossbow quest can be completed by players of varying levels. The
    damage modifiers and different properties of the bows vary substantially, depending on
    which components you use to craft your weapon and how high your skill level is at
    different points during the construction. To add an Attack Bonus plus some additional
    spells, you can attach a handle to your weapon by carving an Undead Thighbone after
    stringing the bow.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The Crossbow version of this quest requires an additional step in its construction,
    called the Stock, made from a Wood Golem Heart.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Lower Level Components:</small></strong><br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Skill Requirements</small></strong><br>
    <small>All three trade skills are used for this quest. Cooking is required to Cure your
    Sinews. Alchemy (not fletching as you might think) is required to oil your string.
    Fletching is required to carve the handle. In addition, a skill check takes place when you
    string your bow. Making the highest level (X)Bows is difficult indeed, requiring the skill
    of an extremely accomplished archer. The (X)Bow becomes no-drop after you have attached
    the sting. It's possible to hire out the cooking, alchemy and fletching, but you must
    string the bow yourself. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The Book</small></strong><br>
    <small>The quest begins in Ayan Baqur (59.9S x 87.9W). Look for Yuan Hanzu the
    Bowyer </small><small>(<font face="Arial" size="2">60.1S, 87.9W)</font></small><small>.
    He'll tell you about a book he wrote which he distributed to the local Ivory Crafters.
    This book, which can be obtained by giving the Ivory Crafter a Fire Auroch Horn, details
    the steps involved in crafting these fine weapons. You can read it <a href="../../Culture/Texts/YuanHanzu.htm">here</a>.</small><br>
    <br>
    <strong><small>The Stock</small></strong><br>
    <small>The Stock is used for the Crossbow only. Follow the instructions of Yuan Hanzu and
    find Barnar the Tinker in Stonehold 68.8N, 21.5W. If you bring him a Wood Golem Heart,
    he'll craft it into the Stock for you. </small></font>
      </p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The Sinews</small></strong><br>
    <small>Sinews come in two varieties: large and small. The Large Lugian Sinews are trophies
    on Gigas, Extas and Taitus Lugians. The Small Lugian Sinews are found on Amploth, Obeloth
    and Lithos Lugians. The sinews are used in the construction of the arms of the (X)Bows.
    They are first cured, then stretched over the horns to aid in resistance.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To cure the sinews, you'll need to cook them in
    a Cooking Pot. You can produce three different varieties of Cured Sinews, depending on
    your cooking skill and whether you used a Large or a Small Sinew. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial"><strong>1. Cured Small Lugian Sinew</strong><br>
    <em>Made from the failed cooking of a Small Lugian Sinew.</em></font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>2. Cured Lugian Sinew<br>
    </strong><em>Made from expertly cooking a Small Lugian Sinew, or from the failed cooking
    of a Large Lugian Sinew.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>3. Cured Large Lugian Sinew</strong><br>
    <em>Made from expertly cooking a Large Lugian Sinew.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To succeed in expertly cooking your sinews, you
    should have at least a cooking skill of 250. Even then, you'll have about a 50% chance of
    failure. It's also possible to succeed at a much lower skill level, but you'll probably
    need to have a few extra sinews on hand. As your skill level increases, your chances of
    expertly cooking your sinews increases also. A skill level over 300 appears to be the best
    bet for expertly cooking the sinews most of the time.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The properties given by the Sinews are still
    unconfirmed, although they do appear to determine the speed. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The Arms</small></strong><br>
    <small>To make the Arms, in addition to your sinews, you'll need two horns of the same
    type. Your two choices are two Great Mattekar Horns or two Fire Auroch Horns (<em>must</em>
    be from BULLS). Both arms need to be constructed from the same material to have a balanced
    weapon.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Carving the Horns</small></strong><br>
    <small>When you have your two horns, you'll need to bring them to Yuan Hanzu in Ayan Baqur
    to have them carved.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Composite Arms</small></strong><br>
    <small>The Shaped horn needs to be combined with the Cured Sinew to make the completed
    arm. Use the Sinew on the Horn to get a Composite Arm. Horns determine the Melee Defense
    with Mattekar Horns yielding +6% and Auroch Horns yielding +2%. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The Stave</small></strong><br>
    <small>Making the Stave is easy and straightforward. Simply combine your two arms to get
    your Composite Stave. This is what you'll use to string your bow. There's no skill check
    required at this step. The Stave can still be dropped or given away.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">If you're making the Crossbow, combine your
    Stave with your Crossbow Stock to get a Crossbow Stock with Stave. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The String</small></strong><br>
    <small>Ah, the string! This is the point that will make or break many an archer! Like the
    Lugian Sinews, the string can be made from two different creature trophies, and there are
    three possible outcomes to the Alchemical process. &nbsp;You'll need three Sclavus Tongues
    or three Drudge Ravener Guts. When you combine the first two, they become twisted
    together. Combine the third for either Braided Sclavus Tongues or Braided Drudge Ravener
    Guts. This is what you apply the Bloodseeker Oil to for your string. The string determines
    the damage modifier for the bow. The best string is made by a successful oiling of the
    Ravener Guts.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The Alchemical Skill for applying oil to the
    string is similar to the Cooking skill required for the Sinews. A minimum of 250 is
    suggested, although something over 270 is recommended. If you can find someone with a
    skill of 300 or more, you greatly reduce your chance of failing. If you succeed in
    applying the oil to the string you will get this message, &quot;You apply oil liberally to
    the string.&quot; If you fail, you will simply get the message, &quot;You apply oil to the
    string.&quot; The three outcomes of this process are as follows:</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>1. Oiled String</small></strong><br>
    <small><em>Made from the failed oiling of Braided Sclavus Tongues.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>2. Fine Oiled String</small></strong><br>
    <small><em>Made from applying oil liberally to Braided Sclavus Tongues or from the failed
    oiling of Braided Drudge Ravener Guts.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>3. Excellent Oiled String</small></strong><br>
    <small><em>Made from applying oil liberally to Braided Drudge Ravener Guts.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>Stringing the Bow</small></strong><br>
    <small>Now for the tricky part. It's time to string the bow. This is a step you <em>must</em>
    take yourself. After the string is on, your bow becomes no-drop. If you can't get your Bow
    or Crossbow skill up to at least 280, you might consider using the Oilied String or Fine
    Oiled String instead of the Excellent and making a lesser quality bow until your level
    improves. You don't need as high a bow skill to successfully attach an Oiled String or a
    Fine Oiled String. (Some players, however, are still reporting failures in
    the low 200s with the lesser strings.) Remember that even the lesser bows still make excellent weapons!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If you want to know how hard it is to string the bow using the Excellent Oiled
    String, just take a look around the boards and read message after message of people
    snapping their strings. (If you fail to string the bow, you will destroy your string.) It
    is possible to have success with the Excellent Oiled String with a skill stat in the low
    200s, but it's not likely. This is a skill level more suited to one of the lesser bows. A
    skill of 250 seems to yield a 50% rate of success for the Excellent Oiled String. Again,
    your best chance for success for the highest level bow is to string it with a skill over
    300. 350 is even better! If you succeed, you will receive this message, &quot;You deftly
    attach the string to the stave.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>The Handle</small></strong><br>
    <small>As Yuan Hanzu says, it's not necessary to attach a handle to use a bow. Although
    with the nice Attack Bonus and spells it adds, most people will probably want one. By now,
    you've probably guessed that there are three possible handles to attach, made from two
    different trophies. You can use an Undead Thighboen from one of several Undead Creatures:
    a Lich, Lich Lord, Revenant, Skeleton Bone Lord or Great Skeleton. Or you can use the
    Undead Thighbone from a Dark Revenant for the better handle. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To carve the handle you'll need a Fletcher and a
    Whittling Knife. The skill of the Fletcher will determine the quality of the handle, so
    get your skill as high as possible, once again. A minimum of 250 is suggested, but a skill
    of at least 280 is recommended. The intricately carved handle from the high undead is
    extremely difficult to make. Fletchers with skills solidly in the 300s are still only
    carving with an 80% success rate. The three outcomes of this process are as follows:</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><strong><font face="Arial">1. Bone Handle (carved from the bone of
    the undead)</font></strong></small><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small><em>Made from carving an Undead Thighbone.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial"><small>2. Bone Handle (intricately carved from
    the bone of the undead)</small></font></strong><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small><em>Made from intricately carving an Undead Thighbone or failing
    to intricately carve a Dark Revenant Undead Thighbone.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial"><small>3. Bone Handle (intricately carved from
    the bone of the high undead)</small></font></strong><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small><em>Made from intricately carving a Dark Revenant Undead
    Thighbone.</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Next, mount your handle on your Bow or Crossbow.
    You'll get the following message as you complete this final step: &quot;You deftly attach
    the handle to the crossbow.&quot; The handle determines the Attack bonus for the bow and
    adds Blood Seeker and (X)Bow Mastery Other to the weapon. </font></small></td>

    <br>
    <small>Wood Golems can </font><font face="Times New Roman">usually be found around
    Stonehold and are plentiful in the woods to the North.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>The Livnak range outside of Qalaba'r is always a favorite Lugian hunting area. The
    newly discovered Lugian Citadels</small><br>
    <small><font class="NewsFont">56.5S x&nbsp; 67E</font> </small><br>
    <small><font class="NewsFont">70.2S x 24.3E</font> </small><br>
    <small>67.9S x 62.6E</small><br>
    <small>with their fast spawn rates and dense population have also proved popular for this
    quest. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><small>Some good hunting areas for the Mattekars are
    around the Livnak Range near Qalaba'r along the mountains near Mayoi, up north in the
    colder areas by the Crater, and of course, the Mattekar Caves (<font class="NewsFont">65.4N
    x 16.7E</font>).&nbsp; </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Fire Aurochs can often be found in the woods outside of Stonehold and
    approx. 26N, 51W..</small></font><font class="BaseMsgFont" face="Times New Roman"><br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Times New Roman"><small>A good place for Scalvus hunting is the Empyrean
    Foundry (25.2S x 54.2E), located outside the Blackmire Swamps near Sawato. The new Sclavus
    Cathedral is rumored to be not too far away (25.9S x 46.5E). Another good location is
    Sclavus Keep (38.9S, 48.4W), but if you do your hunting there, be careful of the traps on
    the upper level.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Drudge Raveners are plentiful in the&nbsp; Dungeon of Corpses (56.1S x 49.6W). They
    are also quite easily found throughout the Direlands.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><small>Dark Revenants can be found in the Serac Vault <font class="NewsFont">(75.9S x 29E</font><small>)</small>, and deep in Sylsfear Dungeon <font class="NewsFont">(11N x 14.7E</font><small>).</small></small></font></td>
