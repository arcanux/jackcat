		Hi Maggie,<br>
	<br>
	Just finished Dark Caverns Quest. Need large group. Gem to dungeon is found 
	on Ravens around Caul. Dungeon is split into 2 two parts. Groups split at 
	start and take the 2 opposing paths. Fairly straight forward. One side is 
	full of Virindi's and Shadows, the other is full of Raven Conscripts. 
	Pillars abound and will hurt you bad. At end of each side is a door, 
	operated from a lever by the other group in thier door room. Pull levers and 
	meet up. Follow around and kill a door and follow path to room with boss. 
	70k in hp's I think, but he goes down to frost and or slash. We did not try 
	anything else. In center of final room is a platform that has the Monolith 
	and token is from boss's corpse. Monolith spells cast +3 to focus, quick, 
	coord and endurance and lasts for 2 hours.<br>

	<p>
	<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Pics from the new quest 
	from the gem that the ravens drop. Dark Monolith Cavers.is the name of the 
	quest. Pretty straight forward quest. Gotta split up into two groups at the 
	beginning with the right side being V and shadows, an the left being raven 
	hands. The two groups end up joining up at the end so no worries with the 
	boss. The end boss is a huge fire elemental where slashing and bldg worked 
	out well on him (cold not so well desipte what you woudl think).<br>
	<br>
	Kill him and your fellow gets flagged to use the monolith in the center 
	platform. The loot on him is a title token. If you take the dark monolith 
	shard to ulgrim he will give you 5 million exp. Or you can hook it on a 
	house hook and it is a usable item. It casts 4 spells that last 2 hours each 
	and increase your quick, coord, will, and end by 3 pts.<br>
	<br>
	First to complete it on VT: Rak'than Lograthsun, Minnie the Minx, Ares 
	Blackheart, Some Mage, Powerlite, Compulation, Eagleheart, Morgwyn, Skekis, 
	Talonblade.</font></span></p>

	<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Hi Maggie, I just wanted 
	to submit a new quest from his patch.<br>
	<br>
	Its for the Dark Monolith<br>
	<br>
	You start by looking for a Dark Monolith Caverns gem. The Raven creatures at 
	caul drop them.<br>
	<br>
	Afterwards you use them, I'd make sure you have a decent sized fellow there 
	are allot of high level virindi and shadows inside. As well as a few 
	Crystals.<br>
	<br>
	When you come in at the drop the fellow will need to split up into 2 groups, 
	each taking a different hall, I'd suggest killing as you go, otherwise you 
	will get trapped by the critters following you. Each fellow will follow 
	their halls till you come to a door that can only be opened with a lever. 
	The leaver at each opposite door opens the other door. Afterwards follow the 
	hall and the 2 groups will meet up, afterwards it doesn't matter which hall 
	you follow as both come out at the same place. You will come out at a large 
	room filled with magma it will have small magma golems and a Guardian of the 
	Dark monolith, I'd suggest focusing on him, when he dies the smaller golems 
	die also.<br>
	<br>
	Once you've cleared the room there is a Dark Monolith in the center of the 
	room. Everyone needs to double click on it, it will give you a Dark monolith 
	that needs to be hooked to use.<br>
	<br>
	It casts Dark Persistence: +3 Endurance<br>
	Dark Reflex +3 Focus<br>
	Dark Equilibrium +3 Coord<br>
	Dark Purpose +3 Quick<br>
	<br>
	Those that did the quest and need to be included are Fallen God, Ralph II, 
	Brutal-Force jr, Jarbo, Kool-aide, Anarkist, Uck Me, Orahn, Pink-i, Redstar, 
	Dread', and Cps All of the Fallen God monarchy on Darktide<br>
	<br>
	Thank you<br>
	Fallen God<br>
