    <td valign="top" width="248" height="1453"><font class="basefont" face="Arial" size="2">It's
      all about Uziz! Who's in Uziz? (I just like saying Uziz!) Gersan
      the Sureshot, Gervena the Oblique, and Gerloc the Defender. They've set up
      shop to transform your crystal gems from the Vestibule dungeons into
      powerful Orbs, Shields or (X)Bows!&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin the
      Shendolain Vestibule quest,
      you'll need a Shedolain Key from a Harrower or Destroyer Grievver. Everyone going will
      need their own key. Or take two! They're small.</font></p>
      <p><font class="basefont" face="Arial" size="2">The best way to get to the
      dungeon at 53.8S, 59.6W is to have a member of your party tie to the
      entrance and give you a ride. If that's not an option, you can run from
      either the Tumedion Fortress (55.9S, 60.7W) or the Black Spawn Den (60.0S,
      57.7W). There's a lifestone relatively close by at 49.9S, 53.7W. The dungeon
      itself is
      restricted to Levels 36+.</font></p>
      <p><font class="basefont" face="Arial" size="2">There are two parts to the
      quest. The first part consists of using your key on the gate to get your
      Shendolain Portal Gem, and the second part consists of killing the
      Shendolain Crystal for your gem. You may even want to consider doing the
      quest on two different nights. If you're going with a large group, the
      final wait for everyone to get their gem can be brutal and can turn the
      quest into a 4-5 hour marathon and you'll find yourself still up at 3AM
      and you'll be completely worthless the next day! Hee hee. Longest durn
      quest I ever did!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font class="basefont" face="Arial" size="2">It's much better inside,
      than outside! When you first enter the
      dungeon, you'll be in a room that is safe to organize and buff.&nbsp; You'll need
      to split your party into two group. Teamwork is required. One group will
      be the Lever Team to open the doors for the rest of the party; the other
      group, the Gate Team, will be working their way down through the dungeon
      to the Shendolain Gate. The Lever Team doesn't have to be large -- just
      enough to kill a few Skeleton Bone Knights, two Dark Revenants and the
      occasional Great Skeleton. A mage who can Imperil and a few melees (use
      fire) should do the trick. You should also have one person from each Team
      tie to the entrance portal so you can more easily reorganize at the top
      when the first group is done. Then make a new Lever Team and do it again
      so that everyone has a chance to get a Shendolain Portal Gem for the 2nd
      half.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Lever Team</b><br>
      When you're ready, take the right passage from the entrance heading West and go down
      the ramp and across the bridge. To avoid the lag spike, lower your
      graphics settings. Fight the Great Skeleton and Bone Knight at bottom of
      the ramp. Keep to the right and head up. At the split take the right passage and the lever room is up
      the ramp in a room to the right. You'll see four groups of 4 levers levers
      each. Leave your Lever Team here. Have one person in the Gate Group
      Fellowship with the Lever Team in order to coordinate opening the doors.
      The Lever team won't be doing much more than killing the spawn while they
      wait for the signal from the Gate team, watching for the occasional pea
      drop!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Door 1</b><br>
      The Gate Team will want to follow the same directions from the
      entrance, except they will take the left at the split, instead of the
      right passage which leads to the lever room. At the next 3 way split go straight then
      take a right over the bridge. Head down a ramp and at the T at the bottom
      kill the Diamond Golem and the Great Skeletons. The first door is directly
      to your left. Wait here for the Lever Team to open it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each group of four levers opens one of the
      doors below. The first door is opened by one of the levers in the group of
      four closest to the door (to your right if you are standing in the doorway).
      Pull the levers slowly, one at a time, until the lower group gives the
      signal that you have opened the door.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Note: </b>there are several theories about how the levers work. 1) You
      need to pull the levers 4-3-2-1 right to left to open the door. 2) You
      need to pull the levers 4-3-2 but don't hit 1 or the door with close after
      it opens. 3) It's a random lever of the group of 4 that resets with each
      quest. Best bet is to pull them right to left, slowly one at a time, until
      the Gate Team signals it's open.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Door 2</b><br>
      From there, the Gate Team will take the ramp down and kill the&nbsp; 3 Cursed
      Bones &amp; Revenants. At the first split make a left heading North. At
      the T take a right heading E. You'll see your first large open room ahead,
      but don't go in! It's full of nasties! Keep to the left and take the North ramp heading down
      again, past the Diamond Golem above. From there, make your first right heading South,
      then head down another ramp. After passing a Great Skeleton and a Dark
      Revenant you'll enter a small room with a lever and two doors, one
      straight ahead and one around to the right. Be careful not to
      use the lever. The door you want is around to the right on the South Wall.
      Supposedly, both doors lead to the same location, but the right door has
      easier monster -- mostly undead, and the other has deadly golems.
      Additionally, there have been reports of problems getting the other doors
      open when taking the straight ahead route.<br>
      <br>
      This second door, like the first, must be opened from above. Give the
      signal to Lever Team and they'll use the 2nd group of levers to the left of the
      first. The door doesn't stay open long, so hurry through!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Door 3</b><br>
      The path to the 3nd door is very straightforward. Take the ramp down and
      kill the Skeleton Bone Lords &amp; Great Skeleton in the hall. Follow the
      passage until you reach the door. It's guarded by more undead. Again, the
      Lever Team above opens the door with the next group of levers, to the left
      of the previous one.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Door 4<br>
      </b>From here, the path gets even more treacherous, with Plasma &amp;
      Diamond Golems, Relic Bones and more. Cross the bridge and kill the Plasma
      Golems, then the Relic and Ashen Bones. Watch out for Plasmas dropping
      from above. Take the passage past the Dark
      Revs, Plasma Golems &amp; Relic Bones to the room with the 4th door. After
      the Lever Team opens the door (using the far left set of levers), go
      through and buff for the final room.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Shendolain Gate</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><br>
      </b>The passage to the Shendolain Gate is blocked by 2 Plasma Golems,
      Relic Bones and a Diamond Golem. When you reach the final room, you'll
      have to kill more undead (lots of Dark Revs, Skeleton Bone Lords, etc.)
      and the occasional Diamond Golem. Use your key on the Gate to get your
      Portal Gem. If you brought extra keys, you can get more than one portal
      gem -- insurance in case you need to recover a corpse in the 2nd half!
      When everyone is ready, regroup at the entrance so you can do it again!
      This time, the Lever Team will become part of the Gate Team so they can
      also get a Portal Gem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><b><small>Shendolain
      Chamber<br>
      </small></b><small>For the 2nd part of the quest, your group<b> must</b>
      have a lock-picker among you. When everyone has a Shendolain Portal Gem,
      use them at the same time and enter the Shendolain dungeon. The entrance
      is safe, so you can wait for everyone to download. You'll be in a large
      room, on a ledge overlooking a pit. After everyone is in, buff, then jump
      down into the pit (minor damage).&nbsp;</small></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" class="BaseMsgFont"><small>There are two ways to go.
      One leads to a door that must be opened with a lever; the other leads to a
      door that must be opened with lockpick to activate the lever. Take most of
      your group down the SW passage, then
      make your first right, heading North. You'll encounter your first Plasma
      Golem. Make you next right heading East, and kill another Plasma Golem.
      Make a left and then an immediate right heading East until you find the locked
      door guarded by a Diamond Golem.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      </small></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Have a few members of your
      group go the other direction. (Make sure the lock-picker is among them!)
      Find the locked door and pick it, then throw</font><font face="Arial" class="BaseMsgFont"><small>
      the lever inside to open the door to the lower part of the dungeon. After going through the door, it's pretty easy to make your way
      down past the Dual Fragments to the Shendolain Crystal, but watch out for the
      Magic Traps! They cast Mana Blight and will drain 170 points of your mana.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" class="BaseMsgFont"><small>
      The Shendolain Crystal (Level 126) is surrounded by about 4 Shendolain
      Satellite Fragments (level 53 -- like Dual Frags on a 15 minute spawn). Wear your Lightning
      Protection! An Imperil from a Mage, and a few good Archers
      or Mace fighters will bring the Crystal down without too much
      trouble.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" class="BaseMsgFont"><small><b>Shendolain Crystal Gem</b><br>
      The Shendolain Crystal Gem is found on the corpse of the Crystal. It's
      no-drop, no-give</small></font><font class="BaseMsgFont"><font face="Arial"><small>
      and is on a one week real life timer. The Crystal itself is on a 5 minute spawn,
      so it's not too bad a wait for your entire group to get a Gem. Before
      starting, make sure everyone knows how long the approximate wait will be
      in the final chamber. There's nothing more annoying than having folks grab
      their gem then recalling out, leaving the rest to fend for
      themselves.&nbsp;While you're waiting, the hall before the chamber is a
      great place to kill Dual Fragments. There are 4 of them that spawn at a 7
      minute interval.</small></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>When everyone has a Shendolain Gem, head to Uziz at <font face="Arial" size="2">24.4S,
      28.7E </font>for your prize -- an Orb, a Bow or a Shield. Double click the
      NPCs first so you make sure you turn your gem in to the correct brother.
      To make the Crossbow, you'll need to add a stock (see Barnar the Tinker in
      Stonehold) to the Bow. </small></font>
