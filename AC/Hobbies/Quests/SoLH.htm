      <font size="2" face="Arial">The quest for the Sword of Lost Hope involves
      a journey deep into the bowels of evil, where even the floors can kill
      you: the Sepulcher of the Hopeslayer!!!</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Dark Crucible</b><br>
      Entry to the dungeon is no easy feat. You must first complete three other
      quests, each requiring an Upper &amp; a Lower team. The reward from each
      of the Upper sides will give you a piece required to create the Dark
      Crucible -- a magical artifact to be given to an Emissary of Asheron. The
      first quest, the <a href="Cloister.htm">Empyrean
      Cloister</a>, will give you the Skull of Averon Palacost. The 2nd, into <a href="ShadowHeaume.htm">Shade
      Stronghold</a>, will give you the Heart of Shadow. The prize for the 3rd
      quest is the <a href="VAmulet.htm">Fragment
      of the Singularity</a>. (Find out more about these items in <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Missive.htm">Asheron's
      Missive</a>, given by the Chosen of Asheron during the Child of Daralet
      event.)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Combine the Heart of the Shadow with the
      Fragment of the Singularity to make the Dark Singularity. Combine the Dark
      Singularity with the Skull of Averon Palacost to make the Dark Crucible.
      Take the Dark Crucible to the Chosen of Asheron in Cragstone (23.6N,
      49.1E) or Hebian-to (41.9S, 83.0E) who will give you a portal gem to enter
      the Sepulcher of the Hopeslayer. (You can also receive <a href="../../Culture/Texts/2ndMissive.htm">Asheron's
      Second Missive</a>.)&nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Sepulcher of the
      Hopeslayer is restricted to Levels 36+, but it is strongly recommended
      that you be in your mid to upper 40s before attempting the quest. Before
      using the portal gem, make sure you are outside on flat ground with the
      area in front of you clear. You group will only have a short time to use
      the portal, so make sure everyone is ready to jump in before you use the
      gem!</font></p>

      <font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">
      <a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.com/map.php?id=02B0">Sepulcher of the Hopeslayer</a></font></span></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Preparation</b><br>
      The entrance room is safe, with the exception of a hard-to-see dark
      surface portal close to where you materialize. Be cautious! Wait to move
      until you fully appear, then move closer to the black obsidian pillar, so
      you don't get whisked out inadvertently. (That would suck!)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Before buffing, your group
      will need to organize. Inside the dungeon there is a lever, and further on
      a button, which must be used to activate doors below. Designate a small
      group of people to stay behind to pull the lever before joining up with
      the rest of the group (keep a mage in this group to help heal). Only one
      person should be required to push the button later on.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now buff! Buff, buff, buff,
      buff, buff! The dungeon is treacherous! It's thick with Destroyer,
      Harrower and Bane Grievvers, plus Umbris and Panumbris Shadows. Bane with
      Lightning, Acid, Piercing and Bludgeon, and use all 7 life protects, level
      VII recommended.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mages will mainly be
      imperiling and healing. Use a <a href="Heart.htm">Healer's Heart</a> if
      you have one and watch everyone's health. Once you get past the initial
      city area, you'll be walking on a floor from which you will continuously
      take 9-11 damage as you walk on it. The safe areas are on the slopes, and
      in the pods. Have some Health Potions or Elixirs on hand, just in case.
      Fighters will kill.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The First Lever</b><br>
      When everyone is ready, head over to the west wall of the entry room where
      you'll see three metal doors. Take the left door (cast weaken lock then
      pick open) and head down. Almost immediately you'll be attacked by about 8
      Grievvers and 4 Shadows. After killing them, you'll see a large open room
      with a lever on the floor right in the middle. Leave your lever group here
      while the rest of the group heads straight through the city heading
      West.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When you get to the three
      way split, take the middle (west) passage. Cross a grated floor and take
      the ramp down. You'll fight more Greivvers &amp; Shadows. Head around to
      the right, then through an organic round door into the floor eating
      section.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#99FF99">The Shadow-twisted organic
      floor absorbs 9 points of your flesh as you walk on it.<br>
      The Shadow-twisted organic floor absorbs 11 points of your flesh as you
      walk on it.<br>
      The Shadow-twisted organic floor absorbs 10 points of your flesh as you
      walk on it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The floor, combined with
      lag, can be deadly (I should know ;-). You may wish to turn your graphics
      settings down. And don't forget to heal!! Straight ahead, past the room
      with the corpses hanging from the ceilings is the first lever activated
      door. Move directly to the left of this door and wait on the sloped areas
      (still fighting Grievvers &amp; Shadows all the while) until the lever
      group is given the signal above. It's critical that the entire group gets
      through the first door before buffs expire. Once the lever has been
      pulled, everyone hustle through the door into the corridor. The upper
      group will run down to meet up with everyone here. Gather in one of the
      pods (where it's safe to stand) and rebuff.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 2nd Trigger<br>
      </b>The second door to be opened is across from the one everyone just came
      through. Once everyone has completed their buff cycle, the first door is
      reopened from the inside and the Grievvers pour in. Everyone can actually
      stay inside the pod while fighting them. When the coast is clear, send out
      the button pusher to trigger the 2nd door.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To get to the button, head
      through the SE door. Go straight, then head to the right. You'll run
      through several corridors and over uneven ground until you reach a
      chamber. The button is high up on the wall to your left. Be careful not to
      lose your way back! If the door closes behind you, you'll need someone
      from the group to open it from the other side, and they may be reluctant
      to venture out into danger after going through that 2nd door which only
      stays open for a limited time! You could find yourself standing there
      behind the locked door, while the floor chips steadily away at your health
      and the Grievvers come looking for you! (Thankfully, we survived the 2nd
      run to the button and were rescued from our predicament and made it
      through the 2nd door safely! ;-)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The Sepulcher of the
      Hopeslayer<br>
      </b>When you've made it through the 2nd door, you'll be standing on a
      ledge overlooking the final room. A purple mist is ahead and the Grievvers
      and Shadows swarm around on the ground below like angry ants. It's that
      time again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Buff like you've never
      buffed before. Bane your undies. Bane your armor. Bane your banes! Once
      again, all 7 life protects. Expect to die. When everyone is ready, start
      the Imperils. Then... jump! (Use shift-jump to avoid any wall weirdness on
      the jump.) One strategy is to jump in waves. Choose a victim to be the
      initial target and some buffed melees to be the first wave a second or two
      later. Mages are to continuously heal while they do some initial clearing.
      The 2nd wave of Melees and Archers jump next to help finish off the
      nasties, then the mages join below once the danger is past. Everyone
      should move towards the South section of the final room, near the altar
      and statues.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mages can shift-jump on top
      of the statues to heal and imperil from above in relative safety. Try to
      stay in that south alcove. If you venture out into the main room, you will
      draw Grievvers and Shadows from above to you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In addition to the 6-8 Bane
      Grievvers and ~4 Umbris Shadows, A Shadow of Black Ferah (level 153) also
      spawns. When Black Ferah is killed, the Blood of the Hopeslayer spawns on
      the corpse lying on the altar, the remains of Ilservian Palacost.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#99FF99">As Black Ferah falls, you hear a cold, contemptuous voice declare, "Do with the blood as they will, outlander. My true form stays close to my master, who you cannot kill!"</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now it's just a &quot;simple&quot; matter
      of camping and killing, and buffing and imperiling and so forth. The spawn
      occurs every 4 minutes or so, so it's not too bad a wait for everyone who
      needs the Blood <font color="#FFFFFF">(the </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Blood
      may not be dropped or given). When everyone has their prize, recall out!
      (There is a surface portal on the opposite side on the final room.)</font></p>
