        Viamontians, they're Isparians too. But Jed says we can't, and Robert...

        <font color="#FFFF99">Gromnie tells you, &quot;Yeah, they call me Gromnie. 
        It's a long story.&quot;<br>
		Gromnie tells you, &quot;I just can't stand this. Living in a cave, never 
		knowing when Varicci's men are going to attack... I can't stand it!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Matthias Eckhart tells you, &quot;Meeting the Count was a stroke of good 
		luck. He's been fighting Varicci since the Duke's rebellion back on 
		Ispar, and he's been training us!&quot;<br>
        Matthias Eckhart tells you, &quot;When Varicci's men came, we were just able 
        to get out of town before they raised those towers. We came here and 
        we've been making attacks and raids when we can. We're not going to just 
        sit back and let them take over our homes! We call ourselves the Carenzi, 
        because we're fierce and quick!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Arica tells you, &quot;Things are different now.&quot;<br>
		Arica tells you, &quot;You tell Jed, you tell Count Tenera, you tell them 
		that Antonia and I are as good as any of them.&quot;<br>
		Arica tells you, &quot;Count Tenera... he's pretty handsome, don't you think? 
		And so brave!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Antonia tells you, &quot;I just don't want them to catch me. They'll make me 
		talk.&quot;<br>
        Antonia tells you, &quot;Tell You think you're brave? Have you ever led four 
        Viamontian Knights into an ambush without a weapon in your hand? I 
        didn't think so.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Count Tenera tells you, &quot;Between me and you, this can't go on 
		indefinitely. These Carenzi are good fighters, but they're young and 
		inexperienced. I think they should try and get out of here, get to the 
		mainland. I hear Stonehold may still be safe.&quot;<br>
		Count Tenera tells you, &quot;When I heard that Varicci had invaded Marae 
		Lassel, I knew that the resistance here would need help. I didn't expect 
		to find a bunch of kids hiding out in a valley, but they have spirit.&quot;<br>
		Count Tenera tells you, &quot;I fought alongside Bellanesse on Ispar, so I 
		know Varicci and his tactics as well as anyone.&quot;<br>
		Count Tenera tells you, &quot;Let me tell you about the last time I saw a 
		Lifestone. There were five Eaters... and I got four of them.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Dar Rell tells you, &quot;What good are we doing? A bunch of nobodies trying 
        to fend off an invading army. Impossible! Sometimes I think we should 
        lay down our arms and go back home.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Robert Gutsmasher tells you, &quot;When the Viamontians stole into our cities 
		under cover of darkness, we were wholly unprepared. They killed many for 
		sport, then slew then again at their lifestones. The Viamontians knew 
		they could not entirely kill our people, but that didn't stop them from 
		their murderous lust, laughing and shouting at the screams of the 
		dying.&quot;<br>
        Robert Gutsmasher tells you, &quot;Now the damnable curs occupy our towns 
        while we scratch out a living in this meager cave. I would seek revenge 
        on those augmented beasts if I were more able. But I am forced to remain 
        here and oversee the feeding of our sick and wounded.&quot;<br>
        Robert Gutsmasher tells you, &quot;You, however, could do me a favor. There 
        is a type of Viamontian Knight called the Man-At-Arms. Those ones, I 
        find especially irritating. Kill 50 of them for me, and I will reward 
        you for your efforts.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Jedeth Eckhart tells you, &quot;Those Viamontian scum are up to something! 
        Our scouts have reported a large gathering of soldiers, but they don't 
        seem to be doing anything. We need someone to sneak into their midst to 
        find out what their plan is. Use the Back Tunnel to sneak in and find 
        out what they are up to.&quot;<br>
        Jedeth Eckhart tells you, &quot;Be careful! Those Viamontian are well trained 
        and would easily skewer one so puny as yourself!&quot;</font></span><p align="left">
