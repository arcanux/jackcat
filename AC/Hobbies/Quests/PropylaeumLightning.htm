      hot. A few <a href="../../Pets/olthoi.htm">Olthoi</a> 
      Nobles greet your arrival. In the first section you'll also encounter 
      Evicerators. Buff for Acid, Piercing and Bludgeoning, and also bane your 
      undies. The beginning section is similar to the easier Fire &amp; Ice 
      dungeons. You'll take the first right from the entry and head down the 
      ramp. Fight your way through the Olthoi until you reach the edge of the 
      acid pit. Shift jump down from the east side of the pit (facing west) and 
      immediately head for the west wall to get yourself out of the acid as fast 
      as possible. When you've cleared the area of Olthoi, go down to the end of 
      the hall and retrieve a Hammer of Lightning from the purple chest (30 day timer).</span></font><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After everyone has a 
      Hammer, take the south passage and head down the spiral staircases. Rebuff 
      at the top of the 2nd set of staircases before heading down to the portal 
      area. It's full of Olthoi. When 
      you reach the room with the two portals, you'll need to split into an 
      upper (bracelet) and a lower (prism) group. Each side will pull a series 
      of levers and switches to open doors for the other side. Choose one person 
      from each group to communicate with the other.</font></span><p>

      wall. Wait at the door (Da) until the lowers find their first lever. Once 
      through, you'll be in a large open room full of golems, with passages on 
      all 4 sides. Take the hall on the north wall, then 
      take a left at the split. Wait for the lowers to be in position, then 
      pull the lever (L1).</font></span><p><span lang="en-us">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Head back to the large open room and take the 
      passage on the south wall to reach your second door (Db). When the lower 
      group has opened your door, head up the ramp, then go north (left) at the 
      4 way intersection. Head up another ramp and you'll see your next door 
      (Dc). You'll now be in another large room with golems and elementals. Take 
      the north passage through a large room, go north again (either way at the 
      split) and pull the lever for the lowers (L2). </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, head back to the 
      large room with the doors; take the west passage and head up a spiral 
      staircase. Your third lever (L3) is straight ahead. Next go west up a ramp and through a large 
      hexagonal room. Take a right at the split and the 
      next lever (L4 - pit) is in at the end of the passage. From the lever, go 
      back to the &quot;T&quot;, take a right up a ramp and you'll reach the ledge overlooking the grated 
      area.</font></span><p><span lang="en-us">
      <font face="Arial" size="2">This last part requires some jumping. Do  a full running jump across to 
      a raised grated platform. Aim for the SE corner since it has grated walls 
      which will catch you if you overshoot your mark. Next, head to the SW corner and make a small 
      kitty-corner tap jump over. If still needed, pull the lever (L4) to open the final door for 
      the lowers. Make another full running jump to the east, then take the 
      final passageway to the room containing the Chest with the Galvanic 
      Bracelet. The bracelet is no-give.</font></span><p><span lang="en-us">

      first lever in an alcove straight ahead, guarded by Diamond and Pyreal

      their door. Head back to where you started and take the passage in the 
      opposite direction to your first locked door (D1). Once 
      the uppers have opened it, wait inside (or stand in the doorway to keep it 
      open) for the uppers to

      your left and you'll be at your third 
      lever (L3). Head back to the split and go west into an open room. Your 
      second door is on the north wall (D2).</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once the uppers have opened 
      it, follow the passage (ignoring any passages or alcoves on your right)

      tricky -- pull up and away at an angle. After you've jumped, go down the ramp, take a left at the 
      T. The small room you'll enter is full of dispel traps! If you need, 
      re-buff in the hall. You'll next enter a big room with 3 elementals and a locked door on
