    the spell was changed as well. You'll love seeing it in action!</font></span><p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin, speak to Dizah ibn 
    Nadqab at the Four Towers outside of Zaikhal. The Four Towers Entrace portal 
    is at 12.4N, 2.3E. The portal to the Impious Temple is behind a locked door 
    within the courtyard at 12.2N, 2.4E, Dizah requires a L Trade Note to open 
    the door.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
    Dizah ibn Nadqab tells you, &quot;While excavating this site, I inadvertently 
    awakened the undead that rest here. I was able to escape the dungeon with my 
    life, but before doing so I found a large audience chamber with treasure.&quot;<br>
    Dizah ibn Nadqab tells you, &quot;Offer me any trade note worth 5000 pyreals and 
    I'll give you access to the dungeon. In return, you can keep anything you 
    find in there. I can use the trade note to further my investigation in this 
    site.&quot;<br>
    Dizah ibn Nadqab tells you, &quot;From what I was able to uncover so far, I 
    believe this area was once a place used by powerful Gharu'ndim War Mages. 
    Any relics you find may be difficult or impossible for you to use. Perhaps, 
    if you are skilled in Gharu'ndim War Magic you may be able to understand 
    what I could not. You can't go down there if you're not level 20, in fact I 
    wouldn't go down there if I were you. Just forget the whole thing, you're 
    better off that way.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">You give Dizah ibn Nadqab Trade Note.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Dizah ibn Nadqab tells you, &quot;I take this with 
    gratitude. I'll open the door for you, but be warned, this is a risky 
    venture. If you should fail, you will return to this place outside of the 
    sealed tower...And I give no refunds.&quot;<br>
    Dizah ibn Nadqab says, &quot;Oh, if you find something of interest I might be 
    able to identify it for you.&quot;<br>
    Dizah ibn Nadqab says, &quot;You should hurry. I'll close the door for you in a 
    minute.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Impious Temple is

    </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">1. The main floor of the temple has 
    four quadrants, one for each key. The Superna Key is located in the 
    northeast room. From the entrance, go straight through the intersection and 
    down the ramp. Ignore the first ramp on the right and keep heading down the 
    hallway. When you reach the open room, take the passage on the south wall 
    and head east. From there just follow the corridor up and around a few sets 
    of stairs, fighting the
    <a href="../../Pets/skeleton.htm">Skeletons</a> and 
    Skeleton Warriors until the final room. The Superna Key is on the corpse of 
    a Skeleton Warrior.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">2. If you have portal 
    recall, use it to return to the entrance. Your second key, the Infernus Key, 
    is found in the southeast room. Simply hug the right wall all the way up to 
    the final room. The key is on a
    <a href="../../Pets/skeleton.htm">Skeleton Warrior</a>.</font></span></p>

            Key is in the southwest room, opposite the previous key. From the 
    entrance, hug the left wall this time, all the way up to the final room. the

    Skeleton Captain</a>.</font></span></small></small></small></small></small></small></small></small></font></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">4. The final Mortus Key is 
    to the northwest. From the entrance take the 2nd passage north. Again pass 
    by the first corridor and head north. When you take the south doorway from 
    the open room, you'll turn right heading east. Follow the staircases to the 
    final room where a <a href="../../Pets/skeleton.htm">
    Skeleton Warrior</a> holds the key.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Before you head to the 
    lever section you may want to explore the lower level. Take the first ramps 
    you passed by for the first and fourth key to reach the lower level. Dizah's 
    Journal spawns on the ground, guarded by

    </font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">To reach the lever section, you'll 
    need to find the section of grate that has an opening. The ramp you're 
    looking for is in the NW section. Head as if you're getting the key; however 
    when you reach the pillared doorway on the south wall of the room, turn left 
    and head up the ramp instead. Look for the opening, then enter the large 
    open room with the barrels in the corners.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">This part requires some 
    coordination and speed. First look for the door on the SE wall. On the other 
    side are three small rooms, 2 with levers. Pull both levers (L1 and L2), 
    then run back to the NW corner of the barrel room. The door will now be open 
    (D1). Three more room are on the wall to the north. One has a surface portal 
    and the other 2 have levers. Pull both levers (L3 and L4). Head north then 
    turn left at the dead end. The locked door on your left is opened by the 
    Superna Key (resist 999). Another door behind it (D3) should now be open. 
    Pull the lever (L5) then quickly head back to the hallway. Immediately to 
    the west, repeat the process. Use the Inferus Key on the locked door, pull 
    the lever behind the door (L6) and head back to the hallway. The two doors 
    (D5 and D6) on the SW hallway should now be open.</font></span></p>
