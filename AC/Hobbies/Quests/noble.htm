	Toberik tells you, &quot;My efforts to uncover the details of the treaty between 
	the Burun and the Renegades has turned up very little as of yet. Though I

	Well Isparian, it appears as though you brought this report to me in good 
	time. Toberik means to detain Morgluuk's brother, Torgluuk, so that we can 
	face just the one brother. The plan is not without trouble though. We have 
	managed to learn much from the blueprints that we obtained from the Burun 
	fortress in the Blackmire Swamp.&quot;<br>
	Captain K'rank tells you, &quot;Currently, we believe that the best course of 
	action is to approach the fortress from there north. The walls are weaker 
	there, it appears as though the Renegade builders have been spending more 
	time trying to discern the goals of the Burun and not enough on shoring up 
	their work.&quot;<br>
	Captain K'rank tells you, &quot;This will not be a simple fight. We will need you 
	to be quick and efficient in your assault. We Lugians will assist the 
	Tumeroks of Marae Lassel in laying an assault against one of the Renegade 
	fortresses to provide you a small amount of assistance.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Captain K'rank tells you, &quot;Once you break the walls

	the fortress. Find your way through and defeat Morgluuk. He is very strong, 
	there may be ways to weaken him without facing him... I would advise trying 
	to find a way to weaken him before assaulting him directly.&quot;<br>

	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Confucius of FF reports:</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    A group of us just finished the Morgluuk quest. It starts by visiting the 
    Lugian NPC named Toberik at the bottom of the bunker in the Lugian Fort at 
    28.5S, 65.5W. He'll give you a note that you take to Captain K'rank at 
    Linvak Tukal. Then you go to the Fortress in the swamps 15 clicks south of 
    Yanshi at 25.5S 46.3E. You need to kill the door in the back to get in... I 
    found that pierce rending worked really well, though I think someone 
    debuffed the door too.<br>
    <br>
    There are three portals hidden in this Fortress. Two are located at ground 
    level in alcoves on the sides, and are masquerading as rocks. These dungeons 
    are full of fairly high level Buruns of both the big and small variety, plus 
    some patches of hallways with poisonous fumes that do a whole lot of damage 
    very quickly. In one of these dungeons is a new Guruk called a Guruk Titan 
    Watcher (level 151). When you kill it, it says something about screaming 
    out, which causes Morgluuk's forces to come to the rescue and leave Morgluuk 
    less guarded (sorry I didn't get a screenshot of this). I'm assuming you can 
    do the same thing in the portal on the other side of the fortress, though I 
    never went in there.</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">As the 
	Titan dies, it let's out a wail. Morgluuk will send his personal guard of 
	Guruk to investigate. Morgluuk's lair will be weaker.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Then you go back to the surface of the Fortress (there are exit portals 
    inside the dungeons) and run up the walls inside the Fortress into a room 
    suspended over the courtyard below. There's a third hidden portal 
    masquerading as a rock in here, leading to a dungeon full of much tougher 
    Buruns, and a lot more of them. Take the left fork, then hang a right and 
    you'll eventually get to the bottom -- a room with probably 20-30 Burun 
    guarding Morgluuk himself. Best to have at least 5-6 people here to kill 
    him, though we managed to do it with only 4. </font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#66FF99" face="Arial" size="2">Ruuk Fiend 
	Watcher suffers a frozen fate!<br>
	As the Fiend dies, it lets out a vicious sound. It's ward is unprotected, 
	Morgluuk will send his personal guard of savages to investigate. This will 
	weaken his lair.</font></span></p>
	<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">As Muric 
	smashed Morgluuk, the Guruk in the area grow more agitated and the Ruuk 
	become more docile!</font></span></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The egg explodes violently. A 
	shrill sound reverberates off of the halls, Morgluuk is howling in pain. 
	This egg may have contained his offspring! He has become weaker!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">As the Shaman dies, it lets 
	out a curse in an unintelligible language. It's [sic] death throes will 
	alert Margluuk and he will dispatch shamans from his lair to learn of what 
	happened here. His lair will become weaker.</font></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once he's dead, he leaves 
    one head and about 12 pieces of flesh on his corpse. Let the guy who got the 
    kill have the head, as it will give him a global when he turns it in, but 
    everyone (including the guy who got the head) can get a piece of flesh. Then 
    take the head and flesh back to Captain K'rank at Linvak Tukal for your 
    reward.<br>
    <br>
    For the flesh, he gives you 1.5 million xp, and a portal gem and a key. The 
    portal gem takes you to a Reward room full of locked chests. Each chest has 
    a different &quot;Noble&quot; weapon, one for each class, including a wand for mages, 
    as well as fairly good loot. The key can only be used once. For the head, he 
    gives you 5 million xp, another gem, another key, and the global:<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Confucius has slain Morgluuk and returned his head to 
    the Lugian capital of Linvak Tukal. There it is to be placed on a pike as a 
    symbol of victory for the Isparian, Lugian and Tumerok people and a symbol 
    of defeat for the Burun that threaten our way of life. Huzzah, Confucius!<br>
    </font><br>
    I got the 2nd global on Frostfell... Public Agent beat us by maybe an hour, 
    though I think his said something about Hebian-to instead of Linvak Tukal... 
    I wasn't paying enough attention. I'm not sure how this is linked to 
    Blackmire 4, unless it somehow activates the quest.<br>

	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Sweet Mary of WE's report:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Myself, my vassal Chris the Great, and two 
	others who we met up with, completed this quest in the early hours of this 
	morning and were the first to get the global for turning in the head. Here's 
	the global (credit should be for the whole team not just myself)...<br>
	<br>
	First we spoke to the Lugian Toberik in the Tummie Fortress (28.5S, 65.5W) 
	from a few patches back. You go into the building left of the portal down 
	inside the fort, and find the room with boxes that you can jump up on to get 
	through the hole in the floor above where Toberik is.<br>
	<br>
	Then we went to see K'rank in Linvac and gave him the note from Toberik.<br>
	<br>
	Then we went to the new Fortress at 25.5S 46.3E that had blueprints last 
	month. You kill the door to get in. (see pic)<br>
	<br>
	There are 4 entries that have invisible portals. You walk into the rock just 
	inside and the rock portals you (it's like entering into little caves.<br>
	<br>
	In each of the 4 caves (4 dungeons) you kill something that weakens the 
	boss. Here are screen shots of local messages for each of the 4 kills...<br>
	<br>
	Then having weakened the boss, you go up (climb up the building on the 
	inside of the wall within the fortress) and find another invisible rock 
	portal inside a room up above which takes you to he 5th and final dungeon. 
	We went down and found Morgluuk and kicked his arse. Pic with the local 
	message...<br>
	<br>
	Morgluuk drops one head and several other thingies that you turn in for your 
	reward. There is a 14 day timer on these.<br>
	<br>
	We found that after about 10mins, Morgluuk will spawn again, but since the 
	four dungeons have not been done, he is not weakened and much harder to 
	kill. So it would appear that maybe you can skip the first four dungeons, 
	skip right to the 5th, but then be faced with a much harder Morgluuk to 
	kill.<br>
	<br>
	You turn in the head and other thingie to a (think it was a Royal Guard) and 
	he gives you XP (5mil for head, something less for the other thingie), a 
	reward key, and a recall gem. The recall gem takes you to a small dungeon 
	with no badies, and you use the key (or keys) to get a reward from a chest 
	(one chest for each weapon named appropriately).<br>
	<br>
	I got the wand and dagger. Here's their stats (in pics)...<br>
