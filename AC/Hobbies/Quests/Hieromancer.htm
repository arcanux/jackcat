      Huxter must have been on art crack last month! February 2001's Lonely in
      the World event offers not only this fab new super-hero armor, but also
      the coolest item in the game: the Globe of Auberean. What does it do, you
      ask? Nothing! It just looks super neat-o cool.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Armor Lore</b><br>
      To start this multi-item quest you'll need a little bit (ok, a lot) of
      luck and several miscellaneous items. First buy a Puzzle Box from the
      wandering Archmage in the desert near Tufa. Next buy an &quot;unreadable
      text&quot; from the randomly spawning Spertat the Ursuin Hunter He's
      rumored to appear after an Ursuin has been killed everywhere from the road
      outside of Cragstone to the Crater (non-confirmed). Use the Puzzle Box to
      decode the text then have Bertself translate it in Cragstone. The
      resulting text is <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Thaumaturgic.htm">On the
      Proper Use and Care of Thaumaturgic Plate</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Key</b><br>
      Next you'll need to find yet another randomly spawning vendor in the South
      Direlands, Zairente Ra-Yao, and purchase a Peculiar Old Dagger. (Buy a
      bunch. They may be dropped or given away). But it's not actually a dagger!
      It's a key in disguise, but so crusted with gunk and filth that you'll
      need some powerful acid to clean it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Acid that you can get off Grievvers! (Mages love this part!) Grab a melee buddy and go hunting in the
      mountains outside the Hieromancer's Hall 4.4S by 82.8W. It's reported that
      the Grievvers seem easier to fight than the ones on the plains.&nbsp;Acid
      is dropped by Bane (3% drop rate), Harrower (3% drop rate), and Virulent
      (1% drop rate) Grievvers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Vial of Organic Acid is very rare and
      it's no-drop, no-give. In addition, it's on a one week quest timer. You'll
      get the message that you've completed the quest too recently at the time
      of looting if you've already picked up a vial.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When you use the Acid on the Dagger, you'll
      get a Glittering Crystalline Key which can be used on the randomly spawning
      Humming Crystal for a Lyceum Recall Gem. The key cannot be dropped or
      given away.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Stones</b><br>
      Before getting your Recall Gem, travel to the Hieromancer's Hall (4.4S by
      82.8W). Beware! A Diamond Golem guards the entrance! (Just kidding. It's a
      <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Lonely4.htm" target="_blank">Zirconium
      Golem</a> :)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> Buff fully before entering. The Halls are deadly, full of
      Umbris, Astyyrians, high level Banderlings, Magma Golems and more. There
      are many switches and levers to activate as you work your way through to
      the room with the Kindling Stones. Use the link at the top right for more
      details. Each of the three stones rests on a
      pedestal. Grab an armload of each to use on your armor later. The Kindling
      Stones cannot be dropped or given away.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before leaving, you'll want to do some
      exploring for a Blue Orb. Take one of the doors behind the kindling
      stones, and make your way past the 2 Iron Golems.
      Pass through a door, then another until you enter a large square room with
      stone couches. Examine the right wall carefully and you'll discover a
      secret passageway. Follow it down to the Vapor Golem who guards the Orb
      and a Sturdy Iron Key chest.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You'll also encounter the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Lonely3.htm" target="_blank">Guardian
      Spirit</a>, a level 100 creature which will cast every inept in the book.
      When you kill it, you'll get a message that some of its power has been
      transferred to you and you'll be buffed with Magic Resistance VI.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you have your Orb and your Kindling
      Stone, you are ready for your training! You'll need to find a Humming
      Crystal portal. They're rumored to spawn everywhere in the Direlands but
      in the plains.
      Hop through and use your Glittering Crystal Key on the Humming Crystal for
      your Lyceum Recall Gem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Note:</b> One high level mage friend,
      Danier, suggests <i>not</i> doing the quest in this order for a few
      reasons: 1) The unkindled armor is no-drop on death, important in more
      difficult, no recovery areas; 2) Mages are often short on pack space --
      even with a 320 War Magic skill he broke 5 of 9 stones. Better to kindle
      near the 25 second stone spawn then try to carry a ton of no-drop no-give
      pack hogging stones; 3) you'll lose the chance to grab the Blue Orb first,
      but since it's droppable and givable, a friend can grab one for you. Or
      you can just go back in a week after the Grievver timer expires.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Lyceum</b></font><font class="BaseFont" size="2" face="Arial"><br>
      The Lyceum, a training ground for War Mages, is located at 87.8S, 49.0E.
      Before asking Eaushi the Trainer to transport you to the training
      dungeons, you might do some exploring. In the powerstation and building up
      the hill from the Lyceum you can find a Lightweight Tome (no-drop,
      no-give) and a Titan Mana Charge behind an altar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Guarding the entrance to the Lyceum is a
      Diamond Golem. He will not attack unless you attack first. When you kill it, it will drop a key (no-drop, no-give, 1 week timer)
      which opens a trunk (in the building on the square) containing Sasalia's Dress. The Trainer has a use for
      that Blue Orb you found as well. Hand it to him and in exchange you'll
      receive the Globe of Auberean. Iseri Shasar of Wintersebb has this tip for
      killing the Guardian Golem: just bolt them and run
    behind wall and repeat until dead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin your training, retrieve the slip
      of paper (25 second spawn) from the second floor of the Lyceum. Hand it to </font><font class="BaseFont" size="2" face="Arial">Eaushi
      the Trainer&nbsp; and you'll be ported into the training dungeon. You'll
      have three doors to choose from.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> The
      easiest is the left route which will give you the Girth. Buff with Fire,
      Lightning and Bludgeoning protects, kill the golems within, and get a
      Small Pale Crystal off the final Tenuous Nephol Golem (level 40). The golems are
      resistant to everything but War Magic. It's reported that it's possible
      for a melee to kill them, but it's a lengthy, difficult task. Contrary to
      rumors, both Life and Creature Magic work fine on the Golems. When you're ready, head back to the Training Master,
      hand him your crystal, and in exchange, you'll receive your girth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Retrieve a slip of paper again for entrance
      back to the training dungeon for your second training session. This
      dungeon, a harder version of the first, will yield a Pale Crystal (from
      Diaphanous Nephol Golem -- Level 65) which
      can be exchanged for your Leggings. In addition, this dungeon also has a
      locked chest (difficulty ~350) which contain the Boots of the
      Vault. They come as two separate feet which must be combined in order to
      use them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before leaving either the first or the
      second dungeon, you might want
      to hang around, killing golems. Eventually, on a random spawn, one will
      drop a Sunstone Geode which can be turned into the cool looking
      Hieromancer's Orb!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For your coat, bring a third slip of paper
      to the Training Master for your final Crystal to make your Coat. These Golems are the most
      challenging (Turbid Nephol Golem -- Level 125) ) and will be throwing Level V debuffs at you.
      All attack with Bludgeoning Melee attacks and Lightning and Fire Magic
      Attacks. These highest level golems cast Imperil V, Level VI attacks and
      Level V Vulns. The Golems are vulnerable to frost, so a good plan is to
      use Frost Vulnerability and Magic Yield. You might also consider bringing
      a few Gems of Stillness with you to handle debuffs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Kindling The Armor</b><br>
      To kindle the armor, you'll use the stones you got from the Hieromancer's
      Hall. CAUTION! If you do not have War Magic specialized, only use ONE
      stone per piece. Mages with war specialized can use two stones per piece.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      The unkindled armor is no-drop, no-give. You will only be able to redeem
      one suit per month. When the armor is kindled, it is both droppable and
      may be given; it can be enchanted, and can be lost on death. Only the mage
      who created the armor can activate its spells.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To make Thaumaturgic Plate, use one of the
      kindling stones on the armor -- whichever color you'd like. Make sure your
      War Skill is buffed as high as possible. It's very easy to break a stone
      (even with a War Skill near 300) and it's even possible to break the armor
      piece. To unkindle the armor, use the same type stone on the armor and it
      will revert back to its unkindled from.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Specialized War Mages may use two stones
      for Exarch plate. One stone creates Thaumaturgic Plate, two stones creates
      Exarch, and a third stone unkindles the armor. Now go forth and dazzle!</font></p>
