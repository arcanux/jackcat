		<span lang="en-us"><font size="2" face="arial">On April 1st, the mystery of Ulgrim's 
        disappearance was revealed. Numerous duplicate Ulgrims appeared in towns 
        across Dereth, each with their own unique personality. Several of them 
        mentioned a poser in Dryreach. The poser, of course, was the original 
        Ulgrim who had quite the tale to tell. Give him some stout (or a poured 
        beer) and he'll relate the story of how he tried to use a broken 
        lifestone when drunk. His wand exploded and and he was killed 
        repeatedly. All 9 of his corpses, instead of quietly decaying, became 
        walking animated copies of Ulgrim! To reconstitute himself he needs to 
        piece together his broken wand. To complete the quest travel to the 
        different cities of Dereth and ply the imposter Ulgrims with drink until 
        they give you splinters of the wand. When you have 9 pieces, give them 
        to Ulgrim in Dryreach and he'll give you a bathrobe as a reward!</font></span></p>

        from a mage shop.) The drink needed to produce each splinter is also 
        listed for each Ulgirm. Visit the
        <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains/Food.htm">Food 
        Bargains</a> page for a list of cities that sell the different alcoholic 
        beverage. You can also visit Ulgrim's Isle and kill a 10th version -- 
        Ulgrim the Unruly. A splinter will be on the corpse.</font></span></p>

    They are doing a paroidy of <i>Behind the Music</i> with the group Blue 
    Oyster Cult's and their song <i>Don't Fear the Reaper</i>. In this Walken's 
    character is a record producer and wants to hear more cowbell in the song. 
    Will Farrel's character is the 'hidden' member of the band in charge of the 
    cowbell. It is a classic SNL skit.</span></p>

    <font color="#FFFF99">Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Oh, I'm so vitae'd 
    up, still I suppose I'm lucky to be alive.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;It all started a week ago when I decided 
    to go on a trip. I was tired of all the the sun and relaxation, you know how 
    it is. Anyway, I traveled around for awhile visiting pubs and inns and ended 
    up in Dryreach, where I was astonished to find a wonderful house brew made 
    by my friend Mordomor. He's downstairs.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I decided to spend awhile getting to know 
    the drink better so I went to find the old lifestone NW of town. Yeah, I 
    know there's a new lifestone now, but I didn't know that then. The old 
    lifestone looked broken, but by this time I was heavily in my cups and 
    unconcerned with trivial things.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Now, I'm going to give you a very 
    important bit of information here. Never ever, under ANY circumstances, bind 
    to a lifestone when your drunk. And if you have an old faulty wand. And if 
    it looks like the lifestone's broken... especially if it looks like the 
    lifestone is broken. I remember wondering why the lifestone was sparking 
    like that, then why my wand was sparking like that. Then my wand caught 
    fire, shot from my hand and exploded... then things got weird.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Everything after that is fuzzy, but I 
    remember dying repeatedly. Not something I recommend, but what with all the 
    explosions and electric shocks it seemed like the thing to do. My life 
    flashed before my eyes, at least the part that involved being repeatedly 
    killed and revived by a demented lifestone.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;When I came to I found that the bodies I 
    had left during my reincarnations hadn't died. In fact there were nine 
    copies of myself standing around arguing with each other. I could have sworn 
    that I died more than nine times, but like I said before I was pretty 
    vitae'd up.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I've heard of similar lifestone 
    malfunctions before. Usually the duplicate is just a creepy standing corpse 
    of sorts that hasn't forgotten how to breathe. In most cases unbinding from 
    your lifestone will return that corpses lifeforce or vitae back to its 
    owner.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;But to unbind from the lifestone I needed 
    to use the same casting device that I tied to it with. By the time I found 
    one of my wand's splinters in the pocket of my robe I realized the 
    duplicates of me had run off. I am fairly certain that they each have a 
    splinter from my wand.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;I need you to seek out my copies and 
    acquire their splinters. Luckily they don't appear to be as smart as I am. 
    Get them good and drunk and you should be able to trick them into giving you 
    the splinter. Once I have all of the splinters I'll be able to recraft the 
    wand, unbind from that damned lifestone and pull myself together.&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Succeed and I'm sure I can find a little 
    something to reward your help.&quot;<br>

    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Have you ever noticed a bird pause in 
    flight for a second or two?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Impossible, right, but it happens. What if 
    the little hiccups are when someone changes reality?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;What if we're just playthings for some 
    greater power?&quot;<br>
    Ulgrim the Unpleasant tells you, &quot;Heh, it would make a good story. I guess 
    I've had a lot of time to think up crazy ideas.&quot;<br>

    something like that.&quot;</font></p>

    Nuhmudira having all sorts of medals and honors bestowed on her?&quot;<br>
