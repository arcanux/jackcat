<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">On Nov. 6, 2003 during the
<a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Terror2.htm">Reign of 
Terror</a> event Nuhmudira appeared in Zaikhal at 13.8N 0.6E. She sought items 
needed for a ritus she planned to perform in order to rid the world of the Ancient Olthoi 
Queen. </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">In the capital of the Gharu'ndim people, Nuhmudira awaits 
the arrival of brave souls that will assist her in the destruction of the Olthoi 
Queen.<br>
She arrives with no fanfare, alone, and humbly requesting the assistance of any 
who would see the people of Ispar free.</font></span></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">
Nuhmudira relays that she has offered assistance to the Virindi in quelling the 
renegade Lugians and Tumeroks in exchange for objects of great power. The first 
of these 3 objects is found in Gerent's Compound</span></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">

<p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells 
you, &quot;This menace needs to end. As I stated before, if Elysa is unable to end 
this, I will handle it myself. This Ancient Olthoi Queen has proven to be too 
great a menace to confront in a direct assault.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I've been studying her movements, watching her actions 
from afar, my perspicacity has allowed me to discover a weakness. But this 
weakness is not one that can easily be exploited.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Nuhmudira sighs.<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;As much 
as I dislike admitting when Asheron is correct, he has spoken true of the 
capacity of our bodies and the fragility of our forms. None, like you, will ever 
achieve the understanding that he possesses. This is a moment when we shall 
shine brighter than the Empyrean ever did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;But this triumph will not come without sacrifice. I will 
need assistance in collecting several items necessary for this undertaking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;To that end I have made decisions that will be considered 
suspect, but they are ultimately a necessity to see our continued prosperity. I 
beg your forgiveness now, of the affront that these words will undoubtedly be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I have offered assistance to the Virindi in the 
apprehension of the renegade Lugians and Tumeroks who, until recent months, had 
firmly been under their rule. In exchange, the Gerent of their species has 
offered an item of ubiquitous power. This item must be retrieved if I am to 
channel enough energy into the ritus that I must perform.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;The Gerent is located at 87.3 south and 17.5 west. He 
awaits the arrival of any Isparian and if you are able to reach him, will freely 
gift this item to you. Aerbax, the once Virindi, has apparently set his lesser 
minions against the Gerent, and though this being is of some power, he is new to 
this physical plane and as a result is vulnerable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Reach him, obtain this item, and return it to me. I will 
need only one, and you will be recompensed for your sacrifice.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first item retrieved for 
Nuhmudira was a special inscribed Energy Crystal. When returned to her, she then 
gave information about the 2nd item of power, found in Aerbax's Holding at 
98.0S, 98.0W on the Singularity Caul (Levels 60-90). The 
<a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20949.html">Gerent of the 
Singularity</a> also gave the following note:</font></span></p>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99"><br>
You give Nuhmudira Energy Crystal.<br>
Nuhmudira's 
voice echoes on the wind. &quot;You have done very well, Giz. For your 
sacrifice I gift this to you. It is a small token of my appreciation.&quot; <br>
Nuhmudira gives you Energy Crystal.</font><br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;We have come closer to seeing the reign of this creature 
ended. Now, however, I must ask you to collect something of immense wickedness. 
When we freed ourselves from the Olthoi, we were given a time of respite; then 
came the Hopeslayer.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;With his arrival the end of a world not our own became 
imminent. Yet we rose, despite our initial ignorance, to a victorious ending. 
One that we were able to celebrate and look back upon now with fond memories. We 
claimed this world when we spilled the Hopeslayer's blood.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;We need a fragment of that darkness; it is a powerful 
focus. Without it, I fear I may lose my concentration during the ritus, and fail 
us all.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Aerbax holds this item now. In stasis, this object is 
protected by powerful wards. Perhaps within the confines of a dais.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;That is all I was able to decipher through my distant 
vision. I am sure that it has some bearing on what you will find there. 
Regardless of what you face, you must succeed and return this object to me. 
Without it, all is lost.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;He keeps it safe on his island. It is unlikely that he 
will know that we are making a move against this relic. Once he is aware that we 
have acquired such an antiquated and powerful artifact he will undoubtedly 
become enraged; then we shall need to face down the threat that he will pose.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Yet, if we do not crush the olthoi here and now, there may 
not be a future for us to face Aerbax down. So this must be done. You can find 
his laboratory somewhere near these locations: 98 south and 98 west.&quot; <br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Hurry, I need one of these objects as quickly as you can 
acquire them.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The second item was a Bracelet 
of Dark Essence. After receiving it, Nuhmudira directed adventurers to an 
Ancient Temple at </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> 33<span lang="en-us">.0S,
    </span>88<span lang="en-us">.0W (Levels 80+) </span>

&quot;Yes, this is the object that I needed, Daymare. You have performed 
extraordinarily. Take this with my thanks.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira gives you Nuhmudira's Bracelet.</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial" size="2">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;And now 
my child, we come to the most deadly of the tasks that I must ask of the 
Children of Ispar.&quot; <br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;In the farthest reaches of the western shore of Dereth, 
lying once beneath the waves, only now becoming present, is a temple. Ancient 
and timeless, a place of unknown fortune and foul intents has lain forgotten for 
millennia.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I need you to venture within the halls of this dark temple 
to collect a book for me. A book that is the compliment and conclusion to the 
ritus that I must undertake.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Now, I feel as though you must know what my intention is. 
The Olthoi Queen is an intelligent beast, capable of communicating with all that 
it views as its children. She is protective, matronly, and she has a weakness; 
the desire to protect and defend her young.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;The horde that has arrived beneath Dereth has come 
prepared to assail the island for as long as it may take to conquer, or destroy 
us. They have brought food stores, from wherever they last made their lairs. 
They have enough to support their horde for tens of years, perhaps hundreds.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;But we have been given a gift, for good or ill, by the 
undead that walk this world. A gift, a poison, that weakens and deadens the 
olthoi.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;With this, we can obliterate their race from Dereth once 
and for all; with fortune, perhaps from the world. My ritus will enable us to 
bring this about, my child.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I will join my very essence with the Olthoi Queen and 
share the visions within her mind. I will know when these food stores are 
undefended, and then I will send those with poison to contaminate these food 
holds.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;We will poison their food and kill them all. The Queen 
will be vulnerable through this ritus. While she is weakened we must make a 
unified strike against her.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I am certain that she will then bring her full forces to 
bear against us. We will not fail.&quot; <br>
<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Now, you must collect this book for me else I cannot 
complete this ritus. Without it the magic will be incomplete, and there will be 
no chance to accomplish our tasks.&quot; <br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Go quickly. The temple is located at 33 south and 88 west. 
Return the book to me, our future relies upon your haste.<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>
</font></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Bracelet of Dark 
Essence was returned to Nuhmudira, 
players received a book called &quot;Animal Talker&quot; as a reward.</font></span></p>

Nuhmudira's voice carries on the wind. &quot;Excellent...This book is the companion 
to my first. I will need to translate this correctly before I can lead our 
assault against the Olthoi Queen. Allow me to present you with this, Tetsujin 
Sujitsu.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira gives you Animal Talker.<br>
&quot;It's a book I hope will one day bring cheer to the hearts of the children of 
this world.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira's voice echoes across the land. &quot;Children of Ispar, I must translate 
the contents of this book and prepare myself for the ritus. You have performed 
beyond my expectation and I swear that we shall soon rid our world of these 
creatures. I will call you to me within two days. Then, I shall enact the ritus 
and we shall strike the final blow against the Olthoi horde!&quot;</font></span></p>

yourself for the spawn in the next room. Once you've cleared it, take the path 
in front of you, directly across the room.</span><br>

<span lang="en-us">Follow the ramp down through more twisting corridors until 
you reach a ramp with a fork. Take the right fork (the left leads to a dead end) 
with the door to the west. From the room, take the right door down another ramp. 
At the next split, take the left passage until you reach a long hallway. The 
Falatacot Abbess (Level 161) is in the final room, guarded by more Falatacot. 
Use the tome in the back of the room to receive the Living Tome. Recall out!</span></font></p>
