      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Getting to Chakron Flux</b><br>
      Getting to Chakron Flux (52.9S, 62.7W - restricted to Levels 36+) is an
      adventure in and of itself! Although you can also reach it by running from Tumideon Fortress (55.9S, 60.7W), the favored route is by running from
      Black Dominion Dungeon (49.0S, 66.0W). The entryway and the immediate area
      outside Black Dominion are safe. Gather here and buff for the first part
      of the run (buff for a regular Dires run). You'll encounter Obsidian &amp;
      Diamond Golems, Umbris Shadows, Virindi, Tuskers Guards and other various
      and sundry baddies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First run SE, aiming for 52.0S, 62.0W. When
      everyone arrives, kill the locals and regroup and rebuff. The next section
      is very dangerous; buff as if for a Plains run. Run to approximately
      54.6S, 63.0. Stop and regroup here, then head to approx. 55.2S, 64.0W
      where you will be making a hard right. Chakron Flux is atop the mountain.
      You will be able to see two plumes of purple energy shooting up from the
      earth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Chakron Gate</b><br>
      Chakron Gate Portal is restricted to levels 36+. Your entire group will
      complete the first half of the dungeon together. You'll then encounter two
      portals side by side: one to Lower Chakron Flux (Levels 36<span lang="en-us">+</span> and the
      other to Upper Chakron Flux (Levels 41+). The Virindi Amulet is the prize
      for the Lower group. The Upper group can get the Fragment of the
      Singularity (used in the Sword of Lost Hope quest).</font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Map: </font>
      <font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">
      <a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.com/map.php?id=02AE">Chakron Flux Entrance</a></font></span></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before entering, wait for any debuffs to
      wear off and group into your fellowships, one for the upper and one for
      the lower. Designate a leader for each group. The leader of the Lower
      Group will communicate with the leader of the Upper group once the quest
      splits. It's very important that only the leaders activate any buttons or
      switches inside. Since corpse looting permissions were introduced, the
      quest has become less risky. Previously, if you died, chances of body
      recovery were very slim.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once inside you'll encounter 2 Tusker
      Slaves and 2 Hollow Minions. Mages will probably want to wear a good set
      of armor, rather than a robe on this quest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At your first intersection make a left,
      then turn right. You'll get to your first open room with 2 Guards and a
      Tumideon Hollow Minion. Take the South passage out of the room then make
      the first right heading SW, then south again. You'll encounter a Virindi
      Master guarding a ramp down heading W. Take the ramp, then at the T make a
      right. At the next T head West then make the first right heading North.
      You'll then be in the 2nd large open room. Kill the Hollows &amp; the
      Virindi Master.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From the 2nd room take the door out at the
      North end and make a left at the T heading West. Turn heading north and
      fight your way past the Servants &amp; Guards. Pop into the East Alcove to
      buff and regroup. At your next intersection head North, then East. Go
      South at the T, then head East to the purple-y area. You'll see another
      ramp heading down. Take the ramp and keep heading South. Make a right into
      the 3rd room and kill the Virindi, Hollows &amp; Tuskers. You'll see the
      double portals to Upper &amp; Lower Chakron Flux.</font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Map: </font>
      <font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">
      <a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.com/map.php?id=02AF">Chakron Flux</a></font></span></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Lower Chakron Flux- Virindi Amulet<br>
      </b>The Lowers will take the left portal (restricted to Levels 36<span lang="en-us">+</span>).
      When you exit into Lower Chakron Flux you'll be confronted by a few Tusker
      Slaves and a Virindi Servant. Follow the corridor to the first big room.
      On the south side of the wall is a button which opens a door for the
      Uppers. Wait for them to your leader the signal before pushing it. You'll
      be fighting 2 Slaves, a Virindi Master and 2 Sotoris Hollow Minions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After you've pressed the button for
      the&nbsp; Uppers, continue until you reach a ramp. Head up, then you'll be
      on a ledge with a door on the other side. A ramp leads down into some
      purple energy sapping stuff. Wait for the Uppers to trigger the door, then
      jump across. The jump can be a little tricky. Some people like to jump
      from about 1/2 way down the ramp. Others stand on the ledge and do a
      forward jump at about 1/2 power. Once your group is across, head down the
      corridor, fighting past a few more Hollows, until you reach the first pit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Jump down into the pit and take the East
      passage. There will be some Virindi Servants and Tusker Slaves below. Soon
      you come to a large open room with a small purple-y chamber in the center.
      The second button is inside. Wait for the Uppers to give the signal, then
      continue on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You'll then be making a series of full
      power jumps over pits. Make the first jump, then wait for the Uppers to
      open the door on the other side. 2 Masters may spawn while you wait. After
      the door is opened, make your 2nd full power jump across. [This is where I
      died first time through! The pits contain electrical energy which will
      drain you. One has a portal back to the double portal area. Best bet is to
      recall out.]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You'll then jump down into another pit.
      Imperil the Tusker Slaves below first, then send the Melee folks down to
      clear the area. Take the West exit from the room then make a right heading
      north, and another right heading east. You'll enter a big room with a
      large crystal in the middle of the room and a locked door on the North
      side. Give the signal for the Uppers to open the door for you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the door is open, do a full power
      jump across the pit. Take a minute to buff before jumping down into the
      last room. It's a good idea to leave one person on the ledge above to kill
      the Master who spawns. The final room contains a Virindi Master (above)
      &amp; Servant, a Sotoris Hollow Minion, a Tusker Slave, a Virindi Observer
      and the Chakron Flux Servant. The Virindi Amulet spawns on the Chakron
      Flux Servant (approx every 5 minutes). The timer to get another Amulet is
      3 weeks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Upper Chakron Flux - Fragment of the
      Singularity<br>
      </b>The Uppers take the portal to the right (restricted to Levels 41+).
      When you enter, you'll encounter 2 Tumideon Hollow Minions, 2 Tusker
      Guards and a Virindi Master. The way through the dungeon is very
      straightforward. You'll enter the first large room. Kill the Guards &amp;
      Master then take the West exit. You'll then come to a room with a ramp
      heading up on the right side. You'll enter a purple-y room with a ledge
      that must be jumped across. Wait for the lowers to open the door, then
      jump to the hallway on the other side. Again, like with the Lowers, don't
      do a full power jump, but 1/2 power. If any in your group are having
      trouble, you can stand in the doorway to keep it open until everyone makes
      it across.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next you'll come to a pit. Imperil
      everything below then jump down. In the South Alcove at the bottom, behind
      the purple haze you'll find the button to trigger the door for the Lowers.
      Wait for them to give the signal before continuing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Head down the West corridor from here until
      you reach the 2nd large room. Watch out for the Master above. Take the
      East passage through the room and you'll find another door that must be
      opened by the Lowers. When the door opens, you'll be greeted by two
      Virindi Masters on the other side of a pit. Make a full power jump across,
      then jump across the 2nd pit with a full power jump.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the other side is a Lever which opens a
      door for the Lowers. Wait for the signal then follow the passage to the
      next ledge. Below are some Tumedion Hollows. Imperil, then jump below.
      You'll be in a large room with two big crystals with purple electricity
      flowing between them. Don't get too close! It casts Mana Drain. Running
      between the two crystals triggers another door for the Lowers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the hallway (South) you'll
      find the last locked door. Wait for the Lowers to open it, then do a full
      power jump across. Be extra careful in this last room. You'll have to
      fight the Chakron Flux Master, a Virindi Observer and a Virindi Master,
      and several Tumideon Hollow Minions. The Fragment of the Singularity
      spawns on the floor of the final room (approx 2-3 minutes). Again, there's
      a 3 week timer for the Fragment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As a final note, be sure to block out
      several hours for this quest. Big groups tend to move a little slower!</font></td>
