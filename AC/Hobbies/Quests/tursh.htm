	&quot;</span>Thought you'd like an update about the new sewer quest from Holtburg. 
	Friend of mine (Boce) and me tried to run it last night. First, the run was 
	really long. Much easier to shortcut from the Zatara housing settlement. 
	Then there are four large heads (four portals) for different levels. All 
	surrounded by spirits and poltergiests. And a couple of tumeroks just to be 
	sure you die:) I got inside the 80-100 (at least I think that is the 
	portal's requirements) and there are more poltergiests just down the hall, 
	but the drop is safe and nothing attacks you. My friend however had to take 
	the asylum portal (tower) because he was 125th level, which meant our 
	fellowship kinda died right there. I couldnt make it past the polts with 
	their magic so I didnt finish the quest but I thought you should know the 
	beginning really well.<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span></font><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">------------------</span></font><p>
	<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Zulu of TD reports on the 
    Lower Wing:</font></span><p>
	<font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>I did the lower 
    version of the Tursh Totem quest and here's some details.<br>
    <br>
    First, there are 4 level restricted Temple Portals as follows:<br>
    <br>
    Defiled Temple Lower Wing (40-59)<br>
    Defiled Temple Middle Wing (60-79)<br>
    Defiled Temple Upper Wing (80-99)<br>
    Defiled Temple Asylum (100+)<br>
    <br>
    There are three dungeons to each wing, the temple, the sewers, and the royal 
    vault.<br>
    I completed the 40-59 version solo with a level 59 Spear Character (with 
    life magic).<br>
    The temple area was full of Spirits and Sewer Rats. A couple of Specters 
    were there too. Killing a Spirit in the 'pit area' flags one to enter sewer 
    portal. Bring a stack of dispel gems for this area..Very fast spawn! The 
    sewers contained Gold and White Phyntos wasps, Sewer Rats, Spiked Grievvers, 
    and Apozims...again fast spawn but pretty straight forward to last portal. 
    The last area was the Royal Vault and it contained some Royal Guard NPC's 
    then Panumbris Shadows, Drudge Raveners, Augmented Drudges, Virindi 
    Observers and Councillors, and eventually the boss Lugian, Shoktok, a level 
    70 Lugian with around 5000 hp. I died in boss room first time through but 
    after rebuffing I could recall directly to Royal Vault. This time I was able 
    to land an Imperil V on Shoktok and take him down. He dropped a totem shard 
    that I turned in to the Holtburg NPC for 15% to level and the lowbie version 
    of Royal Oil. I attached Pics of Shoktok and Royal Oil lowbie style.<br>

	<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    At around 4:00 PM EST Deadlybow II, The Hill People, and I (Wild Hunt) went 
    and *tried* to do the tursh totem for levels 80-99. At first it seemed like 
    a breeze but further down it got worse. (NOTE: respawn timers are lightning 
    fast, and them rats are irritating.)<br>
    <br>
    Once you get into the level 80-99 Defiled Temple, you run down the corridor 
    and through the archways till you come to a big open room with a BIG pit. 
    There is a bridge in the middle of the pit. Kill all the Poltergeists than 
    shift jump on to the bridge. Kill the rats real fast. Find the room with a 
    Runed Chest and run down the corridor. Stick to the left walls and go down 
    again. If you're not fast enough the rats will respawn. When you run through 
    the corridor you will end up at the bottom of the pit. There are 5 or 6 
    special Poltergeists. Each person in the group has to be flagged by killing 
    a Poltergeist.<br>
    <br>
    Once everyone is flagged. Do a *Regular* Portal Recall. Then run through the 
    corridors and archways and run around the pit opening and through the second 
    set of corridors and archways and run into the Sewers Portal.<br>
    <br>
    Now the sewers are pretty straightforward. You will encounter Bane Greivvers, 
    Giant Phyntos Wasps, Infested Rats, and Miasmas. Run through the halls until 
    you run across a big room with 5 bridges in different locations and higher 
    up. Run through the halls until you cross each of the 5 bridges (It will 
    feel like you are running in circles but your not). Each time you cross a 
    bridge make sure you're up one higher than the last. After you cross the 
    last bridge you will come to a 3 way forked ramp. Run forward. You will end 
    up with a portal. Go in.<br>
    <br>
    Now you should rebuff. People that can't buff theirselves can go to a 
    mansion or hometown and *regular* portal recall back. Once everyone regroups 
    and is ready to go. You can Explore the Guards outpost until you're ready to 
    go. Go through the doors (it's easy enough to find) and run down a ramp. You 
    will encounter about 20 Unconquered Drudges on the first level. Once you 
    kill all those, find the next down ramp, but be careful: you will trigger a 
    Virindi attack. After you kill off those V's and drudges, find your way down 
    to the 3rd level, with Shadows.<br>
    <br>
    We're too tired to keep playing so we're taking a break. We're logged off 
    inside the 3rd dungeon. In the morning we'll send in more info.</font></span><p>
