<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Talira Dain tells 
you, &quot;Maybe you have heard of my husband, Gareth Dain?&quot;<br>
<br>
Talira Dain tells you, &quot;He hunted these lands looking for treasure and glory, 
but three years ago he failed to return home. I could find nothing else to 
explain his disappearance, then one year ago a warrior told me that he had seen 
Gareth shortly before he went missing. The man said that Gareth had been 
fighting a group of Sclavus in the crater hills somewhere around here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talira Dain tells you, &quot;I moved to Candeth Keep with the hope that I could find 
clues to tell me what had happened to Gareth. Recently my husband's dear friend 
Dalius found a Temple in a crater west of here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talira Dain tells you, &quot;He says that the crater was filled with a howling 
sandstorm. He bravely fought his way to the eye of the storm to find a Temple 
protected by Sclavus. I am sure that this must be the same temple that my 
husband was last seen at.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talira Dain tells you, &quot;Please, go and find out what happened to my husband. I 
just need to know what really happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalius Kendmar tells you, &quot;Hello friend, did Lady Dain ask you to speak with 
me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalius Kendmar tells you, &quot;I must ask a favor of you. I recently discovered 
something while searching for my long lost friend Gareth Dain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalius Kendmar tells you, &quot;I was exploring the wastelands west of here when a 
giant sandstorm blew in out of nowhere. It stung my face and made it almost 
impossible to breathe, but I forced my way onward. I eventually came to a calm 
at the center of the storm where I found an ancient temple. When I approached 
the structure a great number of Sclavus sprung from the sands and attacked, 
forcing me to retreat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalius Kendmar tells you, &quot;I have told Lady Dain what I discovered and we 
believe that this is the very Sclavus Temple that Gareth was last seen at. I do 
not however hold her belief that her husband still lives. She has obsessed over 
his disappearance for three years now and I dearly wish to see her mourning 
end.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dalius Kendmar tells you, &quot;Do her a noble deed and find proof of her husband's 
death. I am sure that my friend Gareth would have come back if humanly possible, 
so I know him to be dead. I ask of you to be sure that you bring only proof of 
his death, she has suffered enough and I could not bear to see her suffering 
continue. Do this for me and I will reward you.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Maggie<br>
<br>
Here's a little walkthrough for the Gareth Dain Quest. First of all talk to 
Talira in Candeth keep, he asks you to search for his husband, that was last 
seen west of the city. </font></p>

<br>
Go to the sclavus temple (82.5S 75W), and enter the dungeon. Take the path 
directly in front of you down to thh next level. Clear the sclavus form the room 
and find a passage down . From there, take the left hand passage and proceed 
through some rooms filled with sclavus. In the 3rd or 4th room you'll notice 
there is a path to your left, take it and meet the strange sclavus. Talking to 
him, he'll ask you to leave him alone. Here you seem to have a choice, kill him 
or not. I chose to kill him (nothing in his corpse).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You allow 
Strange Sclavus to examine your Scrap of Paper.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;Open what?&quot;<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;We can't let you leave you 
know. She wouldn't be happy with ussss.&quot;<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;Don't look at me. I am hideoussss!&quot;<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;I can no longer cry for what I have lost. My sorrow 
knows no release.&quot;<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;We can't let you leave you know. She wouldn't be 
happy with ussss.&quot;<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;We can't let you leave you know. She wouldn't be

Strange Sclavus shakes it's head and stares through you.<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;I have to hide. I mustn't be ssseen.&quot;<br>
Strange Sclavus tells you, &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;<br>

Strange Sclavus falls. It hisses with its final breath, &quot;Tell my wife I love her 
very much.&quot; </font><br>
<br>
Proceed off the path you were on, continuing down passed two doors, until you 
reach a room with Falatacot giant stone heads. In the next room over (passed a 
door with diff 325 after vagabond gift, there is another large room. On your 
left is another passage, with a door of 450 diff after vagabond's gift. Get 
through it, clear the area of sclavus (important), and then attack the 
sarcophagus at the end (vulnerable to fire). when destroyed, it'll spawn a 
Falatacot plus a full respawn of the room. On the Falatacot is a scrap of paper, 
with a single word, &quot;Akri&quot;<br>
<br>
Go back to the room next to the giant falatacot heads, and this time proceed 
straight. You'll eventually reach a surface portal, DON'T TAKE IT. Take the 
passage to the left, through another door (325 diff), and in a room with more 
sclavus and two useable torches that light the room. use them and continue, 
until you reach a room with 3 chomu sclavus lords and 4 sarcophagus. Kill the 
sclavus and then use all the torches in the room, and a passage will pop out. 
Follow the passage till you get to a room with a book inside it. Loot the book.<br>
<br>
Return to Candeth Keep, and let Talira read the book, she will ask you if you 
had vanquished whoever had turned her husband to a sclavus (that was the 
Falatacot Sister in the sarcophagus). If you did kill him, you'll receive the 
Polestar in return (pic enclosed)<br>
<br>
It seems there is another possible outcome to this quest, as Dalius is none too 
keen on the outcome of the events. Both NPC's reacted to the scrap of paper 
(before meeting the strange sclavus) indifferently (Dalius) or casting a war 
spell on you (Talila)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps<br>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
<br>
Just ran the Gareth Dain quest with a few people.&nbsp; Start by talking to Talira 
Dain and Dalius Kendmar in the northwest tower of Candeth Keep, then run to 
82.5s, 75.1w to the Sclavus Temple.&nbsp; Outside are regular and Lord Sclavi, fairly 
easy to pick through them and get to the portal inside.<br>
<br>
Once in the dungeon, you'll face exclusively Lord Sclavi of varying <br>
types.&nbsp; Make your way downward to the 2nd level, and there will be a small 
opening in one of the walls that leads downward into an area that looks EXACTLY 
like the Ancient Temple where the Living Tome is.&nbsp; At the bottom, you'll see a 
large room with a Sarcophagus at the opposite end.&nbsp; The Sarcophagus IDs as an 
item, but is attackable and debuffable.&nbsp; It has about 20,000 hp or so, but 
there's no real way to tell.&nbsp; Once it's killed, it spawns about 30 uber Sclavi 
and an undead Falatacot called Sister Vitriaka.&nbsp; Once you kill her, you can loot 
a Scrap of Paper from her corpse.&nbsp; The only thing on the paper is the work 'Akri'.<br>
<br>
There will also be a torch at the bottom of the stairs that opens a hidden door 
in the large room.&nbsp; Go through the door and down some spiral stairs and you'll 
find a small room with an unreadable text called Falatacot Tome, which you 
translate in Hebian-to.&nbsp; There's also a book called Book of Memories to be found 
behind another hidden passage in the halls before the big room with the 
Falatacot.<br>
<br>
When you go back to Candeth Keep, you can give the Book of Memories to Talira 
Dain for the <span lang="en-us">Polestar</span> -- OR -- you can give the translated version of 
the Falatacot Tome to Dalius Kendmar for the <span lang="en-us">Staff of 
Coercion.</span>&nbsp; Do not give the books to 
the wrong person, do not give them the Scrap of Paper, and do not try to get 
both items or the second attempt will result in them destroying the book you 
give them and calling you a liar.<br>
<br>
No idea yet what the Scrap of Paper is for.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

for the new quest this month, it was mentioned a couple times about needing to

<br>
To give more specifics on it, since the current writes contradict themselves.<br>
<br>
Upon entry of the room, it is the second torch on the right. *Important* you 
need to have the note from the Sister on you to be able to open it, as the word 
on the note is translated into &quot;open&quot;. If you don't have it on you, the torch 
will flare and suck away all your mana and stamina.<br>
<br>
You will know you are successful if you torch flares. The hidden door is on the
