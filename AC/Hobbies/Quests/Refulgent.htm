need information on the strange incidents occuring on the plateau.&quot; </font><br>

the Dark Vapor, a portal to the Caliginous Bethel dungeon spawns (restricted to

safe for buffing and on the floor you'll find a

When you're ready, head north into the main room and fight the hordes of 
Cultists, Cultist Cohorts and Cultist Priests. You'll also see our old friend 
Twitch, escaped from Aphus Lassel, but still caged. The guy just can't win!</span></font></p>

open door into the frost room.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your 
fire/lightning person should head to the next door while you wait at the cold 
room levers. Have them take the east passage to the bridge, them jump into the 
main Twitch room. Take the west passage from the room, then make an immediate 
right down the ramp. At the 4-way intersection, go south, then make a right at 
the &quot;T&quot; heading west. The door is at the top of the spiral staircase.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Pull the levers 
in the cold room, then join the rest of your party at the now open door. Enter

This button opens the door at the top of the eastern spiral staircase.</span><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Go through the eastern staircase door and find the button on 
the far east wall guarded by Summoned Pulsar Wisp. This button will open a 
hidden door to a secret passage!</span><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">To reach the hidden door head back to the &quot;T&quot; intersection 
between the two staircases and take the passage directly north. When you reach 
the wall, you should now pass through it. The halls will now be bright red.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Be cautious 
entering the room at the end of the passage! It's full of Cultist Priests and 
High Priests who will try to kill you! Watch your health; you'll be heavily 
attacked by war spells. Clear the room, then jump in the sacrificial pit in the center of 
the room. You'll land in a disgusting pile of bones and blood. On the floor you 
can also find </font></span>

the NW corner of the floor. Follow the corridor and jump down to the final 
Shadow level. Fight through the Umbris, Panumbris, Sinister and Tenebrous 
Shadows. You'll also be attacked from the corners with war spells, courtesy of 
Shadow Cysts --</span>shadows trapped in the wall (which you later discover to 
be shadows not quite completely formed yet).</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Look for the Lesser Void Knights

Yep, you heard it here first ... the shadows are back and they're kidnapping 
people and brainwashing them (cultists) while they are turned to the dark side.

Proselytic Shadow tells you, &quot;Where has the light gone? I cannot see. I was.. 
betrayed?&quot;<br>

Proselytic Shadow tells you, &quot;The dark one whispers to me now. He beckons me to 
avoid the light.&quot;<br>

Proselytic Shadow tells you, &quot;The darkness, so cold... so painful...&quot;<br>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To finish the 
quest head to Ithaenc Cathedral using Recall the Sanctuary (or purchase a 
Wedding Invitation if you do not have the spell). </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Find Adja's Well 
near the base of the Cathedral and use the bucket on the well to retrieve the

Ithaenc</a>. </font></span></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">You lower the bucket into the well and retrieve some 
of the cool, clear water.</font></p>

bucket to transform your bracelet!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">As the water from Adja's well 
cascades over the bracelet, it begins to shine anew!</font><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Note: Don't use the water on the bracelet or you will drink 
it instead and have to wait 24 hours to draw another draught!</span><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">When worn, the bracelet increases you health, stamina and 
mana by 15 points! (Not stackable with the Helm of Knorr of Bloodstone Jewel.)</span><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Finally, return to Aurten Rhell and show him your 
discoveries. Hand him the 2 journals and you'll receive a random reward.</span><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Aurten Rhell Bewren's Journal. </font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Fiction! Pure fiction! I could 
have written a more compelling tragedy. I do have to admit, even though this is 
surely a fake, you did put a fair amount of effort into it. If anything you 
entertained me with this garbage. Here, take this.&quot; <br>
Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;I know... I know... you at least tried to help me out. 
You really shouldn't be getting anything from me, but since I'm such a nice guy 
I'll make an exception for you.&quot; <br>
Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Cultists... Summoning and worshipping shadows... how 
ludicrous!&quot; </font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Aurten Rhell gives you Small Shard. </font><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Aurten Rhell Jaeget's Journal. </font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Some papers? While an interesting 
read I am sure, how am I to know if this is genuine and not some fiction you 
yourself devised? Very well, I suppose you deserve some reward even if these 
papers are fabricated.&quot; <br>
Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;You have a lot of nerve to deliver this garbage to me. 
But I am a man of my word. Here. This is for you, even though you don't deserve 
it.&quot; </font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Aurten Rhell gives you Virindi Singularity Key. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Other possible 
rewards:</span></font><br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Aurten Rhell gives you Pyreal Golem 
Heart.<br>
Aurten Rhell gives you Pyreal Bar.</font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">You can also 
exchange the Repugnant Bracelet for a Writ of Refuge (he will keep the 
bracelet). </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You give 
Aurten Rhell Repugnant Bracelet.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;So many people have brought me 
pieces of parchment with melodrama scrawled upon it. One person even brought me 
a strange stick, whatever that is for, but this... finally! Solid evidence of 
wrong doing on the plateau!&quot;<br>
Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Wait... what was I getting so excited over? This is 
just some amulet caked in carenzi refuse. Hardly proof of anything. You know 
what? I am so tired of people bringing me dead ends and fallacies! Here! Just 
take this!&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Aurten hastily pulls a writ from his backpack and throws 
it at you.<br>
Aurten Rhell gives you Writ of Refuge.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Aurten Rhell tells you, &quot;Just because you haven't been 
helpful doesn't mean I won't reward you for the effort. Maybe next time you'll 
bring me something worthwhile!&quot;</font></font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
<br>
</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you try and give him 
the finished Refulgent Bracelet, he won't know what to do with it. However, next 
time you're through the dungeon, hand it to the Proselytic Shadow!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">The shadow flinches 
as the shining bangle approaches his wrist. He attempts to accept the gift, but 
his skin ripples and warps to avoid the sparkling adornment.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
