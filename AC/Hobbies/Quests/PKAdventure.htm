    so that Danier could practice some of his new Level VII spells, Ned
    Cleversun and I went PK! We made our preparations, muling our favorite
    items, just in case. I hauled out some old Celdon Leggings and my old Gold
    Coat, and Ned found an old green helmet to wear. After stopping by a
    convenient lifestone, we met up with Danier in Glendon Wood and headed out,
    our hearts light with blood-thirst and mayhem!</small></font></p>

    As he knelt before the altar, freeing himself from Asheron's protective
    magics and becoming one of Bael'Zharon's chosen, a demon, with hands full of
    fire, unfurled itself and spread its wings wide. Ned screamed like a girl.

    had dropped Blood Loather on his beloved composite bow and he was dead set

    4,000 points?? I became bitterly depressed. Doogen said I shouldn't fret.
    It's a very respectable number, comparable to an Olthoi Worker, even! These
    small attempts to cheer me could do nothing to lessen the heaviness on my
    spirit. Was I really worth so little? Fueled by raging fury and anguish, I
    took out my distress on Danier, who was lying helpless on the ground nearby,
    my mighty sword slashing through the air towards his prone figure.</font><center>

Proper Attitude!</b></font></center><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">All
    in all, it was good to be a killer. I shared my joy with Veritus Venatus who
    gave me a few pointers in D00d Sp34K for future reference!&nbsp;</font><center>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="PK/VerbalInfection.JPG" width="475" height="61"></center><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I
    adjusted my attitude.</font><center>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="PK/Anyway.JPG" width="475" height="63"></center><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Since
    it was getting very late, we decided we had better head over to Trothyr's
    Rest to finish waiting out our 3 hours. We had a few moments of awkwardness
    as we fought our way through. We kept accidentally targeting each other,
    instead of the monsters! Danier showed up a spot at the top
    of a set of stairs where we could wait in relative safety.&nbsp; I used some
    of my time doing spell research, trying to Master Recall the Sanctuary
    (where another Altar of Asheron resides).&nbsp;</font><center>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="PK/Asheron.JPG" width="250" height="250"><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><br>
Was It All Just A Dream?</b></font></center><p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Coincidentally,
    news of a upcoming rollback reached our ears not too long after our night of
    killing. We did a little math, and figured out that the rollback would occur
    some time right in the middle of our PK adventure. We waited in
    anticipation! Secretly, I was hoping that the rollback would place us smack
    dab in the middle of our PK battle. Right at the time where I had killed Ned
    Cleversun, but he had not yet killed me! Bwahahaha! Or maybe we'd find out
    that we had not even gotten started. Had it all been just a dream? Or, worst
    of all, would Ned Cleversun have to sit out his grueling 3 hours for a 2nd
    time? You'll be glad to know that the rollback placed us right at the very
    tail end of our PK time. Our 3 hours had already expired and I was standing
    safely at the top of the stairs, right where they had left me! Would we do
    it again? You bet! Except next time... I'm bringing a Hollow Sword! ;-)</font></td>
