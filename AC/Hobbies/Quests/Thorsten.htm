      <br>
      Years ago my older sister disappeared. She had been a girlhood friend of 
      Elysa Starthelar and corresponded with her quite often. I believe the 
      letters Elysa wrote to her are a clue to her whereabouts. I would reward 
      you if you could aid me in this matter. You may find me in the town of 
      Cragstone and I will provide you with the details.<br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Glysander Cartoth tells you, &quot;Hello, I hope that you 
      are here to help me! My name is Glysander Cartoth. I seek to recover a 
      series of letters that Elysa Strathelar wrote to my older sister, Lania 
      Cartoth. They were friends from childhood on Ispar and they corresponded 
      for some time here in Dereth. One day my sister disappeared. I believe the 
      letters may hold a clue to her disappearance. I will reward you with 
      Experience Points for every letter you bring me. Furthermore, my sister 
      once said something to me that leads me to believe the letters may direct 
      you to items of great worth: Thorsten<br>
      Cragstone's Armor or his axe! I know not whether these items are truly 
      attainable but...&quot;</font><br>

      Brontynn Marshad, who promised to try to track down the letters but I have 
      not heard from him in some time. He was staying in a cottage south of 
      Eastham, near the beach. There is a chest in the cottage inside which he 
      said he would leave letters for me to pick up periodically. I give you the 
      key to the chest, for I am unable to make this journey. Please see if 
      there are letters in the chest and give Brontynn this note, should you 
      find him. This note authorizes Brontynn to give you any letters he may 
      have. Thank you, and best of luck!&quot;</font><br>

    go to Tou-Tou and seek out a man named Tai Wo. He has a copy of the same 
    letter Lia Tze has and may have knowledge of how to obtain a replica of 
    Thorsten Cragstone's Axe. But beware- do not go to both of these people, for 
    there is bad blood between them! Choose only one of them, for they will not
