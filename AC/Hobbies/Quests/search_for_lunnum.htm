	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hey Maggie, we discovered the next phase of 
	the Lunnum quest, here is a <br>
	write up. Attached also are some pictures.<br>
	<br>
	Credit goes to Zegeger of HG, Athenna of HG, and Daggerwood of HG<br>
	<br>
	Search for Lunnum<br>
	<br>
	You must have completed the Theif of Lunnum quest to begin this quest. If 
	Fiun Layeel does not say what it says below that means you need to do 
	Lunnum's Pyre and Theif of Lunnum again before you can start.<br>
	<br>
	Start by talking to Fiun Layeel at the Fiun Outpost.<br>
	<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;It is good that you have come. New information has 
	come to light regarding Lunnum's disappearance. I never believed that the 
	Viamontian Hunter Andrilos took Lunnum. There were too many inconsistencies 
	when your investigation was made.&quot;<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;Why would he leave such an obvious trail back to his 
	home? What did he have to gain by taking Lunnum? These questions have 
	bothered be for some time.&quot;<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;Awhile ago Nuhmudira visited the Fiun Outpost and 
	spoke to our leaders about exchanging magical secrets for our taboo magics 
	of Creature Creation. The leaders refused for obvious reasons. We will not 
	let the same mistakes we made on our home world be repeated here on this 
	one.&quot;<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;When I remembered her visit I also remembered how 
	adamant she had been about acquiring the taboo magics. I believe she would 
	have threatened us if she had thought it would do any good.&quot;Fiun Layeel 
	tells you, &quot;I would like you to search Nuhmudira's Wharehouse and see if you 
	can turn up any new clues.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Head to Nuhmudira's Mansion (4.0S, 35.9E). The quickest way is from the 
	Devana Portal (2.2N, 50.3E) near Lytelthorpe.<br>
	Head down into the dungeon and find a portal disguised as a bookcase. Use 
	the bookcase and you'll appear in a new dungeon with Sclavus Lords and 
	Storage crates. Attack the crates to break them open until you find &quot;Blue 
	Face Paint Recipe&quot;. (8 hour timer on the pickup)<br>
	<br>
	Head back to Fiun Layeel and hand him the Recipe.<br>
	<br>
	You give Fiun Layeel Blue Face Paint Recipe.<br>
	Layeel takes the recipe and reads it.<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;This isn't enough to directly tie Nuhmudira to the 
	theft of Lunnum, but I may be able to use this to scry for places this note 
	has been.&quot;<br>
	Layeel holds the recipe to his chest and slowly turns around chanting 
	something unintelligible beneath his breath. His eyes grow hazy and 
	unfocused and he slows to a stop facing east.<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;I have scryed a strong connection to a place located 
	in the eastern end of the Osteth Mountain Range. Travel to 84.3N 24.7E and 
	seek out what lies there.&quot;<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;I have one more favor to ask of you. If you find 
	that Lunnum's corpse has been desecrated in any way I would have you destroy 
	it rather than see it returned to Fiun Gaya in such a state. Better that he 
	never sees such a sight.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Now head for the Temple Entrance (84.3N 24.7E), level 120+. The quickest way 
	is from the the Dagger Vale Portal (32.9N, 59.6E) near Arwic. Inside you'll 
	find Sclavus Lords or higher.<br>
	<br>
	Head into the big room and then west. You will go down and then follow a 
	long linear path. After some time you will enter a large room with a level 
	161 undead called Patrician Phaerix. He has a huge amount of health. He 
	seemed to be most vulnerable to fire, and casts lots of vulns so watch out 
	when the sclavus in the room respawn.<br>
	<br>
	Once you kill him, loot the key and open the door, there is a lever behind 
	it which opens the two gates. Head through either, if you enter the left 
	one, you need to throw another lever to enter the next room. Note this small 
	room is a safe place to rebuff before continuing. In the next room is 
	Patrician Kilkitris who also is a level 161 undead and also has a huge 
	amount of health. Once again fire seemed best and watch out for the Scalavus 
	respawn.<br>
	<br>
	Once you kill him, loot the key, open the door, and hit the switch inside. 
	It will open the closest gate and the next gate as well. Head quickly down 
	that path as the gate only remains open a short time. You will come into a 
	large room with very high level sclavus and Lunnum, a level 185 Fiun. She 
	has 200k health and casts some nasty debuffs which can halve your skills and 
	vitals . Fire seemed to work well on her. After killing her, Lunnum drops 
	many Ritual Chest Keys (27 day timer). Each person should loot one and then 
	head to the next room to loot Lunnum's Chest. It contains a Black Skull of 
	Xikma (add Undead slayer to a weapon), a Fiun Crown, and some loot.<br>
	<br>
	After everyone has looted, head back to Fiun Layeel and talk to him. He 
	rewards you with a good amount of xp, It appears to be 15% of your level, 
	capping at 100m.<br>
	<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;It is a shame what became of Lunnum. Thank you for 
	your help in uncovering the truth of her disappearance.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 72,091,263 experience.<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;I wish that you had not killed that innocent man 
	Andrilos. May you take this as a lesson that people should not be judged 
	without a sound body of evidence. Vigilantism is blood thirst masquerading 
	as justice.&quot;<br>
	Fiun Layeel tells you, &quot;Say nothing of our investigation to Gaya. We all 
	miss Lunnum, but Gaya's morbid obsession has cost us too much and it ends 
	here.<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for a great site!<br>
