    Micon Stuvis the Barkeep tells you, &quot;Come back whenever you have the time, 
    traveler. I'm always up for a bit of gossip. Why, even now Bachus Flufens 
    will tell me quite the tall tale about some Tumerok warrior and his &quot;living&quot; 
    spear... I'm glad she came to stay with me here in Redspire - I was afraid 
    for her safety out there by the western shore.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Head upstairs to speak to 
    Bachus Flufens. She'll tell you more and give you a copy of her journal.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">
    Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;Woe is me! The Hea must have overheard that I 
    have been sending travelers to investigate their caverns, for they invaded 
    my house, burned down my apple trees, and ate my bunny rabbits! I barely 
    escaped here to safety of Redspire in one piece! Fortunately my dear friend 
    Micon has agreed to give me shelter until I am back upon my feet.&quot;<br>
    Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;They must hold that relic in high esteem indeed. 
    A most fanciful folk, I must say! I heard that it is a legendary spear that 
    they dismantled and enshrined in two separate caverns on the island. It once 
    belonged to a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to 
    persuade them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. 
    Somehow they dispatched him but retained his spear...which is supposed to 
    have some sort of magical, &quot;living&quot; properties to it. I'm not quite sure 
    what to believe.&quot;<br>
    Bachus Flufens tells you, &quot;Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns 
    to the northwest along the shore. Try the area around 40.2N 84.7W --at least 
    that's where I saw the Tumeroks heading last. Beware, friend--it's quite 
    likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must catch up on my journal 
    today. If you would like to read it, here are a few pages that I wrote the 
    other day.&quot;</font><br>

    <p><span lang="en-us">Below are notes from the original quest, presented for 
    historical reference.<br>
    </span></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"><br>
	</span>A report from
      Grimshaw aka Arabin:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> A quest for a new spear!&nbsp;I spoke to Lark Grifanna the Barkeep in ... who had the following&nbsp; to say.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">
      "Take care as you travel in this area. Bachus tells me that the Tumeroks&nbsp;<br>
      seem to be engaged in some strange feud, and it'd probably be best&nbsp;<br>
      if you didn't get yourself tangled up in it."<br>
      "These are interesting times indeed...if only Brachus were here to embroider a pretty tale for us! Too bad she's off on another wild
      goose chase again -- tracking down a spear, she says. She might be down by the western shore... that's where her house is, in any case."</font><br>
      <br>
      I continued making my way from town to town and spoke with Micon Stuvis the Barkeep in Redspire. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
      <font color="#FFFF99">"With all the adventurers coming through Redspire, I've certainly&nbsp;
      heard a lot of interesting tales."<br>
      "Come back whenever you have the time, traveler. I'm always up for&nbsp;a bit of gossip. Why, even the other day
      Bachus Flufens, came by&nbsp;and told me quite the tall tale about some Tumerok
      Warrior and his&nbsp;'living' spear... I know I should have cut her off sooner, but
      you&nbsp;know... she probably doesn't have too many amusements over there&nbsp;on the western shore..."</font><br>
      <br>
      I headed out towards the western shore to find this teller of tall&nbsp;tales. I finally found her house at 43.5N<span lang="en-us">,</span> 85.4W and took a look around.
      She keeps some baby rabbits in a cage out front which are so cute. Anyway, she
      answered the door and had the following to say:<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#FFFF99">
      "A visitor! I do not often get many visitors to my modest homestead. Did Micon or Lark tell you that I've been
      spending time with the&nbsp; Tumeroks? A most fanciful folk, I must say! Why,
      just the other day&nbsp; one of the Hea told me about a legendary spear they
      dismantled and&nbsp; enshrined in two separate parts of the island. It once
      belonged to&nbsp; a warrior from an opposite faction, I believe. He tried to persuade&nbsp;
      them back to traditional ways, but they would have none of it. Somehow&nbsp;
      they dispatched him but retained his spear... which is supposed to&nbsp; have some sort of magical, 'living' properties to it. I'm not quite&nbsp;
      sure what to believe."<br>
      "Perhaps the answer could be found in the caverns to the northwest&nbsp; along the shore. Try the area around 44 North, 87 West -- at least&nbsp;
      that's where I saw my new Tumerok aquaintances heading last. Beware, friend -- it sounds as if they held this artifact in high esteem,
      and it's quite likely to be well guarded. I'd go myself, but I must&nbsp;<br>
      catch up on my journal today."</font><br>
      <br>
      I headed to the coordinates she gave and soon reached a dungeon called&nbsp;Tumerok Cavern. Unfortunately it is restricted to levels 5-20. Time&nbsp;to get my level 18 character. In he steps and dies twice. The end&nbsp;guy is really tough. The easiest way to guide you through the quest&nbsp;is to tell you step by step which way to go. Sorry, I'm not good&nbsp;<br>
      at mapmaking :)<br>
      <br>
      Step 1 - You enter into a large room, usualy clear. Head west down&nbsp;stairs.<br>
      Step 2 - Turn left and down more stairs.<br>
      Step 3 - Turn right at the junction halfway down the stairs. Watch&nbsp;<br>
      out for Jibrit Zephers here.<br>
      Step 4 - Then Left at the next junction and go through the door.&nbsp;<br>
      Step 5 - Exit through the only other door and follow the passage&nbsp;to the left.&nbsp;<br>
      Step 6 - If you stayed left you will shortly come to stairs leading&nbsp;down. This is where is gets tough. Down
      these steps you can turn&nbsp;left or right. Both lead to the same room but I'd recommend turning&nbsp;right. There are a couple of Hea Hunters (Level 15) in the corridor.
      When you reach the metal door (one at end of each passage) get ready. If you are alone like I was the only choice is to draw things out&nbsp;and fight them a couple at a time. In this room there are 9 Hea Hunters&nbsp;(Level 15), 2 Veteran Reedsharks (Level 12), and the Hea Warrior&nbsp;(Level 23) who has the key. The warrior is 9 levels lower than the&nbsp;ones you fight on the surface but I found him to be much tougher.
      <br>
      Step 7 - You will find a key on him called Tumerok Vault Key. Use&nbsp;this on the vault at the back on the cavern. You watch a cool animation&nbsp;as it unlocks and inside you find the
      Tumerok Spear. This spear is&nbsp;non-tradeable which is extremely annoying. I'm hoping that I can&nbsp;place it in my house chest when I get one after giving both my characters&nbsp;<br>
      permissions to it. Also, the quest has a timer on it. I don't know&nbsp;how long that is yet though :)<br>
      <br>
      I'll let you know when I find the other part of this quest if there&nbsp;is a head or something to be attached...<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, keep up the fantastic work on your website and I'll keep&nbsp;looking for more information for you.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">SPEAR QUEST CONTINUED<br>
      A friendly gentleman by the name of Ogma (aka Lugh) met with me near
      Redspire and mentioned that he'd heard my tale of the spear thus far. In
      addition to this though, he believed he had found the location for the
      other part of the spear. We set out together to take on the dungeon which
      is called Tumerok Cave and is located at 43.6N, 84W.<br>
      <br>
      This is the route inside the dungeon you will need to take:<br>
      <br>
      You appear inside the dungeon in a tiny safe room. Go out the door into
      the main room and you will notice it is very similar to the entrance room
      on the other dungeon. Head out the South door and follow the passage round
      to the right. Go down the stairs and you will find yourself in an
      &quot;L&quot; shaped room. Follow the room round and take the exit on the
      North wall. Down some more stairs.<br>
      <br>
      Now it gets tricky. This level is a maze. Take a right at the bottom of
      the stairs. Next junction take a left and go through door. Leave the room
      by the door in the left (east) wall. Head east until you see a door on
      your left. Go through it and you'll be in a big room with a couple of
      trees. At this point you start fighting Hea Hunters as well.<br>
      <br>
      Leave the room through the North door and take a right. Take the door on
      the left. Leave the room by the other door and head left. Go past the door
      on the right and enter the door straight ahead.<br>
      Take the right door. Go past another door and enter the left door. Leave
      via the right door and go straight through the next room (2 doors). Head
      left and you will see an exit on the right. Take the door opposite the
      exit, on your left.<br>
      <br>
      Go down. Go through the first metal door. Take a right and stick to the
      right wall. You will fight through 4 Tidal Siraluun's. When you come to
      the next metal door rebuff if you need to. This leads into a large cavern
      where you will find 4 Veteran Reedsharks, 4 Hea Drumspeakers, and a Hea
      Shaman (Level 23). If you are soloing then pull them and pick them off a
      couple at a time.<br>
      <br>
      After smiting the shaman, I found a key on him which I grabbed before
      searching the cavern some more. Right at the back of the cavern I
      discovered a second Vault. This one displaying a symbol of a figurine
      instead of a spear.<br>
      <br>
      I used the key and discovered the figurine inside. I pulled out my spear
      and joined the two of them. As I did so, the eyes on the figurine opened
      up and stared straight at me. I knew, I was the proud owner of Aun Tanua's
      War Taiaha!<br>
