		of LC reports:<br>
		I would advise using a full fellow, minimum of 140+, and that everyone 
		should double-buff before starting this, for dispel all traps. Note also 
		that, though you may not pick up items again if your timer isn’t up, you 
		may still enter all portals.<br>
		<br>
		To start, run to Bandit Castle. (Take the Eotensfang portal from the 
		Arwic settlement portal ring at 41.0N, 60.7E) and run to the Bandit 
		Castle portal at 42,4N, 60.5E. In the castle you will find Kiriel 
		Shadowborn.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Thank you for 
		coming. I feared many would not be willing to hear me out.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Grael has awakened. My lord tried to stop 
		this, but it has come to pass. I fear the Black Spear's rage will 
		consume this world, if he is not stopped. To that end, my Lord has sent 
		me to aid you and all those who go with you.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;First, a little lesson in history...&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Long ago, Grael, the Black Spear of the 
		Kemeroi, chose to sleep. The place he chose to sleep was an isle north 
		of here, north of Vissidal Isle. His presence covered the island in 
		Shadow, and the isle soon came to be called the Dark Isle.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Those Falatacot who followed the Old One, 
		N'cthail took a chance and used ancient seals to sink the isle below the 
		waves. It was their hope that none would ever wake Grael and that this 
		world would be free of him forever. Now, however, that wish has been 
		undone by another.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;I have been shown the path to this temple. 
		If the ancient stories are true, there should be a crystal in this 
		temple to which the ancient seals are bound. The temple is heavily 
		defended. There are wards that block the use of the portals to the 
		catacombs. I've located a tablet that will allow me to enchant you to 
		bypass the Eastern Temple Catacomb's wards. Go into the Temple. There is 
		a portal to the Temple opened at 70.4N, 50.5E. Find the entrance to the 
		Eastern Catacombs, bring back anything you find that may aid us 
		further.&quot;</font><br>
		<br>
		This will flag you for the Eastern Catacombs dungeon. Have your group 
		run to 70.4N, 50.5E, the Temple of N’cthail. Upon entering, you will be 
		on some secluded island with hundreds of hecatomb-flinging, draining 
		tendrils. At the top of the Falatacot-type temple is the Vault of 
		Eternal Slumber. Have you group go along the side to the Eastern 
		Catacombs portal. Do not stop. You may not enter the other dungeons 
		until you have completed the prior ones. Once everyone is downloaded in 
		the Eastern, be prepared for lots of running. It would be wise to kill 
		everything as you go, so that a person does not lag out and die on the 
		way down. You will be fighting Falatacot Abbesses, Enraged Ancient 
		Souls, and Imperial Consort Falatacot, in 1-2 groups most of the time.<br>
		<br>
		This dungeon is all lefts, EXCEPT for where ramps conjoin into one 
		level. You’ll always follow that rule (And truth be told, you will use 
		this same concept on the other 2 dungeons). Beware! You will find that 
		at the top of every ramp is a dispel-all trap. This will either dispel 
		some of your buffs, or ALL of your buffs. Sometimes you will enter from 
		the top and may not see the ramp, so make sure that as you see signs of 
		a ramp, tell your group to stop and do a full jump to the edge of the 
		ramp. This only applies when there is a junction of another ramp. At 
		some level strip, you will encounter stam drain-alls and 1 other 
		dispel-all trap. You may choose to rebuff at this hidden dispel trap. As 
		you keep literally hugging the left wall, you will see something 
		different and go downward. At the bottom is a Lightning Trap and some 
		undead. Keep going all lefts, and you will eventually find yourself in a 
		room with more tendrils and the Mistress of the East. She has major ADD 
		and will continually walk back to her spawn point so tendrils can drain 
		you. She will drop a key that opens the Eastern Vault behind her. Open 
		this. (If someone has died thus far, wait on the other side of the vault 
		and open the door when they come back.) Inside the vault are 3 Eastern 
		Temple Tablets, respawning every 15 seconds, on a 27 day timer. Portal 
		Recall back to Bandit Castle and hand it to Kiriel Shadowborn.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Kiriel Shadowborn Eastern Temple Tablet.</font><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Ahh, this should 
		help...&quot;</font><br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Kiriel Nightborn examines the tablet, muttering 
		over the runes while tracing them with a finger. A cold darkness slowly 
		covers the runes.</font><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Beautiful. Not 
		everything I need to gain you access to the crystal, but it points to 
		the remainder of the information. There is a second tablet in the 
		Western Catacombs. It contains the rest of the enchantment I need to 
		gain you access to the crystal. Enter the Western Catacombs, find the 
		tablet hidden there.&quot;</font><br>
		<font color="#66FF99">Kiriel Shadowborn intones softly and a cold chill 
		passes over you for a moment.</font><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;There, now you can 
		enter the Western Catacombs. Good luck.&quot;</font><br>
		<br>
		Now having been flagged for the Western Catacombs, run back to the 
		Temple of N’cthail and go in the west portal. <br>
		<br>
		You and your party will portal into a 4-way intersection facing north. 
		Go north BUT stop as soon as you see a ledge. About 8 feet in front of 
		the ledge is a dispel-all trap, so I would advise you to do a half jump 
		down into the pit of tendrils. (This dungeon is centered on levers, 
		buttons, and a pressure plate to open doors.) Once in the pit, get a 
		designated lever-puller and have him pull the lever to the south. This 
		will open the north door. A lever inside opens the west door, a lever in 
		that opens the east door, and finally in the east. Have someone block 
		the doorway in the east and once everyone is through, begin moving 
		downward. Take a left downward. After 2 ramps going down and several 
		rooms, you will find yourself running through a tunnel in the shape of a 
		circle and a 4-way center. DO NOT go in the center. It’s a dispel trap. 
		Have your party go around the circle and positioned at the north door. 
		Your lever puller should run back 2 rooms and will find a button on a 
		wall. This opens the east door. The lever in there opens the west door 
		and the lever in the west opens the north door. At some points you will 
		run into tendrils blocking the path. Get your melees back and get the 
		mages to wall them to death. The next rooms that contain doors are very 
		similar. Have your group line up at the west door as your lever-puller 
		runs back a previous room to push a button, which will open the south 
		door/lever, which will open the north door/lever, which will open the 
		east door/lever, which will open the west door/lever. Get your group 
		through save for one person to hold the door. The lever puller should 
		not proceed to an empty west room next to the door. In the center is a 
		pressure plate, which opens another door past the west door. Once 
		everyone is through those 2 doors, jump into the pit, and head north. At 
		this split, take a left. Immediately after, take a right and head down 
		the ramps. You will find some tendrils. Wall them. At the end is ADD 
		Mistress #2. Kill her to loot her key, and open the Western Vault. Get 
		the Western Vault Tablet and return it to Kiriel Shadowborn.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;The second tablet. 
		Now we're getting somewhere&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Now, I'll be able to complete the 
		enchantment gaining you access to the Northern Catacombs. At the bottom 
		of the Northern Catacombs, you should find the gate to the crystal we 
		seek. Find it. Destroy it. Bring me proof of its demise, and I will 
		reward you.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;There, now you can enter the Northern 
		Catacombs. Good luck, and take care. The path only gets more difficult 
		from here.&quot;</font><br>
		<br>
		Great, you’re like 67% done with the quest! Take the North temple portal 
		around the back of the Temple of N’cthail this time. Take all lefts, 
		killing all tendrils and undead. Undead usually come in 3-4’s. Once you 
		have gone down a long ramp, go straight, pull the lever, which opens the 
		door to the east. Inside is a lever that opens the door to the west. 
		Have your group go through that one. Head on up and through this long 
		and boring pathway, taking all lefts when given, EXCEPT when two ramps 
		conjoin into one, like mentioned before. You will encounter many 
		hallways of tendrils to wall spell. At the end is a portal to the 
		Everlasting Slumber. Once you enter, if you die, you can just use the 
		portal on top of the Temple of N’cthail. <br>
		<br>
		You are at a 4-way facing south. Turn North and go straight to the 
		ledge. The Crystal is below, seemingly in a giant pit of acid. Do a 
		half-full jump straight, hitting the opposite wall. This will avoid the 
		dispel-all trap on the ledge below you. Kill the tendrils around, 
		avoiding the edge of the middle ledge. I give the devs credit on this, 
		as many were freaked out that BM3-type floating pedestals would require 
		skill, but it’s all an illusion. Jump into the pit of acid and you will 
		levitate on an invisible floor above it. NOTE: there are dispel traps in 
		the corners of the pit, so don’t try fighting it there. Leave it toward 
		the center or in the hallway.<br>
		<br>
		This crystal does not take much to kill anymore, and the best weapon 
		type seems to be pierce, though it still doesn’t hit for that much. You 
		can’t bane against the crystal, as it does hollow, can dispel the spells 
		on your weapon, as well as pwning you with its Galvanic Fury spells. 
		Once it dies, it sprays crystals all around the pit. Pick up a Crystal 
		Shard and give it to Kiriel Shadowborn for your reward.<br>
		<br>
		Reward- Seems to be 10% xp and a Helm of Isin Dule. <br>
		<br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Have you done it? I 
		can feel the power flowing around you. If you have proof of the 
		crystal's demise, please, hand it to me so that I may reward you.&quot;</font><br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You give Kiriel Shadowborn Crystal Shard.</font><br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;A shard of the 
		partially reformed Soul Crystal...&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;It is good that this crystal not be 
		allowed to fully reform. There is a chance, if the Falatacot and the 
		crystal were left alone for long enough, that they could re-sink the 
		Dark Isle, cutting us off from the opportunity we sought in its 
		raising.&quot;<br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;Tell Please, accept this humble reward for 
		your continued efforts to keep the Dark Isle above the waves.&quot;</font><br>
		<font color="#66FF99">You've earned 46,949,665 experience. </font><br>
		Kiriel Shadowborn gives you Helm of Isin Dule.<br>
		<font color="#FFFF99">Kiriel Shadowborn tells you, &quot;My Lord thanks you 
		for your aid. It should be some time before the crystal can fully 
		reform. If you were to return in about a month, I'd be happy to reward 
		you with another helm. Providing, of course, that you bring me proof of 
		the reforming crystal's demise.&quot;</font></font></span></p></td>
