    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before we start, I'm going to lay one ground rule.<br>
    <br>
    As with most major quest items, these have already
    elicited heated responses on both the Game Issues and AC Discussions 
    boards. I've digested a number of reasonable and well-considered posts, and 
    I've seen a few people who posted only to tell me that I suck.<br>
    <br>
    The former type of posts are both desired and encouraged. The latter... 
    well, you've a right to your opinion, but please keep it out of this thread. 
    If you post a well-considered analysis of the armor's merits vs. drawbacks 
    and why my reasoning is faulty, I'll appreciate it. If you post just to make 
    a personal attack, I'll ask a CoD mod delete your post from this thread.<br>
    <br>
    So. The ground rule is: let's all be professional. Usually this forum is. 
    Let's keep it that way.<br>
    <br>
    As some of you know, the Thau Plate grew out of a thread started by Sturm on 
    the &quot;old&quot; CoD Dev Board last December. The question was, &quot;what type of quest 
    item would be really useful to mages?&quot; The list I got could be boiled down 
    to the following.</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Items with very low Arcane (~50) and very high magic 
      skill reqs (~300), for use by the specialized peeps.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Items with War Magic skill 
      checks, for use by &quot;real&quot; mages. Prevailing theory holds that hybrids 
      don't usually take War. This also &quot;buffs&quot; War.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Orbs with unique Recall or Summon locations that use 
      all their mana with each use. I tried this with an item called the 
      Aerlinthe Cynosure. This was an orb that would allow its wielder to recall 
      to Aerlinthe. The problem is that spells attached to a wand/staff/orb can 
      only come in two flavors with our current tech. You can cast a spell on 
      someone else, or have an enchantment cast a spell on you when you wield 
      it. I tried it as an enchantment, but it broke PvP like Recall Gems do - 
      there was no casting delay. Instant escape. So that was nixed. The 
      Cynosure was pulled out of January at the last minute and reworked into 
      the Aerlinthe Recall scroll for February.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">More orbs, wands, and staves with unique, 
      unresearchable spells.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Orbs, wands, and staves that have normal spells, but 
      look unique (like the Healer's Heart in Ithaenc).</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Anything useful with low weight. Mages are perpetually 
      overburdened with comps. Burden was a woe mentioned again and again, and I 
      took it to heart.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Quest items with special Item spells that can lower 
      other magic items skill checks or Arcane difficulty. These would have to 
      be tightly controlled, for obvious reasons.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">One-time magic caster assembly quest like SoCS. One 
      final object for Item, War, Life, Creature. Final object skill checks its 
      school at high level.<br>
      Possible spell combinations include War Mastery 5 / Lightning Bolt 5, Life 
      Mastery 5 / Heal Other 5, Creature Mastery 5 / Magic Yield Other 5, Item 
      Mastery 5 / Portal Recall. These wand/staves would cast with a spellcraft 
      equal to a Level 6 spell.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">As above, but the final item provides &quot;Dispell All 
      Negative Other&quot; spell that sucks all 500 or so mana out of the thing.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">An SoCS style one-time quest that requires a player to 
      pick his buffs (like the the rubies on the axe).</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Smouldering / Sparking / Stinging / Shivering Orbs. 
      Converted Atlan stones that cast bolts and prots. For example, the 
      Smouldering Orb might cast Flame Bolt V and Fire Protection VI. I didn't 
      like this idea, because IMO the stones are already one of the most 
      overused/overcollected items in the game.<br>
      The &quot;Atlan Wand&quot; idea is very popular, though, so the concept may see 
      light one day in one form or another.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Mage armor, because aside from robes, most armor is too 
      heavy for mages.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Out of these, you can guess which one I found the most 
    intriguing. Now I'll go through the stats one by one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of the first decisions I made was that the Plate would 
    come in three pieces - girth, leggings, and coat. Unlike robes, in which one 
    piece covers just about everything, I wanted to construct a &quot;real&quot; suit of 
    armor, based on the model of postpatch Celdon GSA. Off the shelf robes, in 
    my mind, make it too simple for mages to equip themselves for tanking. One 
    set of item buffs can set you up to go toe-to-toe with Coral Golems. You can 
    tank just as well in with Thau Plate, but you have to do a little extra work 
    for it. The low / medium / high Nephol Golem test scheme grew out of the 
    three-piece decision.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Appearance:</b> <br>
    Nothing much to say here. I wanted it to look unique, I wanted to see a 
    <a target="_blank" href="Yalain.htm">
    Yalain Imperial Seal</a> (design based on
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.andreas.com/hokusai.html">Hokusai's painting &quot;The Wave&quot;</a>), and, 
    on a whim, I added the choice of three colors. In case the rumor is still 
    out there, the color of the Kindling Stone you use only<span lang="en-us"> 
    effects</span> the color of the resulting armor. The spells &amp;c. remain the 
    same between all the color variants.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Appraisal Resistance: 280</b><br>
    Short Description: An iridescent crystalline coat, covering the torso and 
    arms.<br>
    Long Description: A heavily enchanted crystalline coat, of the type once 
    worn into battle by the Exarchs of the Yalaini Order of Hieromancers. The 
    seal of the Yalaini Seaborne Empire is embossed on its chest.<br>
    <br>
    This is a rather poor example, but someone had posted that they appreciated 
    the &quot;extra lore&quot; you got from successfully appraising the Staff of the 
    Nomads. They thought it was &quot;Appraisal Skill love.&quot; Truthfully, the extra 
    lore on the Staff and the other Ithaenc quest items were because I'd written 
    inscriptions for the items that were too big to fit in the inscription box 
    (I'm a <span lang="en-us">garrulous</span> SOB). But it was a good stopgap 
    approach to the Appraisal problem, so I added &quot;extra lore&quot; in the long desc 
    strings for many of the Plate quest items. You might have noticed that the 
    emblem of the Hieromancers is only described in the long appraisal strings 
    of the KindlingStones, Strange Humming Crystal, Puzzle Box, &amp;c.<br>
    <br>
    Armor Level: 0<br>
    Protections:<br>
    Acid: 0.0<br>
    Fire: 0.0<br>
    Frost: 0.0<br>
    Lightning: 0.0<br>
    Bludgeon: 0.0<br>
    Pierce: 0.0<br>
    Slash: 0.0<br>
    <br>
    Here's where we start dipping into controversial territory.<br>
    <br>
    There were two main reasons I chose not to give the armor any base defenses. 
    The first was that this was supposed to be, well, mage armor. I wanted to 
    create an item that would be totally useless to non-mages. The only sure way 
    to do that is with spell activation requirements. Other than an 
    enchantment's &quot;You must have Skill X at Level Y&quot; check, there's no way to 
    limit an item's utility to members of a particular group.<br>
    <br>
    The second reason was the availability of Jesse's craft name stamping code. 
    This is, as he puts it, the &quot;Your name must be Billy to use this item's 
    magic&quot; feature. This nifty little trick makes any spell-based item useless 
    for twinking and almost valueless on the Ebay market. If you want it, you 
    have to earn it yourself - or buy a whole character. This also had the bonus 
    of allowing me to make the item dropable/giveable. Going somewhere the Thau 
    Plate will be useless (like the Chorizite mines)? Mule it and put something 
    else on.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Spells:</b><br>
    Hieromancer's Ward (adds 170 AL, can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    <br>
    The idea of stackable spells was first put forward by Jesse. It seemed like 
    a good idea for the Plate. A good piece of armor could be made great with 
    your r33+ magic ski11z. This left the problem of deciding on an AL for the 
    Ward. Again, I hearkened back to the use of Postpatch Celdon GSA as a guide.<br>
    <br>
    Greater Decay Durance (as Acid Bane 5, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Greater Consumption Durance (as Flame Bane 5, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Greater Stasis Durance (as Frost Bane 5, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Greater Stimulation Durance (as Lightning Bane 5, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Lesser Bludgeoning Durance (as Bludgeon Bane 2, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Lesser Piercing Durance (as Piercing Bane 2, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    Lesser Slashing Durance (as Slashing Bane 2, but can be &quot;stacked&quot; on)<br>
    <br>
    My first thought was to give the armor no defense at all against the &quot;melee&quot; 
    damage types - bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. The principle behind the 
    decision was that the armor was to be used by mages in combat against magic 
    creatures and characters. Melee was supposed to trump it.<br>
    <br>
    I'm really gunshy about trying to balance items for PvP - I've learned that 
    it's very difficult to avoid f**king things up badly. The problem is that 
    most of the time PvP balance requires an item to be less &quot;uber.&quot; If you can 
    tank Corals in a store-bought Faran, no one cares (except those who wish 
    they could too). If you can tank swordsmen in a Faran, there's a problem. I 
    wanted to make a cool, powerful item, so I was content to let it remain 
    fairly useless in PvP.<br>
    <br>
    Azeraphel emphatically said that if the armor had no defense against three 
    damage types, it was a POS he would never use. So I gave them 25% protection 
    &quot;lesser&quot; Durances. Hollow weapons trump that anyway. People have brought up 
    the fact that the armor is useless against hollow monsters. To which I say, 
    &quot;stay away from where the hollow monsters are, or wear different armor if 
    you go there.&quot; Hollow critters are always placed on fixed spawns. Mule the 
    Thau Plate and wear something else.<br>
    <br>
    I've seen some complaints about the poor base pierce/bludgeon/slash 
    protections. I expected some. But to be honest and fair with you, I'm not 
    inclined to give them any more than a cursory listen. Here's why.<br>
    <br>
    This armor is specifically for mages. It's designed with spell protections 
    you can cast &quot;over&quot; and enhance. You can give a piece Unparalled protection 
    in all four elements with level 5 banes. That's mighty. That's better than 
    postpatch GSA, which, being non-enchantable, grants Unparalleled in only one 
    element at the expense of having no protection in its opposite. Let's 
    compare PP Flame GSA to Thau Plate, both the base version and with Impen and 
    Banes of levels IV-VII (minus any favorable spell economy bonuses).</font></p>

    Check out that far right column! Boss. Each piece of armor was given one 
    additional spell.<br>
    <br>
    Magic Resistance 6 (Girth)<br>
    Strength 6 (Leggings)<br>
    Mana Conversion 6 (Coat)<br>
    <br>
    In Sturm's thread, someone had said, &quot;Anything with Mana Conversion is 
    good.&quot; Makes sense to me - mage armor should allow you to be a more 
    efficient mage. Strength spells are the perpetually reagent-burdened mage's 
    friend. When they get up in levels, many don't go anywhere without a piece 
    of Strength jewelry. That was an obvious enough choice. Magic Resistance 6 
    just seemed like a good idea. It fit the armor's concept of armor for a mage 
    to fight other mages in.<br>
    <br>
    Max Mana: 8000<br>
    Mana Rate: 1 every 2 seconds<br>
    <br>
    The concept underlying this was to have an item whose mana reserve would 
    last a long time, but required a lot for upkeep to balance that. There's 
    only one item in the game (Focusing Stone) with a higher max mana. I chose 
    8000 based on the cost (~50,000p) I wanted to be paid for the mana charges 
    necessary to gas up the armor. Then, I played with the burn rate until it 
    would churn through that amount in about ~4.5 hours. That's the average 
    length of a play session across player profiles - from the casual player's 
    two-hour kibbitzing session to the hardcore powerlever's eight hour shift. 
    The thought of people having to stop in mid-quest to recharge three pieces 
    of armor made me squirm. With long-lasting level VII Impen and Banes 
    available, I hoped downtime would be quite low.<br>
    <br>
    The problem is, while the endurance mark is good for mages, the refueling 
    cost I chose is far too high. Mages can't afford 132,000p worth of Mana 
    Charges a night in addition to their reagent upkeep. The long-lasting but 
    expensive recharge approach might be a good idea, but for a mage-specific 
    item, it's terrible. In the future, it may be attempted with items for 
    meleers, who aren't crippled by reagent or ammo resupply costs.<br>
    <br>
    Difficulty (Arcane Lore req): 50<br>
    <br>
    As noted in my list at the top, mages hate items with high Lore. They don't 
    like paying to train and develop it in addition to their other high-cost 
    skills. Makes perfect sense to me. In my mind, Lore has been recast as a 
    requirement for anything to a requirement for specifically melee and archer 
    items.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Encumbrance:</b><br>
    Mages hate encumbrance. I took the encumbrance of PPGSA, divided by two, and 
    rounded down. Simple as that.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Spell Checks:</b><br>
    Thau Plate must have War Magic skill of 270<br>
    Exarch Plate must have War Magic specialized<br>
    Must have character name (stamped when Kindling Stone is applied)<br>
    <br>
    I've been over my reasons for the character name check already. It's the 
    best anti-Ebay weapon we've ever had. Only those with the skill to make 
    their own piece of Thau Plate can use it. If you want to buy a set of Plate, 
    you've got to buy a whole character.<br>
    <br>
    My original plan was to make Thau Plate for specialized mages only. In the 
    first spec draft, there was no such thing as Exarch Plate. The thought of 
    making a spec-only quest came up against a lot of opposition. Charlie, one 
    of our p<span lang="en-us">ro</span>ducers, pointed out that it excluded all 
    but one or two of the high level mages he knew in the game. There's no sense 
    in taking a month to make a quest only a handful can use, and p1551ng 
    everyone else off. Adding a second tier of armor could be done quickly and 
    easily. Making it cue of the addition of a second Kindling Stone meant I 
    only had to add a few craft tables to what I'd already done, rather than 
    more items, new places for them, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    This did bring up the issue of how the Exarch Plate should be unique. I 
    didn't want to boost its existing spells - that would bring an outcry of 
    haves versus have-nots. Ditto if I gave it something truly and directly 
    useful to all mages, like a Wizard's Intellect (max mana boosting) spell. So 
    instead of improving it, I made it different. I lowered the encumbrance even 
    further, asked Huxter to give it some decorative frills, and gave it a few 
    additional spells. Leadership 5 was an obvious choice for something intended 
    to be officer's armor. Sprint 5 was an okay idea, but not spectacular.<br>
    <br>
    I was stumped for a third spell idea. Az suggested a spell that added &quot;a 
    stupid amount&quot; to you Assess Monster skill, &quot;more than a level seven would.&quot; 
    Story-wise, it would have made sense for this to be an Assess Person spell. 
    The Yalain did a lot of fighting against other Empyrean peoples, but not 
    much against golems and feral wildlife. From a game perspective, though, 
    adding such a spell was dumb. Assess Person is really only useful in PvP, 
    and the armor was useless in PvP thanks to hollow weapons. I went with Az's 
    idea.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Value: </b><br>
    I didn't want this to be another riskless item. Risk is vital. It's what 
    makes you sweat when you're fighting and crow when you win. However, it's 
    also what leaving you punching your monitor and screaming when you lose. 
    Thau Plate couldn't be something dropped as a matter of course. The armor 
    should be something you worry about, but not something you're always running 
    after.<br>
    <br>
    When I made the Staff of the Nomads, Jesse and I ended up haggling over its 
    value to get something dropped reasonably often, but could be protected by 
    Master Robes and other death items. We finally settled on 11,508. Thau Plate 
    was supposed to be more useful than that. I settled on 10,000 as the value 
    for the biggest piece, the coat, and worked my way down from there on 
    instinct. It looks to me, though, that the values are still a bit too high.<br>
    <br>
    The skill checks for the craft bonuses were simple to determine. I asked 
    around the office what mages of around level 70 had in War. The average 
    answer was 270. I added 40 to that to compensate for the anticipated effect 
    of War Mastery 7, and 310 became the check for making Thau Plate. I asked if 
    it was likely for non-specialized mages to get their War up to 300. 
    Consensus was no. So 340 became the check for Exarch. Now that isn't 
    foolproof - our craft system skill check stat sets the level of skill at 
    which you'd have a 50% chance of success. That goes up and down on a fixed 
    scale. So it's possible, though unlikely, to &quot;accidentally&quot; make Exa<span lang="en-us">r</span>ch 
    when you're trying to dekindle and recolor your Thau Plate. To be safe - 
    don't buff when dekindling. To be really safe, get yourself a War Inep from 
    a passing Creature Mage or D-Gol.<br>
    <br>
    The Hieromancer's Orb and Globe of Auberean were uncontroversial &quot;cool toys&quot; 
    I wanted to get in. They don't do anything special, but they look great, and 
    they're useful tools for any mage. No one can complain about the effects of 
    fashion on game balance. The Globe is, IMO, the best item in the game. It's 
    just neat. Huxter did a great job on it. Someday we'll put his full-detail 
    Mercator projection of Auberean on a wall somewhere in the game. It's 
    amazing - like looking at a satellite image (he actually photomanipulated a 
    compiled satellite image of Earth to fit the scheme of the continents). The 
    method we used to keep this &quot;easter egg&quot; item out of the hands of portal.dat 
    hackers was pretty cool too. The land masses only appear when you 
    palette-shift the item in the game's rendering engine.<br>
    <br>
    When stocking Hieromancers' Halls, I asked the office, &quot;What do high level 
    mages like to eat? What's easy for them to kill and hard for melee or 
    archers?&quot; The replies were pretty much unanimous. Umbris, Dires Banderlings, 
    and most golems. So that's what I used. There were some qualms from the team 
    about mages camping this dungeon full of &quot;SIK chests on legs.&quot; I've been 
    watching the flow of things in the Halls. So far, I've seen no camping, 
    plenty of corpses, and lots of people having fun. It's a hard fight, but 
    appropriately rewarding. That's a good thing in my book.<br>
    <br>
    The guardian spirit was an idea I'm particularly proud of. It has no 
    physics. Therefore, melee and archery cannot hit it. Ever. It also has a 
    slew of nasty spells for use against the non-mage: Leaden Feet 5, Exhaustion 
    5, Vulnerability 4, Clumsiness 4, Mace Ineptitude 4, Unarmed Combat 
    Ineptitude 4, Crossbow Ineptitude 4, Sword Ineptitude 4, Bow Ineptitude 4, 
    Staff Ineptitude 4, and Axe Ineptitude 4. The crowning touch of its 
    spellbook is Healing Ineptitude 6. Now melee can fully understand the pain 
    of a D-Gol casting Life Ineptitude 6. ^_^<br>
    <br>
    The wandering vendors (Spertat &amp;c.) were an idea that had been nibbling my 
    ear for a couple of months. Being able to wrap them into the quest was quite 
    satisfying. If you haven't noticed yet, I made them a good place to unload 
    your loot in the field. Although they only sell a one class of materials 
    (bow, smith, mage), they can all purchase damn near any type of item in the 
    game.<br>
    <br>
    What's going to change about Thau Plate next month? Well, first understand 
    that I, personally, can guarantee nothing. What's done is entirely subject 
    to the review and approval process. It's not just my decision, it's the 
    design team's and MS'. Here's what I'd like to do, though:<br>
    <br>
    The &quot;bludgeoning dagger&quot;<br>
    Bad news first. This was intended to be an unenchantable joke item. As you 
    probably know, it's enchantable, and with a buffed version, you can mow 
    through golems. Well, that's a bug, and it's going away. Dagger users having 
    access to a previously unavailable damage type upsets interclass balance. I 
    asked around to make sure the effects were really that bad. Maybe we could 
    maybe get by with lowering its damage variance and speed. Consensus was that 
    the effects were serious enough that that wouldn't be enough. The dagger 
    will be unenchantable next month - it's a high priority bug. In the 
    meantime, enjoy it.<br>
    <br>
    Max Mana of all pieces lowered to 2000, Mana Burn of all pieces lowered to 1 
    point every 8 seconds. This gives you the same 4.44 hour endurance, and is 
    much cheaper to refuel.<br>
    <br>
    Value of all Pieces lowered 20%.<br>
    Girth 2400<br>
    Leggings 4800<br>
    Coat 8000<br>
    <br>
    Current Vial of Organic Acid drop is 1% on Harrower Grievvers, 3% on Bane 
    Grievvers. This is far too rare. I'm pretty sure there will be no hindrance 
    to my changing this to 1% on Virulent Grievvers, 3% on Harrower Grievvers, 
    and 3% on Bane Grievvers.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, it's getting late. Since the T1 line is going down early tomorrow 
    morning, I wanted to get this out tonight. I promised I would earlier in the 
    week. This is the last quest I'll ever be do in AC. My thanks to everyone 
    who's enjoyed Frore, the SoCS, Aerlinthe, Xarabydun, Ithaenc and the Shard 
    of the Herald, and Thaumaturgic Plate.<br>
