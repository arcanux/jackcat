    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Kira 
    Sojini tells you, &quot;Hrmph! You look new. Too new. Your weapons look like that 
    belong out there.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Kira motions up. </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;Hmmm.&quot; <br>
    Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;Where does your loyalty lie? Well? Answer me. Oh 
    never mind. It doesn't matter now.&quot; <br>
    </font>
    <font color="#66FF99">Kira Sojini taps her brow and looks at you harshly. </font>
    <font color="#FFFF99"> <br>
    Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;You're not from here, that is obvious. But I'm 
    hoping that you have some understanding of the hardships that we have faced 
    and continue to face. But it's not like you had any yourself. Sure slaying 
    monsters is hard work, but have you ever been bereft of family and 
    friends...?&quot; <br>
    Kira Sojini tells you, &quot;Of course you have...I know. But listen, 
    Martine...he took care of us and was there for us when we needed him and now 
    he's gone. Blinded by rage and manipulated by Gaerlan. It's been hard on all 
    of us...Please, just leave me be.&quot; </font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Hey there friend. No doubt 
    you've tried the door and found that Martine has sequestered himself away in 
    there. I wish there was a way in. I've been told by Josef that there is a 
    way in. That Josef knows a lot.&quot; <br>
    Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Listen. Martine. He's not really a bad guy. He's 
    confused and that got a lot worse after that Gaerlan guy showed up and made 
    things worse. For a while it looked as though he was going to beat that 
    thing inside his head. But then that Gaerlan guy kept...reminding him and 
    telling him to seethe and grow into the anger.&quot; <br>
    </font>
    <font color="#66FF99">Hibdin Velos sighs.<br>
    </font>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;My companion Ambrosia thinks the only way to save 
    Martine is to make him remember his hate. I think it's the exact opposite. A 
    long time ago he was in love with his wife. He still has a love letter or 
    two in his room.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;If you can find that and 
    bring it to him, I know that he'd snap out of this and do the right thing by 
    all of us.&quot; <br>
    Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Of course, you should listen to Ambrosia some, she 
    has other ideas.&quot; </font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;So you came here looking for 
    Martine did you? Well...then that's good. You see the Master lies just 
    inside this room. Only problem is we can't get in by any conventional 
    means.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe shakes her head and clucks her tongue.
    </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Of course if you listen to 
    what Hibdin has to say the Master just needs to find his focus again. Ha!&quot;
    </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe lowers her voice to a whisper. </font>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Hibdin of course is just a 
    little crazy. He was a drunkard when Martine found him. Wasting his life at 
    the bottom of a bottle. What Martine needs is to remember his rage and 
    direct it back at Asheron. Elysa slighted him for that fossil. That thing 
    from a bygone age when the world was...&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Ambrosia Roe shivers and stares into space for a 
    moment. </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;I'm sorry. You should help 
    Martine. There is an entryway to his study around here somewhere. Go there 
    and find a tusker husk. He blew it up you see, with the power of his mind.&quot;
    <br>
    Ambrosia Roe tells you, &quot;Collect it, bring it to him and wait for the 
    fireworks as he gets prepared to go and kill the Old Man.&quot; </font></font>
    </span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">From the entrance, head left and you'll find 
    a portal to Martine's Study. When you enter the Study, you'll be at a 4-way intersection. 
    Take a right and you'll be In 
      Martine's Bedroom. Strange statues surround the bed and you'll find a Tusker Husk 
    spawning on the floor. Take the left passage and you'll find a with a love 
      letter to Melaney on the table. Straight ahead is the portal to Martine's 
    Throne Room. Take the it and give Martine one of the two items to signify 
    your choice.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Text:
    <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Melaney.htm">Letter to 
    Melaney</a></font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">You can choose to give 
    either the Tusker Husk or the Letter to Martine. The Husk fills him with 
    rage, and the letter makes him want to atone and perhaps see his wife again 
    one day.</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99">You 
    give Martine Tusker Husk. </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Martine tells you, &quot;What is this? Yes...&quot; <br>
    Martine's voice becomes tinny, altering between a deep human voice and 
    distant alien tin voice. <br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;I remember this time well. I was a puppet then, nothing 
    more than an untrained mind with an incomprehensible amount of power. 
    Untapped, raw...&quot; <br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;It was during this time, taken from my home, stripped of 
    the woman and child that I loved more than life itself, betrayed by my 
    closest friend...that I decided HE must die.&quot; <br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;And now I have succeeded.&quot; </font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Martine begins to laugh, softly at first, the human 
    voice most prevalent, then the tinny high-pitched laugh joins his human 
    voice. The laugh grows into a maniacal twist of rage and alien sounds.
    </font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Martine tells you, &quot;Thank you for showing me once 
    again the meaning of my life.&quot; </font></font></span>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you choose to give him 
    the letter, he will give you a book of Untranslated Yalaini Reports.</font></span></p>

    Martine tells you, &quot;How I loved her. I miss her so. But look what I have 
    done, what I have become. So many people dead by my hands, and the true 
    savior of this world...dead.&quot;<br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;What have I done? How could I have been duped in this 
    way? Read this.&quot;<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Martine gives you 
    Untranslated Yalaini Reports.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;You may need to have it translated if you cannot 
    understand Yalaini writing. But it is important you know.&quot;<br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;So much supposition now cleared. I see the truth for the 
    first time.&quot;<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">A tear falls from beneath 
    Martine's mask and lands upon the letter.<br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Martine tells you, &quot;How 
    often I sat and wept over this letter that she would never read. Now I weep 
    that if I can see her again I would not be the same man.&quot;<br>
    Martine tells you, &quot;Thank you. You have helped me realize that there is 
    still much to do. I must make amends. Go now, please.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2">If you try to give him the Husk after you have already given him the letter, 
    you will get this response: </font></span>

    leave.&quot;<br>
