Blackmoor in the Arwic Pub.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial" size="2">Antius Blackmoor tells 
	you, &quot;I am here against my better judgment. I had hoped that we would find 
	an answer to the growing Burun problem, but as of yet, the Arcanum's 
	scholars are not able to unlock the magic necessary to imbue weapons with 
	slaying properties. Thus I am here at the request of High Queen Elysa with a 
	proposition.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Antius Blackmoor tells you, &quot;Nuhmudira was removed from the council some 
	months ago for conduct that was not befitting of her position. No public 
	charges were levied, but she understood that there was an unspoken 
	accusation. I am here to see that she is given a message. That message is 
	one that I must support&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Antius Blackmoor tells you, &quot;Elysa is willing to grant her clemency in 
	return for her aid. We need you to seek her out and obtain the devices 
	necessary for finishing the Noble Weapons. They require the addition of a 
	complex gem. Once that gem is set in place they should become Burun slaying 
	weapons. Nuhmudira was last known to be residing in a remote cottage outside 
	of Uziz near an oasis on the rim of the A'mun desert.&quot;</font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Antius' demeanor changes slightly.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Antius Blackmoor tells you, &quot;Please, if she gives you the 
opportunity once you have obtained what you will need, ask her a simple 
question. Ask her if she let Oswald into the castle the night that Elysa was 
attacked. If you get an answer give that information to one of these guardians: 
Guard Chandler Hammett in Lytelthorpe, Guard Gabrielle in Rithwic, or Emissary 
Ydnew in Yanshi. They are three of the four members of the guard that I can 
absolutely trust. They will reward you for your service. Take great care on your 
journey and watch out for that monster.&quot;</font><br>

	<font color="#66FF99">Nuhmudira's Journal lies open to a page that holds 
	some interesting information. She has found the location of an island that 
	has been hidden for a great many years. She divined the location from 
	scripts that she found in one of the Falatacot temples that has been found 
	in the past few months. She means to build a device that will transport her 
	to this hidden island. She plans to build the device on the beach, in the

	friend Epica found Numuhdira's hidden cottage. It's near the Oasis outside 
	Uziz at at 20.8S,22.6E. However, it's hidden, so you need to run into the 
	entrance before you see the house. I'm not sure if this was planned or a 
	bug. Make sure you read the book in the lower sections of her house for 
	portal access.<br>
	<br>
	After you get the book, Recall to Sanctuary and run to 83.4S, 89.8E to get 
	to the new island. THE DROP IS HOT! Sclavus Lords are all around the &quot;New 
	Sanctuary.&quot; At the top is a portal to a Chapel, however, as soon as you 
	enter you receive a client.exe error -- I anticipate a hotfix!&quot;</font></p>

Hi Maggie! I think I've finally gotten it right this time, no more useless 
information.<br>
I managed to download the fix you posted and get through the portal before 
Turbine apparently closed the portalling device until morning. It worked 
perfectly, and inside was an interesting gallery of art related to the riddles 
asked by three ghosts dressed like Asheron.<br>
<br>
The path led to 3 dungeons, Xi Ru's Library, Crypt, and Remembrance. I entered 
the library first, and made the mistake of giving Nuhmudira the book you find at 
the end before going through the other two, so I'm stuck as to what their 
rewards were. Here are some pics of the middle of the island from above, the art 
inside the Chapel, and the Burun Slaying katar.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira 
tells you, &quot;Child, you come to me and ask a favor for the woman who has banished 
me from my home? Very well. She wishes to change these words, she wishes to make 
amends for her terrible slight, but she cannot come herself? What have I done 
for our people? Are my deeds so dark? Granting housing, providing the guidance 
and hope for our future... are these so minor that I should be cast aside like a 
useless rag for nothing more than supposition?&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Nuhmudira shakes her head.<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;It matters little. You are 
here at the behest of Elysa, but you have proven to me before that you have the 
interest of all Isparians within your heart. I need one small task undertaken 
before I grant you with what you need.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Within the library of this place is a book. These people 
were efficient, not opulent. Far less depraved than the Yalain, yet their 
predilection toward creating magical devices was still tantamount. I have yet to 
determine the period in which these people held sway on this world, but their 
language is opening to me very quickly. Bring me the book that I desire. It 
should be on a table, though if they were anything like Asheron's people it will 
be a free standing object.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Be warned, the Moarsmen guard this place with their lives. 
The have dug tunnels beneath this chapel and enter freely. Retrieve this book 
and I shall see you rewarded.&quot;</font></font></p>

<font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;You... are not familiar to me in any 
way.&quot;<br>
</font><font color="#00FF99">Nuhmudira looks you over. A simple flick of her 
fingers and you feel a wave of magic wash over your form.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Intriguing... Nonetheless, you come 
bearing news from Elysa. The very woman who wished me to never to return to 
-her- kingdom. A kingdom granted by an adoring populace that had known terror 
for years! A kingdom handed to her by a being unwilling, nay, unable to 
undertake the task himself because of paralyzing fear. You... are young. 
Misguided perhaps.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I am Nuhmudira, child. I am the creator of the sanctity 
that we Isparians are afforded on this world. For that, I am cast out because of 
baseless accusation and fear. It is a yoke akin to one I have borne since 
childhood. It is a curse that those with power must learn to bear.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I am not without generosity and compassion. Since Elysa 
has seen fit to forgive her accusations, I shall see fit to oblige her what she 
asks. But there is a small price.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Within this hall are two objects 
that I require to further my study of these unique people. The first is a book. 
It will be like many others in appearance. It will be located in the library 
beyond this hall. Bring that to me first. It will be indecipherable and foreign 
to your eyes. I will know it at once.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Second, I require a simple urn. It will hold the internal 
remains of the woman that held sway over the people here. She would have been 
interred in a very deliberate manner. These organs will have been preserved 
within this urn. Collect it and bring it to me after you have delivered the book 
and I will grant what Elysa desires of me.&quot;</font><br>

scorn. After all that I have done for our Race, for our people.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FF99"><br>
Nuhmudira shakes her head. &quot;You abandon me to death at the hands of that -- 
Empyrean! My memory is long, Darius of the Nexus.&quot; She pauses.<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Yet you 
come to me now and ask for help.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Very welll, you will receive my assistance, but there is a 
cost.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Within the halls beyond me are three objects that I 
require. I am not wont to leave my study of this place and have no students here 
at present to undertake this endeavor. You shall do.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I require a book from the library of this structure. It 
will appear as grand as the book that Asheron created. These people, while 
talented, were as degenerate and lavish as Asheron's ilk. To think, they would 
waste their arts on creating such garish items.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Collect the book and return it to me first.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;When that is complete I will need you to collect a small 
trifle of an object. These people believed in interring their dead in a unique 
fashion. These is an urn within a crypt here. That urn contains organs that 
these people thought precious above all else. They belonged to the woman who sat 
as the head of this chapel and this order. Fetch that urn and return it to me. 
This will leave only the final task.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Lastly, this woman was once possessed of great power. She 
had the ability to sway masses, lead and inspire by her presence alone. Now she 
lies in a sarcophagus. Dead, bones rotting away while time passes them and their 
secrets into dust. I require her corpse. Bring this to me at last, and I shall 
see that you receive what Elysa wants.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira smiles wryly and ushers you towards you tasks.</font></span></p>

this?&quot;<br>

Answer (highlight area below):<br>
--------------------<br>
<font color="#6B6B6B">Geraine IV</font><br>
--------------------</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#FFFF99">Hevk Loz tells you, &quot;Sickly from birth, Geraine IV, was 
taken by sisters who had stepped aside from the path and brought into a state 
that would forever sustain his body, soul and mind. Geraine in turn taught his 
people, but the sisters were not so foolish to not enter this state themselves. 
Many sleep, while in waking dreams, they think their time nears as a new singer 
raises her voice. But what of Geraine? His life is over, but still he endures, 
watches and waits. His death began his life anew.&quot;<br>
Hevk Loz tells you, &quot;You have proven to me that you are aware of what has 
transpired on this world. I give you my word that you shall see the halls 
beyond. Speak to my brothers and prove your worthiness to them. If you succeed

walls of the chapel. Their busts carved by my own hands. My name is Jif Loz, it 
is all I retain of my life before. Nothing can halt the ruination of my memory. 
It is a position of grace that I gladly accepted in a time when all who walked 
in Light were not lost. Ages have past, the only telling of those ages lies in 
the art that I create. You wish, as the one who has come before you, to enter 
this chapel and learn what my brothers and I have recorded as these ages have 
past.&quot;<br>
Jif Loz tells you, &quot;You must know of what has transpired before you may enter.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Jif Loz tells you, &quot;In the age of the Yalain, one came to 
Ithaenc and laid waste to the sisters there. All were slaughtered, none 
survived, light was drawn thin as darkness continued to slip into the hearts of 
the guardians. Who lead that slaughter, who gave the orders to murder the 
sisters of Ithaenc Cathedral?&quot;<br>
Jif Loz tells you, &quot;I have carved and polished three busts along the wall of 
this room, each represents an individual from that time. Choose your answer 
wisely and you shall be given leave to enter this place. Fail and you will need

the Northern Church. Misguided crusaders loyal to the Nali visited mistress 
Aurlanna and knelt before her with proud voices proclaiming victory over the

this place will inspire works of art. In time, the three races that now strive 
for peace shall be known in statues across this hall. I shall carve likenesses 
with my own hands and offer them for future generations to see. The Age of the 
children from another sun shall be born in that vision and there shall be memory 
cast within that stone. My name is Kir Loz, my name and art are all I retain 
from the time when I lived. But this was a path I chose freely. I, like my 
brothers, record history as it transpires and form it into art that can retain 
the knowledge of that age. You wish, as the one who has come before you, to 
enter this chapel and learn what my brothers and I have recorded.&quot;<br>
Kir Loz tells you, &quot;You must know of what has transpired before you may enter.&quot;<br>
Kir Loz tells you, &quot;Forsaking her children and Au, she laid waste to the 
crusaders that scoured the halls of Ithaenc clean. Her will crushed, she went 
beyond the stars one last time. She has yet to return. Who is she?&quot;<br>
Kir Loz tells you, &quot;Along the landing of this room I have placed the statues of 
three such beings. Choose the answer to my question wisely and you shall be 
given my blessing to pass into this chapel. Fail and I shall need you to rethink 
the purpose of your task within and ask that you return when you know more of 
this world.&quot;<br>

Answer (highlight area below):<br>
-------------------<br>
<font color="#6B6B6B">Aurlanna</font><br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Kir Loz tells you, &quot;Alighting on wings, head hung in 
grief, looking down one last time on her aerie, watching as her children looked 
up, Aurlanna flew into the heavens and beyond the stars never to return. Her 
heart was shattered when she found that those that she had once called sisters 
had been killed by zealots blinded by the purpose of a throne that had forsaken 
its true path for power. She felt the urge to join with madness within her and 
so she left Auberean, hopeful that its defender would rise and take his place.&quot;<br>
Kir Loz tells you, &quot;You have proven to me that you are aware of what has 
transpired on this world. I give you my word that you shall see the halls 
beyond. Speak to my brothers and prove your worthiness to them. If you succeed 
the door to this chapel shall be yours to open evermore.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After answering 
the three riddles, go to Ki Ru's Sanctum and use the Library portal. (Talk to

contains Miry Moarsman and Muck Gluttons and some levers. At top you'll find the 
Indecipherable Book. Take back to Nuhmudira.</font></span></p>

Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Most impressive, dear child. You have pleased me greatly. 
Take this, it is a small token. You will need to craft it yourself. It is a 
pittance to make. You will need a fair amount of Burun blood to complete the 
process with the gem.&quot;<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Nuhmudira gives you Soul

Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;When you have found a large enough sample of burun blood 
apply it to the stone. The stone will drink the blood and take on the properties 
that will most harm the Burun. Affix the stone to your weapon or wand, and the 
magic will flow into the item. We will survive this latest threat, child. Fear 
not.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Because of your service to me in the past I want to give 
you a little more. Please, open your mind to me.&quot;<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Go in peace child. Leave me to my task.&quot;</font></span></p>

Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;You are doing well, child. There are still two object to

precious.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next (for those 
who didn't save her) Xi Ru's Crypt for the Urn. You'll need 2 people to manage 
the triggers.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Directions from 
Sanddh of WE:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Door up ramps 
again, straight this time. You really NEED 2 people here. Lever to go through 
door &amp; portal.<br>
<br>
At first intersection, go right and immediately left up a ramp. Doors, buttons 
everywhere. Room. another ramp, left, go up ramp, big room.&nbsp; Here's the 
trick:<br>
<br>
Before you enter the room, there are two buttons. Open the door to the room, let 
someone go to NNW corner room, push other button, person 1 goes in, opens door 
for person 2, and runs to NEE corner room. Person 2 runs to dead end, there's a 
trigger plate there to open door NEE. Always check if door is opened, otherwise 
you can start all over. <br>
<br>
So: person 1 stands in front to-be-open-door, steps in, opens door for person 2, 
goes to next door. Person 2 runs to trigger plate, opens next door, runs back to 
big room. Rinse repeat.<br>
Door sequence: 1. NNW; 2. ENE, 3. WSW, 4. NNE, 5. SSW, 6. WNW, 7. ESE, 8. SSW.<br>
<br>
Last trigger plate will open the door in the middle of S wall. Person 1 gets in. 
To open door for person 2, the button is UP.<br>
To get up, you need to shift jump 3 stepping stones that fade in and out vision 
the whole time. No worries, they are there all the time. Up there, person 1 
opens door for person 2.<br>
<br>
Fight your way to the portal. On the other side, over a half-invisible catwalk, 
is the urn.<br>
<br>
Return urn to Nummie, if you never made a choice, you're done. If you chose to 
damn her, you have one more dungeon.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Note: Maxim 
Afinogenov of TD reports the Urn can be soloed with a high jump skill:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;In the final 
room (the one with 2 buttons outside the door) there are large platforms you can 
jump to on the left and right. Do not kill the spawn in the room so you can jump 
on the Moarsman for a little extra boost. Once on the platform, I had to jump on 
top of one of the statues in order to make the jump to the Urn. I made that jump 
with ease, got the Urn and then the portal. I did this with a jump of 429 so I 
am not sure of the lower limit jump.&quot;</font></span></p>

You give Nuhmudira Burial Urn. </font>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Another service out of the way and only one before you. 
The more time you waste with me, the more time your precious Queen needs to wait 
to have her desire sated. Quickly now, retrieve the corpse.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next Xi Ru's 
Rememberance for the ashes. Again, you'll need 2 people for the door triggers.

Sanddh of WE:</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Again, door, this 
time right. Also here, 2 people needed. Lever, door, portal.<br>
Go right, ramp, open door with button, you're in a big room with platforms and a 
catwalk up in the air. go underneath either of the platforms and fight your way 
up. There's a small room with a lever. 1 person stays there. The other goes on, 
opens door to platform, and in the middle of the catwalk is the next door. 
person 1 opens that door with the lever. Little shift jump to get from catwalk 
through door. Wait on other side near button for lever puller. Right, down ramp, 
down again, right, down ramp again, a door with 2 buttons. Kill the moarsman, 
use both buttons to open both doors. Room with paintings and crypt. Door to 
crypt can be opened simply by double click :). double click sarcophagus to get 
corpse. <br>
Portal, and back to Nummie, who is STILL pissed.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">
You reach into the sarcophagus and begin to collect the bones of this woman. 
There are no adornments to her corpse. These is only a simple mosaic on the 
inside of the coffin. A sun, a star, a tree and what appears to be a world. The 
motif repeats along the entirety of the coffin. You get an ill feeling in the 
back of your mind and feel sick to your stomach. Your thoughts trail to the 
natural order of all there is and you suddenly feel as though you have disrupted 
that order.<br>
The feeling passes, but the thought lingers in your mind for a long moment.</font></span></p>

I also checked how well it worked vs some of the Burun in BM5. Without frost 
vuln, it wasn't quite as good as a rend. With, I was getting normal hits of 
around 650. As the Guruk Colossus I was testing on has 650 hp, I one shot em 
with a vuln about 60% to 70% of the time. My recommendation is to still use a 
rending wand for lower hp Burun, and use the new wand on high hp Burun critters 
(for mages anyhow, not sure how well it fares for melee). Thanks again for a 
great site! </font></span></p>
