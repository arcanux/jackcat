town.&quot; <br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Normally it isn't this quiet, but we've been having a bit 
of a problem.&quot; <br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Have you seen that mountain peak to the North? That's 
Mount Ingot, a homicidal Magma Golem named Scold lives up there. Every few weeks 
he emerges from his cave and marches down the mountain to stomp all over our 
town. Oh the snomanity, oh, it's awful!&quot; </font><br>

Scold). Each Scold Chuck you kill breaks into two smaller Scold Lumps (level

Mayor tells you, &quot;If you haven't had one of Chef Pleist's pies you haven't 
lived. Oh, they are so cold and delicious. Now I'm hungry.&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Not long ago, we traveled to these mountains escaping the 
dangerous and hot lowlands. We found this little frozen hollow and loved it so 
much that we named it Frost Haven and built our town here. Now we may not be 
safe even here. Oh, Scold makes me so mad!&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Elijah is a master ice mechanic. He can build just about 
anything out of ice. Hehe, I remember that crazy flying machine he made. It 
worked too, but it flew off before he could get in.&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Destroy, rebuild, destroy, rebuild. You think he would 
have gotten bored with it by now, but he really seems to hate us.&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;We lost Frank, our biggest snowman, in the last attack. 
Scold is now officially public enemy number one!&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Scold bellowed something when he stomped out of town that 
time, &quot;Leave or be consumed by my fiery wrath.&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;Chilling isn't it?&quot;<br>
The Mayor says, &quot;Keep a cool head that's the thing to do.&quot;<br>
The Mayor tells you, &quot;I'm hoping for a snowstorm. Scold doesn't come out when 
it's snowing heavily. Plus, the colder it gets the stronger we get.&quot;</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99"><br>

Nip tells you, &quot;Someday I'll be bigger than Scold and then he'll see.&quot;<br>

him and wish he would die.&quot;<br>
Numb says, &quot;Jump! Jump! I'm the winner!&quot;<br>
Numb says, &quot;I win! Haha! Yes!&quot;<br>
Numb tells you, &quot;What's black and white and goes fizzle-splash?&quot; &quot;A Snowman with 
a fire wand!&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99"><br>
You give Numb Scold's Heart.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Numb tells you, &quot;Wow, how did you do it? Did he burn you 
or melt and of your friends? What was his cave like? Did he say anything about 
our village? Huh, did he?&quot;<br>
Numb tells you, &quot;You're not bad for a human. Mom says that humans can be 
dangerous. I guess your sorta are, but you kick golem butt, so you're a good 
kindof dangerous.&quot;<br>
Numb tells you, &quot;Heh, maybe someday I'll save a human town from evil and then we 
can all live together in peace. That would be cool.&quot;<br>
Numb Tells you, &quot;I'd like to give you theese special snowballs I make. They 
don't hurt anyone, but they make a big Poof when they hit.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Numb gives you 10 Huge Snowballs.</font><br>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Elijah tells you, &quot;I've been 
studying Scold - with the burning and the melting and excruciating pain, RUN FOR 
YOUR LIVES!&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;He seems weak to cold attacks.&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;What?&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;I tried ice-bombing Scold's cave last week, but he must have 
some heat source down there. Otherwise he should have been frozen solid almost 
instantly.&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;I would like to have a piece of Scold to study should you 
find one, say during your frenzied death march on his cave.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#66FF99"><br>
You give Elijah Scold's Heart.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Elijah tells you, &quot;Ow! It's still hot, and burning. The 
fact that it still gives off heat is interesting. Let's see, I have your reward 
over here.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Elijah gives you Ice Box.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Elijah tells you, &quot;I just finished it. It's a marvel of 
ice and function. You will see here the controls with three settings: Chilly, 
Freezing and 'My fingers are stuck to the ice, it's so cold.'&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;It works on the Frostian Principle of inverse hyper-therma-whatchamaglavins.&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;What's it for? Well, the theory is obvious to even the 
simplest of advanced thermo-mechanical engineers.&quot;<br>
Elijah tells you, &quot;Oy! For winter's sake! It keeps your house cool.&quot;</font></font><p align="left">

<font color="#FFFF99">Robert tells you, &quot;I once saw a rabbit try to steal a 
carrot from my garden. Why he was even up<span lang="en-us"> </span>here in the 
first place I don't know. Anyway, he seemed so happy with himself when he dug 
the<span lang="en-us"> </span>carrot out that I didn't have the heart to stop 
him.&quot;<br>
Robert tells you, &quot;You should have seen the look on his little rabbit face when 
he tried to bite<span lang="en-us"> </span>into it. Guess he wasn't used to ice 
carrots. Funny little critter.&quot;<br>
Robert says, &quot;Oh, another weed.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Robert Scold's Heart.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Robert tells you, &quot;Well, I'll be! You made it back in one 
piece! I have to admit I thought taking<span lang="en-us"> </span>on Scold in 
his own cave was a bit crazy, but you proved how lucky you are!&quot;<br>
Robert tells you, &quot;I'm a snowman of my word, so here's your reward.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Robert gives you Carrot Dagger.</font><br>

I'm quite busy, but I love guests -- so just sit anywhere you like and we can 
have some tea and a nice chat.&quot;<br>
Emma tells you, &quot;Nip and Numb are such good boys. I worry how this whole Scold 
thing is affecting them though. I think Nip is getting a bit angry. Have you 
ever seen an angry snowman? I don't want that for my son.&quot; Emma tells you, &quot;You 
look like a kind human. Please help us.&quot;<br>
Emma tells you, &quot;That big brute of a golem! Scold actually enjoys destroying our 
little town. He must have had a bad childhood, but that's no excuse to take it 
out on us!&quot;</font><font color="#66FF99"><br>
You give Emma Scold's Heart.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Emma tells you, &quot;Oh! You made it back alright! I'm so very 
happy! And you brought proof of Scold's demise. I can't thank you enough! Here's 
a little something I froze for you while you were gone.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Emma gives you Snowflake.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Emma tells you, &quot;It's magically resistant to heat so it 
won't melt. It hope it will helps to remind you not to chop up people just 
because they are made of snow.&quot;
</font></font>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Chef Pleist tells you, &quot;I know 
people who know people who might be able to take care of Scold -- but once I 
call that favor in, I'll owe them one. And you don't want to owe these guys 
nothin'! So, if you can teach that magma-hucker a lesson, I would be very 
grateful.&quot;<br>
Chef Pleist tells you, &quot;Eh, if it helps, I'll chill you up somethin' real 
delicious for after you give Scold his ice-bath. He should lay of the spicy 
food, it's bad for his disposition.&quot;<br>
Chef Pleist tells you, &quot;I only use the freshest snows and ice in my cooking. If 
you can't make it fresh don't make it.&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99"><br>
You give Chef Pleist Scold's Heart.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>

Chef Pleist tells you, &quot;You remind me of this guy I knew. He was a good guy, a 
little thick, but a<br>
good guy, ya know?&quot;<br>
Chef Pleist tells you, &quot;Here you go. It just came out of the Ice Box.&quot;<br>
