      Martine of the Dereth Exploration Society recently went into the Blackmire

      believe, but Martine's troubles didn't begin with the Virindi! Instead, he 
      got himself mixed up with Mosswarts. Speak to his friend, Olivier Rognath 
      in Eastham (17.5N, 63.3E), avid Banderling hobbyist and Society Explorer 
      wanna-be, for more information.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

      <font color="#FFFF99">Olivier Rognath tells you, &quot;Hello! Have you seen my 
      friend, Sir Martine? He has been missing for quite some time now. I had 
      heard the Society had sent him out on a Mosswart research expedition, but 
      I assumed he would have been back by now.&quot;<br>
      Olivier Rognath tells you, &quot;If you come across any strange Banderling 
      artifacts, please come see me at once. I am an avid Banderling hobbyist. 
      And please, no Banderling scalps! I want to study these creatures, not 
      kill them!&quot;<br>
      Olivier Rognath tells you, &quot;No, I am no longer quite as nimble as I once 
      was, so I have not been able to procure an Explorer designation from the 
      Society as yet. Sir Olivier Rognath does roll off the tongue quite nicely, 
      though, eh? Perhaps it will happen in the future.&quot;<br>
      Olivier Rognath tells you, &quot;Poor Sir Candeth. I begin to fear the worst. I 
      wish I knew where he had been sent off to. I heard a rumor the outpost was 
      some distance west of Sawato. But sometimes the Society can be quite 
      secretive, you know.&quot;</font></font></p>

      to the Journal; the west exit takes you to the Banderling Mace Shaft.</font></span></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">From the south exit simply 
      go straight at the split past the Banderling Raider. Open the door and 
      you'll see A Battered Leather Journal lying on the floor. If you continue

      again. You'll encounter more Raiders and Ravers. At the next intersection
