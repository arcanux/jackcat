      <p>
		<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Aun Aulakhe tells you, 
		&quot;Several moons ago, my father Shimauri summoned us to his accustomed 
		story hour, to tell of a story never heard by my generation.&quot;<br>
		Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;Long ago, in the combined pasts of the Hea and 
		Aun, Aun Tanua was a nigh-legendary warrior who was beloved by our xuta. 
		He left our gates to challenge the Puh in his mudflats of Ahurenga, 
		never to return. We thought perhaps he had been captured or slain by the 
		Hea, but now we have discovered the truth: when they were unable to 
		conquer him, the Hea called upon the Atua ngamaru. Answering them, the 
		floating demons bore down and plunged him down into the depths of the 
		Lightning-Sea, never to be heard of again.&quot;<br>
		Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;My task is to find warriors brave enough to 
		enter the Lightning-Sea, who can search for him and bring him back to 
		us. My buhdi Tikakhe tells me that you might be the person we are 
		looking for.&quot;<br>
		Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;When you find Tanua, warm him with the ember of 
		the akiekie fire that you see on the ground, for there is no telling how 
		Aun Tanua's mind might have fared in his captivity.&quot;<br>
		Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;My training, both in my homeland and with the 
		Aualuan of your xuta, has taught me to create the Burning Pools that 
		shimmer upon the Lightning-Sea. I have opened such a portal on the 
		surface of the akiekie pond, and if you dare swim its depths, enter it 
		and find Aun Tanua!&quot;<br>
		Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;A word of advice: All must depend upon the 
		coordination of their fellows to navigate the Shimmering Sea. Farewell, 
		and Tanae speed you in your hunt.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;When Aulakhe first came and told me he was 
		leaving Timaru, I knew I could not let him go alone. We have journeyed 
		across the breadth of Dereth on our quest, and I have seen much that 
		could be used to create semblances of the items we had back on Palenqual.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;In the days since we have settled here, even 
		more powerful spirits than before have pledged their aid in the creation 
		of the Buadrens much like the one you see in my hands.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;The great Aualuan Kenchaua has sent word from 
		the mountains of the south that Ebon Mattekar pledged his hides to form 
		Buadren's head.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;Fire Shreth from the plains of the north has 
		pledged his hides to form Buadren's sinews.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;As we finally settled here, near the akiekie of 
		Aula's new ani, Ispar Celdisethaua, Mighty Oak promised his limbs to 
		form Buadren's body.&quot;<br>
		Aun Tikakhe tells you, &quot;Once you assemble these three gifts, give the 
		hide of Ebon Mattekar to me. I will inspect it for its imperfections--if 
		it is perfect, I will give you a fragrant oil brought from Timaru to tan 
		it into a supple drumskin. Tanae speed your hunt, friend.&quot;</font></p>

      </span></b><span lang="en-us">After making your Buadren and speaking to 
      Aun Aulahkhe and getting your ember, you're ready to prepare. Go as 
      no-drop as you can. It's unlikely you'll be able to recover your corpse if 
      you die. Recommended Equipment: Greater Shadow Armor, or a Robe and Plate 
      Gauntlets; Aegis Shield; a health adding item, such as Elysa's Favor, 
      Callous Heart, or Jaleh's necklace; dispell gems. </span></font><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The creatures you'll 
      encounter are Quiddity
      <a href="../../Pets/rift.htm">Rifts</a> and
      <a href="../../Pets/doll.htm">Energy Clusters</a>. Quiddity 
      Rifts can only be killed by 
      90+ mages. Energy Clusters have thick armor and are war resistant. Both vuln/war 
      with bludge/fire and both debuff. Physical attacks from the Rifts are non-specific; they 
      ignore everything... armor, protections, shields, everything. Clusters use slash 
      and an assortment of elementals but the attacks aren't very strong unless 
      you've been vulned. </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your weapon is irrelevant. Only the 80+ group can fight and only if they have 
      a huge group. Don't bother buffing one. </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Buff with all life 
      protections (at the very least, armor, fire, lighthing and bludgeon). Use 
      Impen, and bane for slashing and the 4 elemental attacks. Also buff 
      sprint, quickness, endurance and healing mastery.</font></span><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">You'll need at the very 
      barest minimum 2 players from each of the level groups: 50-59, 60-69, 
      70-79, 80+. You may also wish to turn down your graphics.</span></font><p>

      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Portal Space dungeon is 
      restricted to levels 50+. The drop in is safe. You'll be on a portal 
      stairway where you'll need to jump from ledge to ledge to reach your 
      portal. The party now splits into the 4 groups: 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The levers throughout the 
      dungeon work the same way. The 50s pull for the 60s; 60s pull for the 70s; 
      70s pull for the 80+; the 80+ pull for the 50s. You don't have to be right 
      next to the levers to open them, but you do have to stand still after 
      activating them for them to actually work. You'll know they're working 
      when the beads that make it up start separating and moving up. Each group 
      should designate their lever puller and practice at this point if 
      necessary.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you're ready, use the 
      lever and run past the door, then stop immediately! Wait at the top of the 
      ramp and avoid the critters for the moment. Fighting will just get you 
      killed.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>LILITHA'S ROOM &amp; INVISO

      <br>
      Going to Lilitha's Room is optional, but for the lower levels it saves them a bit of 
      a run. More importantly, Lilitha's room lets you rebalance the groups by 
      level. Once you've used the lever and gone through the door, each section 
      will continue until they hit an invisible portal.<br>
      <br>
      --50s Team - Head down the ramp and hug the right wall. You should reach 
      it shortly after the 2nd intersection.<br>
      <br>
      --60s Team - Head down the ramp and hug the left wall. You should reach it 
      shortly after the 2nd intersection.<br>
      <br>
      --70s Team - Keep to the left until the 4-way intersection. Make a right 
      heading east until you reach another intersection. Take a right at the 
      split and the portal should be just before you hit the next 4 way 
      intersection.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">--80+ Team - Keep to the 
      right until the 4-way intersection. Make a left heading south until you 
      reach another intersection. Take a left at the split and the portal should 
      be just before you hit the next 4 way intersection. </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">All four invisio portals 
      drop you in a semi-safe small room with a door. Past the door is a room, 
      short corridor, then a set of rooms linked with corridors. A ramp up leads 
      to a semi-safe area where you can observe Lilitha trapped in her prison. A 
      corridor with a ramp down leads to an exit portal.</font></span><p>

      <b>THE ROOM OF DEATH</b></font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After taking the exit from 
      Lilitha's Room, you'll be making your way to the portal into the next 
      section. Again you'll be split into four groups, but the level 
      restrictions are broader, giving you the chance to shift people around if 
      necessary. The four sections are restricted as follows: 50-70, 60-80, 
      70-90, 80+.<br>
      <br>
      The drops for the 50s and 60s are safe, but the 70s and 80s are camped by 
      baddies, so hit the ground running.<br>
      <br>
      --50s Team - Turn right heading north at the drop and hug the right wall 
      down two ramps and up into the final room. The lever and door are on the 
      west wall.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">--60s Team - Take the 
      passage to your left heading west and hug the left wall all the way to the 
      final room. The lever and door are on the south wall.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">--70s Team - Turn left then 
      curve south from the drop. When you see the first corridor on your left, 
      go past it heading south. At the next intersection, keep to the left 
      heading south. Hug the left wall all the way to the final room.&nbsp; The 
      lever and door are on the east wall.</font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">--80+ Team - Turn left then 
      curve east from the drop. When you see the first corridor on your left, go 
      past it heading east. At the the next intersection, keep to the left 
      heading east. Hug the left wall all the way to the final room.&nbsp; The 
      lever and door are on the north wall.<br>
      <br>
      The levers will be guarded by Quiddity Rifts. Many quests dissolve in this 
      room. With larger groups, if everyone hits the room about the same time, 
      the levers need to be pulled once and only once and everyone escapes 
      through the door. If any of the doors does not open, the entire quest 
      group dies, stranding the party.</font></span><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Tetsujin Sujitsu<span lang="en-us"> of TD 
      offers this tactic:</span><br>
      <br>
      <span lang="en-us">The level 80+ lever puller goes first and pulls the 
      lever for the 50s team. All doors stay open for five minutes. He then runs 
      back to the group, with a ton of critters on his back! Generally, most of 
      the creatures won't follow all the way up, but if one or two do, the group 
      can kill them.</span></font><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">As soon as the 80+ lever 
      puller tells the 50s team the door is open, the 50s run down and go 
      through the door. The last person through is the lever puller who pulls 
      the lever next to door before going through.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span lang="en-us">The 50s lever puller tells the 60s to run for it. The

      opening the door for the 70s before going through. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span lang="en-us">Then the 60s lever puller tells the 70s to make a run

      <span lang="en-us">Other teams choose to go on suicide missions and pull 
      the lever and just die. Mules have been sent to complete the task. Larger

      then pull.</span></font><p>

      All drops are semi-safe. A cluster may come investigate if you linger too 
      long. When you enter, you'll se a &quot;portal stair&quot; in front of you, through 
      a window. One route leads to an exit portal, another back to the room of 
      death, and the path you want goes to the next section. You'll be keeping 
      to either your left or your right all the way (whichever way you start out 
      of the stair, keep in that direction). </font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">As before, the 80+ lever 
      puller goes first down the staircase alone. This won't be as dangerous as 
      the last room, as the staircase is generally a safe area. Once the 80+ 
      lever puller opens the 50s door, they head down. Again the 50s open for 
      the 60s on the way through, the 60s open for the 70s, the 70s open for the 
      80+, and the entire 80+ team heads through last.</font></span><p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">After you go through the 
      door, the 50s and 80+ teams should keep to the left. The 60s and 70s keep 
      to the right. You'll hit another invisio portal (almost immediately) and 
      all four groups will drop into the Empyrean room together. </span><br>

      Find the Tumerok Aun Tanua in the center of the room at the top of the 
      stairs to turn in your ember. (Don't enter any portals or go down any 
      ramps.) To be on the safe side, when talking to him, make sure you aren't 
      in combat mode and don't move until you hear all the dialog and have your 
      ember back. When you hand him your ember, he will infuse it with his keh 
      and returns a Burning Akiekie Ember.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#66FF99">Aun 
    Tanua slowly turns towards you, surprise barely flickering across his 
    careworn eyes. He almost reaches out to touch your arm, but conditioned 
    imprints of lightning-pain, years of throwing his fading body against 
    electric walls, jolts a recoil through his frame.</font><font color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;A face. I see a face. Not Tonk. Not Atua ngamaru. I 
    see a face.&quot;<br>
    Aun 
    Tanua tells you, &quot;Atual arutoa?&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Aun Tanua starts shivering uncontrollably and shrinks 
    within himself.<br>
    </font><font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;Not here. Not here. Not 
    here.&quot;<br>
    </font><font color="#66FF99">You give Aun Tanua Akiekie Ember.<br>
    Aun Tanua gently cups the ember in his clawed hands, and as its glow warms 
    his skin, his past gradually seeps into memory. For the first instant in an 
    endless monotony of time, he remembers. Ezheret. Palenqual. Timaru. Home.
    <br>
    As determination and strength return to the old warrior's stance, he turns 
    to you once more.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;I have no knowledge of how long 
    I have been imprisoned here. Endless half moments on moments, my memory 
    failing, my own keh draining away...All I know is that I cannot leave, for 
    the Atua ngamaru have me captured inside these walls of light.&quot;<br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;My own Timaru is far from me, but you have brought me 
    an ember of her heart, and once again my people are with me. You must have 
    been sent with this gift by one of my brethren, and for that I thank you.&quot;<br>
    Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;There is but one way to let my brothers envision my 
    fate, and I must ask one more favor of you.&quot;</font><br>
    <font color="#66FF99">Aun Tanua lifts the akiekie ember to his face and 
    softly blows across its faintly glowing surface. As his keh suffuses the 
    ember, it suddenly fans into a flame. He holds it a moment longer, then 
    relinquishes it to your care.<br>
    Aun Tanua gives you Burning Akiekie Ember.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Aun Tanua tells you, &quot;Give this to the one that sent 
    you here to me. He will understand its intent and what should be done. Go 
    now, and if you ever tread upon the shores of Palenqual, let her know I am 
    with her.&quot;</font></font></span><p>
      <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you have the Burning

      drum with a shimmering intensity. When it seems as if the Buadren itself 
      will catch fire, Aulakhe removes it from the flames.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
      Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;You have done the Aun of Timaru a great service

      greatest need, invoke him, and he will come to your aid.&quot;<br>
      Aun Aulakhe tells you, &quot;My own mission here is not finished, for I shall 
      not walk through the gates of Timaru until the day when Aun Tanua himself 
      may walk beside me. If you would like to brave Aun Tanua's prison once 
      more, come to me in a month's time, when I will have regained the strength 
      to stabilize the Lightning-Sea. At that time, I will not be able to create
