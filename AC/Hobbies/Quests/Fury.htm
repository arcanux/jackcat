    just outside of town. Speak with her and she will charge you with a task to

    <font color="#FFFF99">Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, &quot;Hello. I am Mage Syltyn 
    Rillon, a member of the Explorer Society. Perhaps you are wondering about 
    the sword on the dias in town. I had been a friend of Martine's back on 
    Ispar. I encountered Martine here, during one of his mad rampages. He knew 
    not who I was, nor did he seem to care and the encounter ended badly for me. 
    Upon arriving at the Lifestone I was angry, yet understood that the Virindi 
    were principally at fault for causing Martine's actions. I became determined 
    to help fellow Isparians combat the Virindi and other perils of this harsh 
    land. With the help of Omaro Nagate the weaponsmith, I crafted a frost sword 
    that should be of good utility to adventurers who are skilled in the ways of 
    the blade.&quot;<br>
    Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, &quot;To obtain this weapon you must first prove 
    your worthiness. There is a Virindi complex north of Bandit Road. I left a 
    note on a tree along Bandit Road, east of Neydisa Castle, marking the 
    location where you should turn north. Go to the complex, navigate through it 
    and bring to me a Virindi Signet. I shall then allow you to take the sword.&quot;<br>
    Mage Syltyn Rillon tells you, &quot;Oh, take this. It will aid you in your 
    journey through part of the complex. Read it carefully.&quot;</font><br>

    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are 
    three parts to the dungeon. The first involves jumping down a series of 
    large steps, fighting Altered and Augmented
    <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudges</a>, Tusker
    <a href="../../Pets/tusker.htm">Guards</a>, and
    <a href="../../Pets/virindi.htm">Virindi</a> 
    Directors and Observers. For the second part, you must use
    <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Paths.htm">A Tale of 
    Paths</a> to solve a portal puzzle and navigate yourself through a series of 
    rooms. At the end of the third section are the
    <a href="../../Pets/virindi.htm">Virindi</a> 
    Interrogators. In addition to the
    <a href="../../Pets/drudge.htm">Drudges</a> and
    <a href="../../Pets/virindi.htm">Virindi</a>, you'll 
    also be fighting Terebrous
    <a href="../../Pets/hollow.htm">Hollow Minions</a> 
    and Silver <a href="../../Pets/tusker.htm">Tuskers</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    The first section is fairly easy. After dropping in from the portal, you'll 
    jump down a series of 5 large steps. Each landing has one or two creatures 
    to fight, so it's very manageable to solo. Follow the hallway at the bottom, 
    then jump down 7 more steps. Collect a Virindi Obsidian Shard from the floor 
    if you want to translate it for lore later, then follow the corridor until 
    it opens up into a large room. Head to the far side the follow the hall 
    until you reach a T. Either route takes you to the same place, a room with a 
    copy of <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Paths.htm">A 
    Tale of Paths</a> on the floor and portals to the east and west. This is the&nbsp; 
    starting point of the portal room puzzle.</font></span></p>

    exit, you'll be facing a large grate with electrical energy shooting up from 
    the floor. Head to the far side and look for the passage on your left. The 
    first part of this section is very straightforward. Follow the hallway, 
    ignoring the side passages, killing the

    <a href="../../Pets/virindi.htm">Virindi</a> and 
    occasional Pristine <a href="../../Pets/doll.htm">
    Doll</a>. Eventually, the hall will veer south and you'll head down a ramp 
    (if you see an open pinkish glowing room, you're close). Again, follow the 
    hall until you reach a room with a flame column. Jump down to the level 
    below and take the north passage.</font></span></p>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Continue down 
    the passage heading north. You'll soon come a open area with a few Virindi 
    Executors high on a platform. Go through the room and take the passage on

    <a href="../../Pets/hollow.htm">Hollow Minions</a> 
    and a few Silver <a href="../../Pets/tusker.htm">
    Tuskers</a>. Just keep following the corridor up and around until you reach 
    a T. Head East into the red virindi section. When you reach the room with 
    the Banderling, Olthoi and Chittick trapped in red energy, you'll encounter 
    your first Virindi Interrogator. Kill it and pick up the Virindi Signet (7 
    day timer). Additionally, you can pick up an </font></span>
