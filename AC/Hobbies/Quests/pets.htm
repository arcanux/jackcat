<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi, Maggie, Elizabtha Lazulae of 
Harvestgain here (again). Hope you had a great holiday, and that you're feeling 
much better :).<br>
<br>
I'm sure you've already been inundated with pictures of the new patch, so I've 
gone into detail about the new pets quest. Hope this is of some use to you:<br>
<br>
Tipping a town crier got me a message about a woman selling pets near the 
Obsidian Span between Holtburg and Cragstone, so I followed the road south from 
Holtburg until I came to a building at 35.2n 39.3e. Inside were four vendors 
with pens full of baby creatures and Larinne Kerendova, who appears to be 
running the whole shop.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Tamara Mistrunner tells you, &quot;I train and sell Ursuin 
Cubs. Want one?&quot;<br>
Tamara Mistrunner tells you, &quot;If you do, bring me a Baby Pet Token, and I'll 
give you one of my cubs. If you seek a token, ask Larinne Kerendova, over by the 
entrance to the shop.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ma-Kii tells you, &quot;I train and sell well-mannered baby Drudges.&quot;<br>
Ma-Kii tells you, &quot;If you bring me a Baby Pet Token, and I will give you an Baby 
Drudge Crate in return. If you wish a token, ask Larinne Kerendova, who is over 
by the entrance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gharon al-Bhavarn tells you, &quot;I am a trader in fine Armoredillo Eggs. These eggs 
are enchanted to allow you to call forth from inside a docile Armoredillo Pup, 
who will follow you in your travels.&quot;<br>
Gharon al-Bhavarn tells you, &quot;Simply bring me a Baby Pet Token, and I will give 
you an Armoredillo Egg in return. If you seek a token, ask Larinne Kerendova, by 
the entrance to this humble shop.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Elise Du Ricard tells you, &quot;I trade in baby Thrungus, 
catering to those who like unusual and... creative pets.&quot;<br>
Elise Du Ricard tells you, &quot;Simply bring me a Baby Pet Token, and I will give 
you a Baby Thrungus Crate. If you need a token, ask Larinne Kerendova, over by 
the door.&quot;<br>
</font><br>
Able to take a hint, I went for a chat with Larinne.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Welcome to my shop!&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;If you'd like a pet of your own, I can provide the 
token you will need to acquire one. Normally, I'd just sell these, but I'm in 
need of a bit of help, and I'm willing to waive payment in coin if you'll help 
me out.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;I have four letters that I need delivered to 
certain people around Dereth. Normally I'd go to deliver these myself, but there 
is so much to do with the shop open now, that I don't have the time.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Take these letters, bring back word from the 
people they go to, and I'll give you a token you can trade for an adorable new 
pet.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;The first letter goes to Renald the Eldest in 
Holtburg, the second to Nen Ai, along the road southwest of Shoushi, the third 
to May'ad ibn Ibsar in Yaraq, and the final one to Turien Di Furza in Sanamar.&quot;<br>
</font><br>
Ah, so it's one of those quests. Fortunately both my patron and I are tied to 
the lifestone in Sanamar, where there happens to be a mini portal hub to Shoushi, 
Yaraq and Holtburg. So to Sanamar first, where Turien di Furza hangs out near 
one of the town criers in his stylish yellow and pink armour.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Turien Di Furza Letter to Turien Di Furza, from 
Larinne Kerendova.<br>
Turien Di Furza sorts through the stack of paperwork, checking that it all in 
order.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Turien Di Furza tells you, &quot;This paperwork seems in order. 
Though, why she is selling Thrungus is beyond me.&quot;<br>
Turien Di Furza tells you, &quot;Here, give her this letter. She'll need to send it 
with whomever she sends to pick up the next batch of those little things...&quot;<br>
</font><br>
To Holtburg next, and you may remember Renald the Eldest from such starter 
quests as the Trade Routes quest that runs out of Sanamar. He was a little more 
helpful this time.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Renald the Eldest Letter to Renald the Eldest, 
from Larinne Kerendova.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Another shipment of Ursuin 
toys, eh? She goes through these awful fast. Well, either that, or the little 
Ursuin do...&quot;<br>
Renald the Eldest tells you, &quot;Here, bring her this response. I'll ship those 
toys to her directly.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Renald the Eldest gives you Renald the Eldest's Reply.</font><br>
<br>
May'ad ibn Ibsar can be found, as is true of so many NPCs, in the pub in Yaraq 
only a short stroll from the lifestone.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Ma'yad ibn Ibsar Letter to May'ad ibn Ibsar, from 
Larinne Kerendova.<br>
May'ad ibn Ibsar reads the scroll.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Ma'yad ibn Ibsar tells you, &quot;So, Ms. Kerendova needs 
another shipment of Enchanted Sand for hatching Armoredillos. Very well, I'll 
have this sent along right away.&quot;<br>
Ma'yad ibn Ibsar tells you, &quot;Here, give her this invoice for the sand, so she is 
prepared when my delivery arrives to her.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Ma'yad ibn Ibsar gives you May'ad ibn Ibsar's Reply.</font><br>
<br>
And so to the last letter and Nen Ai, otherwise known as the lady with the pet 
drudge from the Shoushi starter quest. She's a little further out of town than 
the others, in a cottage just off the road to the southwest.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Nen Ai Letter to Nen Ai, from Larinne Kerendova.<br>
Nen Ai carefully takes and reads the scroll.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Nen Ai tells you, &quot;Oh my, more food for the little 
Drudges? I hope she is giving them to good homes.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Nen Ai pens a response for Larinne Kerendova.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Nen Ai tells you, &quot;Here, give her this letter and tell her 
I'll happily make up another batch of food for her little Drudges.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Nen Ai gives you Nen Ai's Reply.<br>
</font><br>
Back to the pet shop to hand Larinne the responses.<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Larinne Kerendova Renald the Eldest's Reply.<br>
You tell Larinne Kerendova about your interaction with Renald the Eldest, and 
tell her what he said.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Thank you. With the toys 
Renald carves for me, we've been able to raise the Ursuin to be much more gentle 
than they would be normally.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Hurry back with the responses from the others. 
Thanks again!&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Larinne Kerendova Nen Ai's Reply.<br>
You tell Larinne Kerendova about your interaction with Nen Ai, and tell her what 
she said.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Great! The Drudge Chow she 
makes is second to none! Her experience with raising and caring for Drudges is 
unmatched, and what she has learned of their care and training is what makes it 
possible to keep them as pets at all.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Hurry back with the responses from the others. 
Thanks again!&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Larinne Kerendova May'ad ibn Ibsar's Reply.<br>
You tell Larinne Kerendova about your interaction with May'ad ibn Ibsar, and 
tell her what was said.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Beautiful! With that 
shipment of enchanted sand, we'll be able to hatch another batch of Armoredillo 
Eggs.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Hurry back with the responses from the others. 
Thanks again!&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You tell Larinne Kerendova about your interaction with 
Turien Di Furza, and tell her what he said.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Excellent. With that 
paperwork filed, I'll be able to get another shipment of baby Thrungus 
delivered.&quot;<br>
Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;This is the final response needed, thank you! Now, 
you've earned this token, so here you go.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Larinne Kerendova gives you Baby Pet Token.</font><br>
<br>
The token can be handed to any of the four vendors to receive a cuddly little 
monster all of your own! The vendor will give you an egg, a kennel or a crate 
which you can use to summon and unsummon your new pet. These are givable, 
provided the pet is unsummoned, and have a value of zero. I spoke to Larinne 
once more, to see if there was anything else.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Larinne Kerendova tells you, &quot;Thank you again for your 
help. The supplies requested with those letters should last me about a week. If 
you come back in a week, I may have more work for you, and another token for you 
if you complete it.&quot;<br>
</font><br>
Looks like I'll have to wait a week for a drudge to play with my ursuin.<br>
<br>
Lots of pictures of pets attached, with and without stats. I would have included 
one of Larinne, but couldn't see her for the crowd of people all handing in 
letters!<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
