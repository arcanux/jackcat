<span lang="en-us">Tekapuapuh's Putiputi and fetched him his onga, you already 
know that beneath the surface of Dereth, Olthoi grubs are crawling rampant! The 
Subterranean Farms beneath Martine's Retreat have likewise been affected. Grubs, 
Olthoi, Rats and other vermin are destroying the crops! It seems one of the 
farmhands, a fellow named Harker, got Simulcra-ized and is weaking havoc with 
his Subtle friends! Kill Harker and return his head and you will be rewarded 
with either Sunstone (for Levels 60+) or Opal Guantlets (For Levels 59 and 
below). You can also use a <a href="RuinedAmulets.htm">
Ruined Amulet</a> on the Sunstone Gauntlets to imbue them with a moderate weapon 
spell.</span></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin the 
quest, head to Martine's Retreat in Rithwic at 10.6N, 58.3E. As the town crier 
mentions, seek out Hibdin Velos in Martine's Throne room (head straight at the 
drop and up the ramp). Ambrosia Roe, standing outside the door, guides you to 
Hibdin. </font></span></p>

<font color="#FFFF99">Ambrosia Roe 
tells you, &quot;Things have begun to quiet down thankfully. But there are stirrings 
from the deeper areas of the Retreat. Hibdin knows more about it than I do. I'm 
content simply watching for now. I'm just glad that I am free of Gaerlan's mind 
control.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial" size="2">Hibdin Velos 
tells you, &quot;Hello friend. We've fallen on some hard times here in Martine's 
Retreat. With Martine being gone for so long, we can only surmise that he is 
indeed dead. But that is the least of our problems.&quot;<br>
Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;About two weeks ago Remmick, our head farmer, came up 
from the subterranean farm and said that it was madness down there. It seems 
that a farm hand named Harker had become... touched.&quot;<br>
Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;If you wouldn't mind helping us out with getting some 
of the food and maybe killing Harker, we'd be in your debt. I'd pay you 
handsomely.&quot;<br>
Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Before you go, you might want to speak to Remmick. He 
might have some pointers for you.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">As Hibdin Velos suggests, go back 
downstairs and speak to Remmick. He tells you that not only is the place overrun 
with grubs, but Harker now has a pack of hooligans with him!</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
<font color="#FFFF99" face="Arial" size="2">Remmick tells you, &quot;Everything is falling apart. I can't get crops anymore, and 
without those crops then everyone here will starve, or be forced to move back to 
the surface. But most don't want that. They'd rather live out their lives here.&quot;<br>
Remmick tells you, &quot;If only we could get rid of Harker! The farm has never been 
truly safe. Rats, wasps, even Olthoi have been known to peek their heads in from 
time to time.&quot;<br>
Remmick tells you, &quot;The worst were the grubs, though. Hundreds of them at times. 
They're small enough to smash outright sure... but they're more a threat to the 
harvest.&quot;<br>
Remmick tells you, &quot;If you're going down there, be prepared... One more thing: 
Harker has a bundle of hooligans who traffic with him now. You watch your back 
down there, you hear?&quot;<br>
Remmick tells you, &quot;Go talk to Hibdin, he's the one organizing the expeditions 
down there.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
<font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">The entrance to the Subterranean 
Farms is restricted to Levels 20+ and cannot be summoned or recalled. You'll 
find the portal right next to Martine's Study portal (down the left hall from 
the entrance).</font></span></p>

<font face="Arial" style="font-size: smaller">Once inside you'll pass through 
rooms of various crops: cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, whatever that plant is that 
grows on Marae Lassel.... As Remmick said, disgusting little grubbies (Level 18) 
are everywhere! And they're not the only pests. You'll also have to work you way 
through <a href="../../Pets/olthoi.htm">Olthoi</a> Slaves 
(Level 44), Silver <a href="../../Pets/rat.htm">Rats</a>

from it. Head through and you'll see the final room where Harker, a level 95
<a href="../../Pets/simulacra.htm">Simulacra</a>, and his 
Subtle Simulacra (Level 61) friends await. Kill Harker and loot his head (no-give). He'll 
also be carrying a virindi shard.<br>

</span>
<font color="#66FF99">You cleave Harker in twain!<br>
Harker tells you, &quot;A shell is nothing more than a device that allows us to 
traffic amongst your ilk. This body will return with me as its host. Our lives 
are eternal thanks to Aerbax&quot;<br>
<br>

</font>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Joxer T Mighty of SC reports that 
Harker will spawn either with an xbow, or alternatively with a sword and 
Simulacra Shield. Melee attacks. No type of melee attack appears to be more 
effective, but life bolts seem to work rather well. The final room is also a 
great place to collect some gemstone salvages (7+).<br>
<br>
Take the head and return to Hibdin Velos.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
He'll give you a pair of Gauntlets as a reward! Levels 60 or above receive 
Sunstone. Levels 59 and below will get Opal Ga<span lang="en-us">u</span>ntlets. Hibdin will also direct 
you to Leandra for information on how to enhance your gauntlets!<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">You give Hibdin Velos Harker's Head.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;Well, it looks like you've done pretty well down there. 
I've got a reward for your efforts--it's only fair that we give you something. 
You have, after all, returned the productivity to the farm for the time being.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#66FF99">Hibdin Velos gives you Sunstone Gauntlets.<br>
</font><font color="#FFFF99">Hibdin Velos tells you, &quot;If you show these to Leandra she might be able to

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Leandra is located in the lower 
level of Martine's Retreat. Take the ramp down on the south wall, directly to 
the west of the ramp to the throne room. When you let Leandra examine the

Ruined Amulet</a> (the amulet, not the potion) on the Sunstone Gauntlets to 
imbue them with a moderate Weapon

would ever see. Now what was it that he said about them...&quot;<br>
Leandra tells you, &quot;Ah yes! He said that with the right insignia, we'd be able 
to infuse the gauntlets with a fairly potent cantrip.&quot;</font></font></p>
