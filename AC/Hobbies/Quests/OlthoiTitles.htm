      bring it up, but it seems as though the townspeople have thought of me as 
      the renowned Olthoi Slayer. I have tried to explain to them that you are 
      the one doing all the killing, but they don't seem to understand that. Now 
      they expect me to go kill off a nest of Olthoi supersoldiers! We call them 
      Olthoi Legionaries, and they are quite terrifying, from what I am given to 
      understand. Well, not so terrifying to one such as you, eh? They have 
      taken over an ancient Empyrean grotto, kill them, return a pincer as proof 
      to me, and I shall shower you with riches.&quot;</font></font></span></p>
