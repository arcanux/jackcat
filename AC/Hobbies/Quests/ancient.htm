Darhy, Assistant to Nuhmudira at 13.1N, 0.8E in Zaikhal.</span></font><p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Darhy, 
Assistant to Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I am glad you survived the journey here. I am 
here on behalf of Nuhmudira who labors to find a means to combat the olthoi 
menace. Nuhmudira has determined there is an unknown force that seems to drown 
out mana and suppresses higher forms of magic. This force is particularly 
powerful in the proximity of the ancient Olthoi Queen's lair and prevents anyone 
from being portalled successfully there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Darhy, Assistant to Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Whispering Venom crystal is required 
to nullify this effect--the wearing of a ring made from this very rare crystal 
would allow one to portal to the Queen's lair. Alas, Nuhmudira did posess a 
supply of these crystals however they were stolen some time ago from her 
warehouse, together with numerous other crystals. While the other crystal types 
are being replaced through the good efforts of Isparians, a supply of Whispering 
Venom crystal is lacking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Darhy, Assistant to Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;There is a mine at desert's edge, west 
of Khayyaban, which used to be a source of these crystals. It may be somewhat 
depleted but it is our only hope. Please try to find some and return as soon as 
you are able!&quot;</font></span></font></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, head to 
<a href="../../dungeon.asp-placeID=11106.html">Crystal Mines</a>

quarters portal out of Mayoi at 61.8S, 81.6E). The Crystal Mines may not be 
summoned, recalled or link and has no level restriction. Inside you'll be

<font color="#66FF99">You give Hiyp the Toad Hiyp the Toad's pickaxe. <br>
Hiyp The Toad looks at you with a sodden expression </font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Hiyp the Toad tells you, &quot;Hey, that's my best pickaxe! I 
must have left it down in the, ummm, where was that... oh yeah there was that 
mine, I was tryin' to get some of those crystals them's in Zaikhal wanted. Maybe 
it'll help with the bugs, maybe not. Well, there's nothing in that mine, I'll 
tell ya. So I said to myself, forget it, go have a drink. You trying to get some 
too? Hmmm, I just may know someone who can get some. There's a jeweler, name of 
Djusufa bint Huqis, she's in Zaikhal. I know her a while, she told me something 
interesting. One night a woman came to her and handed her a strange crystal, 
wondered if she knew what it was good for. The jeweler, she didn't know, never 
seen one like that before. She said she'd have to ask around, maybe check with 
one of Nuhmudira's people. Well, this woman gets all nervous and just leaves. 
Anyway, that's all I know. Go see Djusufa bint Huqis.&quot; </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">As Hiyp the Toad instructs, 
head back to Zaikhal and speak with Djusufa bint Huqis, the Jeweler.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Djusufa bint Huqis the Jeweler tells you, &quot;So, Hiyp told 
you to talk to me about Whispering Venom crystal. Yes, that is correct, it was a 
dark and stormy night when this woman came banging on my shop door even though I 
had just closed. She seemed to be rather nervous but needed to know about a 
crystal, which she handed to me. She wanted to understand what it may be used 
for. I examined it carefully for I had never seen one like it before. It's 
purpose or potential eluded me and I said to her that I would have to inquire 
with one of the scholars working with Nuhmudira about it. She became very 
agitated then and ran out the door. I tried to go after her to return the 
crystal but she was gone.&quot; </font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99"><br>
Djusufa bint Huqis the Jeweler tells you, &quot;I remembered 
later that I had seen her about town and that she was in fact one of Nuhmudira's 
students. Not wanting to cause trouble for her I inquired discreetly and found 
out she was originally from somewhere northeast of Samsur. Eventually I brought 
the crystal to one of Nuhmudira's other students and he said he believed it was 
Whispering Venom crystal. I allowed him to keep it and that was that. So, I do 
not have the crystal now. Had I known so many would be seeking such crystal 
these days I might have made a tidy sum selling it!&quot; </font></span></font></p>

lesson. If you keep my location here a secret, I will tell you where some of 
those crystals may be found. Take this small journal. I wrote it in case ...

    in order that they might be poisoned! The assault against the Queen began!</font></span></p>

    about, Nuhmudira raises her voice in an effort to bring about order. &quot;We 
    stand at the abyss, childern. Here on the threshold of the Olthoi Queen's 
    lair, the place where she means to cultivate her new brood. The seat from 
    where she would rule. Here is where the tide is driven back and she is 
    stricken from this land. Here also is the place that we end the presence of 
    their race!<br>
    <br>
    &quot;For nearly 15 years we have lived with the memory of oppressive rule and 
    the horror of the olthoi pits. We now have a chance to kill those memories 
    and drive the shadow of those times from our minds. Beneath us, through the 
    festering cloulds of acid, are eggs. Otlhoi breeding vats, wherein the grubs 
    that would one day grow to maturity, and rise to threaten our people are 
    nutured.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;These eggs must be crushed. But in doing so you will ire the Queen, and 
    draw her here. This must be done. I will begin my ritus, and when she has 
    arrived I will harness her mind and join with it.&quot;</font></p>

    &quot;The most potent warriors of Dereth should leap within that pit and stand 
    off against this Queen. Others may attempt this feat but it is unlikely that 
    you will survive. While I do my best to weaken her form, she is still going 
    to prove to be a menace as great as any we have faced.&quot;</font></p>

    yet seasoned enough to roam the Direlands to stay with me. you will be 
    needed to poison the food stores. When they are unguarded, I will open 
    portals to the stores and send you through to place the poison on the 
    stockpile. There are four nests, from that I have been able to find. Each 
    have guardians that we must force the Queen to call upon.&quot;</font></p>

    your strength of arms, arrow and spell will be needed more below. We will 
    not fail this, children.&quot;<br>

    Nuhmudira nearly stumbles, as if struck by a mighty blow. Her voice is

    be slain, but we can draw them away from the fight against those within the 
    pit.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira groans and speaks in an almost dual-toned voice, &quot;A portal, to 
    their...next food source. Quickly, through the portal, the defenders need 
    our assistance. Bring the poison through.&quot; </font></font></span></p>

    Sensing the failure of her guardians, the Ancient Queen stirs and makes her 
    way to the breeding hive. <br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira speaks in a frightening voice, &quot;My children, they have poisoned 
    the food my children, I can smell it now, it seeps everywhere through my 
    breeding hive. The little ones assail me from all sides. I demand the same 
    of you. Rise through the surface of their world, strike them down so that 
    they may become the host for our food.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira howls in pain and crumples to the ground, her voice taking on the 
    shrill aspect it once had, &quot;You cannot keep my children from me. They will 
    feel my mind again and then shall we revisit upon you, the suffering you 
    have inflicted upon me.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Blood swells from the corner of Nuhmudira's eyes. As the blood tears cascade 
    down her cheeks, a shrill noise shudders across the world. &quot;My children, 
    no!&quot; Nuhmudira's face contorts into a grim visage, the wounds across her 
    body begin to heal. As she begins speaking, her voice takes on the sound of 
    hundreds of voices singing in perfect harmony and unison. &quot;Your reign is 
    done here. Your children have abandoned you, betraying your will because of 
    your hubris. You are defeated.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    As [Player Name] prevails, the Olthoi Queen retreats into the darkness, she 
    pulls the walls of the tunnel down behind her. The sound of crumbling stone 
    can be heard echoing through the chamber. </font> </font></span>

    The singing begins to subside, though the voices can be heard, still echoing 
    through the caves. <br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira's voice is shaky and hoarse, the look upon her face is distant as 
    though she cannot see what is around her. &quot;We have won... The Olthoi Queen 
    is driven from this land, and we will not see her, perhaps ever. She knows 
    fear.&quot; Nuhmudira groans, &quot;I am sorry...the ordeal...&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Nuhmudira lifts her head slightly. &quot;Our victory is complete. The olthoi will 
    not return to this hive and the queens that are left behind have already 
    begun to divide their hordes. Despite our efforts to eradicate their 
    species, we must remain vigilant against the Olthoi. Her will was strong 
    enough to warn them of our poisoning their foods.&quot; </font></span></p>

    The note grows in intensity and swallows all other sound in the cavern. The 
    language is unknown and the sound is melancholy, though eerily beautiful.

    Nuhmudira leaves the final hive without flourish. As she disappears a fell

    slowly dissipates and is swallowed by the sound of the wind. </font><br>
