<span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Throughout the month's event 
Bleeargh, a dev controlled mosswart, would appear in towns seeking to trade for 
salvage. His appearance would usually precede one of the Burun attacks. If you 
spoke with Bleeargh and traded with him, you could receive a Mosswart Thanking 
Stone along with other random items he may have been carrying. If you then gave 
the Thanking Stone to
Aun Loakhe, you would receive a Diplomat Token for a title!</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">After completing your trade, 
Bleeargh would become agitated and warn about the &quot;smellies&quot; coming. Shortly 
thereafter, a burun invasion would spawn!</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">If you attacked and killed 
Bleeargh instead, a global message would spawn: &quot;[town name] is the target of 
the next burun attack&quot; a few minutes after his death.</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Sadly, Bleeargh seldom 
survived his visits to town or the attacks of the &quot;Smellies&quot;. A second stone, 
the Mosswart Mourning Stone, could be found on his corpse.</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">A third type of trophy, a 
Burun Idol, dropped from the leader of the Burun attacks. Its corpse would 
contain up to 5 of the idols. When given to
Aun Loakhe, the idols lost their Dropped on Death property. Currently, their 
only known use is as a hooked housing item. (All three stones become giveable 
after they have been turned in to Aun Loakhe.)</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Below are two tales of

<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Hello Maggie, <br>
First off let me tell you I really like your site.
Anyways, today I was in Hebian-To, at the blacksmith buying things, few people 
were around. I heard someone say &quot;Nice Isparian help Beeragghhh?&quot; I turned around 
and it was a level 95 mosswart. He talked like a normal player (obviously admin controlled).
</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">I said hi and he keep saying things like 
&quot;The smelly things are coming.&quot; and &quot;Can you, helpful Isparian, give me wood and 
cloths for family?, they destroyed all of it.&quot; I went up to him and asked him 
&quot;What exactly do you need?&quot; </font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">He said, &quot;I need clothes and wood for family&quot; I said 
&quot;ok lemme go to tailor&quot;. He said &quot;Isparian clothes wont fit me!&quot; Then he said &quot;I 
need materials to make them&quot;. <br>
<br>
Salvage! I thought. &quot;uuh salvage?&quot; He replied, &quot;Yes! Yes! We's heard that word 
before That's the word Isparians use for building!&quot;
&quot;yes&quot;<br>
I replied. &quot;I have some granite, iron, Mahogany and some steel.&quot; &quot;Maaaaa-hogany? 
is that wood?&quot; <br>
&quot;yes&quot; <br>
&quot;You will trade?<br>
&quot;I give you things and the shiny shiny [pyreals] you gave me eairler&quot;<br>
He opened trade, in it he put a celdon girth (nothing special), the pyreals, I 
gave him earlier, and a &quot;Burun thanking stone.&quot; We traded my 97 units of hog 
*cry* *cry* for those items. <br>
&quot;You helpful nice Isparian!&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you, family will be happy&quot;<br>
&quot;uh-oh, smelly things are coming!&quot;<br>
&quot;Ahhhh! Help me protect me!<br>
[Burun Invasion army spawned]<br>
&quot;HELP!&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Well I had my raiment on, so I was doomed. I was dead in a couple 
of minutes, while he 
ran in the archmage room. Strangely ALL of the burun were after him, and were 
clogging the door. I killed a couple but then I died. Luckily, Hebian-To was my lifestone. When I respawned, all I heard was &quot;Ouch!&quot; then...<br>
<br>
&quot;The force of burun killer nearly turns bleeeagh inside out!&quot;<br>
<br>
2 seconds later...<br>
<br>
The invasion was stopped by a mage that had just come. I ran to the archmage's and, 
no body.<br>
<br>
The stone says to give it to scribe in Arwic so here I go.</font></span></p>

Bleeargh the mosswart visited Hebian-to this afternoon searching for cloth and 
wood to build new homes for his people. Below is a text of most of his speech. 
Unfortunately, Bleeargh was killed by some misguided fools.<br>

Bleeargh says, &quot;Burun! That name of big nasty that drive Mosswarts out of 
swamp!&quot;<br>
<font color="#FFCC00">[Allegiance] Benodach says, &quot;did someone give him what he wants?&quot;</font><br>

You say, &quot;we must close the door they come thru&quot;<br>
Bleeargh says, &quot;There is place in swamp where they first appear, many Mosswarts 
die. I seen many Isparians go to that place before I leave swamp.&quot;<br>
Bleeargh sniffs the air again.<br>
Lowde says, &quot;I don't know about you but i have a priminition they will be around 
for a long long long time&quot;<br>
You say, &quot;yes we have been there many times the portals of the falatacot the old

On the night of May 14th, at approx. 7:00-7:30 PM EDT the Burun once again 
attacked. A global appeared:<br>
<br>
<font color="#66FF99">Burun forces have invaded the cities of Hebian-To, Sawato, and Shoushi!</font><br>
<br>
Shortly after, another global (which I didn't get a copy of) stated that the 
Burun forces were massing in a crater West of Sawato, which happened to be the 
town I was running to.<br>
<br>
When we got to the crater (26.4S, 51.4E), we found it to be completely filled 
with Burun Shaman, Soothsayers, and a few other high level types of Burun.<br>
<br>
The leader was a Burun Ruuk Shaman that looked just like any other Shaman in the 
crater. At 7:41 PM EDT on Morningthaw, I landed the kill :)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps - I've included a screenshot of the chaos/kill at the crater. 
It really was a sight to see!<br>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie, <br>
Calis of Krondor from 
WE reporting back in. I thought to snag a screen this time around when the Burun 
showed up in Shoushi on WE tonight. The leader's name is Jorgluuk. He does indeed drop 5 idols and some random junk. My mage, Mage Milamber, got the kill on him and saved the town! lol<br>
<br>
Just wanted to get you an id at least, couldn't get a good shot while he was 
alive, sorry heh too much going on. Still no clue what to do with the idol after 
it's been turned in. Love the site and keep up the great work!</font></span></p>

leader of the Burun incursion in Shoushi!<br>

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the afternoon on, I believe, 
the 2nd of June, on the Harvestgain server, I saw in green letters a simple 
message pretty close to &quot;Sawato is the subject of a Burun raid!&quot; I rushed to the 
subway and asked my monarchy if they knew the way to Sawato. Run, they said. So 
about 10 minutes later(maybe 15-20, not sure) I arrive at Sawato. Just outside 
of town I see a Burun. I ignore it and charge in to help about a dozen other 
players kill off a meager supply of Burun. A few minutes later I see a message 
close to &quot;<font color="#66FF99">can't remember his name) has slain the leader of the Burun raid.</font>&quot; I 
get a chance to loot a corpse and find a Burun Idol. It says, the idol 
description, that the Tumerok in Arwic 
might know what it is. So I hang around a few minutes, then head to Arwic. I 
find the tumerok I'm looking for on top of the tallest tower and give him the 
idol. He says he doesn't know what it is and gives it back :-/</font></span></p>
