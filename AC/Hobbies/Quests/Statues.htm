    Bhab, Arcanum Tinkerer tells you, &quot;The Arcanum's been 
    quite busy studying all the bronze weaponry found on those crazy statues. We 
    were hoping that if we found out how they were made, we'd be able to figure 
    out how to destroy them. And we were in quite a pickle, I tell you! Turns 
    out we were barking up the wrong tree all along. Asheron stopped by our 
    workshop one day and gave us a little talking to. Told us a little bit about 
    Empyrean transmutation magic from the old days of yore! Here's the 
    secret--Asheron taught us how to create this thinga-ma-bob called an Etheric 
    Seal. You plant it in a statue's pedestal, and it'll do a number on the 
    stone--try it and you'll see!&quot;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>

    more than meets the eye underneath those statues--maybe it'll even lead to 
    the place where they're being created! What's more, I've got a little theory 
    I've been working on. These statues...well, there must be an original from 
    which they've been molded, right? If you found the native cast and managed 
    to destroy it...I'll bet you it'll have some kind of effect on the rest. If 
    you find anything in there, bring it to me for a looksee--I can't get enough 
    of tinkering!&quot;</font></font></p>
