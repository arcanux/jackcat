	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Dakmor Kavu of HG sends these details: &quot;Hey Maggie! Here 
	are some more goodies from the patch that I thought you and your fans might 
	enjoy :-P<br>
	<br>
	Torgash &amp; Kalakh (NPCs)&nbsp; - 94.0N by 45.9W</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Talk to Torgash to Recieve the message:<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">A chill passes through your body, numbing you to the 
	core. For a single moment, you feel like you're going to die from the 
	sensation alone. The Ruschk opens his mouth; his speech comes out in but a 
	whisper... &quot;[player name]&quot;<br>
	In your mind, the following information becomes apparent to you. The Ruchk 
	standing before you wishes you to kill 30 of the Viamontian Knights in the 
	valley below. Once this is complete, he wishes you to retrieve a vial from 
	the westernmost Knight Encampment in the valley, near 93.5N, 51.4W. You get 
	the impression that the vial is in a small building, toward the back of the 
	encampment.<br>
	</font><br>
	Upon completion of the task:<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">The Ruschk looks greatly pleased. He presses his right 
	fist into his left hand and bows to you. The Rushk then looks at you 
	quizzically, seeming to wonder if you wished to hunt more knights.<br>
	You have earned 8,700,000 experience.</font> (Level 247)</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial">Timer: none <br>
	<br>
	Talk to Kalakh to recieve the message:<br>
	<font color="#66FF99">The Ruschk looks you up and down, like he is gauging 
	your strength. With a nod of approval, he stares into your eyes, and with a 
	wash of deathly cold, the following information becomes apparent in your 
	mind:<br>
	The Ruschk wishes you to enter the Temple of the Black Spear, located at 
	95.5N, 51.8W, and retrieve a small totem, important to the followers of 
	Grael. Once you bring the totem back to him, he will reward you for your 
	strength.<br>
	</font><br>
	The dungeon is 130+ to enter, neither tieable nor recall able. Its filled 
	with Mukkir and Rushk, which get progressively tougher, with Shadows 
	appearing later on. When you get down to the room with the surface portal, 
	keep going down past. Room with totem is a little ways on.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="arial"><font color="#66FF99">You give Kalakh Black Spear Ice 
	Totem.<br>
	The Ruschk looks at the Totem with obvious contempt, and drops it 
	unceremoniously in his pouch. Then, with a look which seems to beam with 
	pride, he claps you on the back. With obvious effort, he speaks in a barely 
	audible whisper.</font><br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Kalakh tells you, &quot;Well... Done.&quot;</font><br>
	<font color="#66FF99">The Ruschk, Kalakh, awards you the title of &quot;Friend to 
	the Frostglaive.&quot;<br>
	You've earned 29,175,980 experience</font><br>
	<br>
	Much thanks again to Yeti Ginsu for the company and much appreciated 
	firepower on the quest!&quot;</font></p>

	<p>Ninavie and Zegeger of HG report: </p>
	<p>Run from eastwatch, two npc's at 93.2N 48.2W.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Arialle du Bellenesse tells you, &quot;Greetings. If you 
	have the time, I have a mission that you may be interested in. To the 
	northwest, at 95.5N, 51.8W , there is a Temple to that accursed Grael. 
	Inside, the Ruschk seem to have created a Totem capable of empowering Grael 
	himself.&quot;<br>
	Arialle du Bellenesse tells you, &quot;This Totem cannot be allowed to stay in 
	their possession. They could possibly even use such a thing to overcome the 
	splitting of Grael into Aspects, and we'd have to battle a fully empowered 
	Grael, all over again.&quot; <br>
	Arialle du Bellenesse tells you, &quot;Retrieve this Totem for me, so we can seek 
	a way to prevent these from aiding Grael, as well as removing it from their 
	possession, and I will reward you for your efforts.<br>
	</font><br>
	Temple of the Black Spear, restricted to level 130+<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FFFF99">Commander Rylane di Cinghalle tells you, &quot;Greetings. 
	If you have the time, I have a set of tasks you could aid me with. I'm here 
	to help thin out the number of Ruschk in the valley below, and to gain one 
	of their Totems for further study.&quot; <br>
	Commander Rylane di Cinghalle tells you, &quot;If you were to kill, say... 30 of 
	the Ruschk in the valley, and then acquire one of their smaller Ice Totems 
	from the encampment at 95.5N, 42.3W, I'd be more than happy to reward you 
	for your efforts.&quot; <br>
	Commander Rylane di Cinghalle tells you, &quot;I'd kill the Ruschk first. That 
	should throw them into enough disarray that you should be able to grab the 
	Totem unnoticed.&quot;</font></p>
