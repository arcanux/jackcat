reports:<br>
    Asheron's tower can be reached via the portal in the Matron's Hive on south 
    Island. From the Nanto portal drop, run left with the shore on your left and 
    you should find it. The portal to West island is at the bottom of the 
    Matron's Hive, but it isn't for the weak hearted...Olhoi swarm eviscerators, 
    mutilators, guardians, warriors and nobles abound.<br>
    <br>
    When you get to West Island head for the big mountain thing, Asheron's Tower 
    is on the top. This run is *very* scary...imagine your worst nightmare then 
    add Jerry Springer.<br>
    <br>
    When you get to the base of the mountain the only thing you can do is run 
    around it till you find a way up....with half the Olthoi in the world trying 
    to stop you.<br>
    <br>
    There is a plateau half way up where you can rest that is relatively Olthoi 
    free...well compared to everywhere else.<br>
    <br>
    When you get to Asheron's tower you will find a portal to the Inner 
    Sanctum...take it...you'll find Asheron and his Guardians...(Don't forget to 
    take pics...great eye candy)...talk to asheron and he'll tell you that some 
    800 year old hive matron has returned and give you a book.<br>
    <br>
    The book is 30 pages long so I haven't read it yet...if you want to know 
    what's inside, go talk to Asheron :).<br>
    <br>
    Have fun, and remember...be careful out there :).<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Asheron tells you, &quot;Welcome. I 
    had never thought that I would see Isparians here, aside from Elysa and 
    Borelean. But I see that you have made your way across my island and through 
    the Olthoi Hordes.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;I have fashioned this book to explain everything that I 
    know at this time about the resurgence of the Olthoi. I am indebted to you 
    once more for your actions.&quot; <br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Asheron gives you Olthoi 
    Resurgent. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;I am not quite sure what caused them to come here, but I 
    am quite sure that it relates directly to the evidence turned up at Knorr.&quot;
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;Oh yes, I am well aware that you have been making your 
    way through my familial estate; while I am not happy about your intrusion 
    there, this world is as much yours as it is mine now.&quot; <br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Asheron smirks. </font>
    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;I am however, all too well aware of Nuhmudira and her 
    quest for more power. She plays with primal forces that are far beyond her 
    frame to contain. In some respects, I pity her for her madness; in others, I 
    revile her for the selfish manner in which she acts.&quot; <br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#66FF99">Asheron pauses looking to 
    his guardians. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;I had assumed that the Queen at Knorr was not eternal. 
    But this invasion has caused me to re-assess that assumption. It has been 
    nearly 800 years since I have seen that Queen.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;If she has come, then we shall need to band together as 
    never before. I could not use the full power of my magical arsenal while 
    those creatures were here. There was something potent that drained the 
    higher magics from the area. Now I feel them back again. You have helped to 
    restore me...now we need to assist ourselves.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;This Queen...is the most terrible thing that this world 
    or any other has ever seen. What is worse is that she remembers, and in that 
    memory she undoubtedly is stalking me...but when she learns that her 
    children have suffered so much at our hands, her attentions will be cast 
    toward us all.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Guardian tells you, &quot;We are here at the behest of Lord Asheron. Our duty is 
    to maintain peace. We ask that you observe our requests so as to not force 
    our hands into action.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    Asheron tells you, &quot;There is nothing more that I can tell you at this time. 
    I must reflect upon what has transpired and devise a way to deal with this 
    menace. It will require the efforts of us all if this is indeed the same 
    Queen.&quot;</font></span></p>
