    Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;I cannot waste the final poison on this task, so I 
    rely on you to find a means for spreading the lesser poisons we have 
    collected. If we can find a substance that will attract her brood to the 
    poison I believe it will kill them -- or at the very least drive them from 
    the surface once and for all.&quot;<br>
    Nuhmudira tells you, &quot;Spread out and search for this substance. I have many 
    things to attend to, and must concentrate on the greater battle to come.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
<br>
Here is a partial writeup on the new olthoi quest.<br>
<br>
As you know, Nuhmudira appeared in Zaikhal. First we found the Lugian Encampment 
at 17.1N, 4.8W. There was a &quot;Renegade's Pack&quot; laying on the ground, and after we 
double clicked on it, we each got a &quot;Letter to General Garsh&quot; and a book called 
&quot;Travel Log&quot;.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#00FF99">
You reach into the pack and rummage through the papers.<br>
You find an important looking letter and worn book.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Additional attempt 
messages:<br>
<font color="#00FF99">You find a little green lump of putty and drop it in 
disgust.<br>
Wait, you think you feel the point of a powerful weapon!<br>
No, just a quill.<br>
You can find nothing else of interest in the pack.<br>
You receive a paper-cut while shuffling through the pack.<br>
You find a small scrap of folded paper. It reads: I don't trust Maloth, he would 
trade his own mother for a chance at advancement. Please, reconsider his 
promotion.</font><br>

<br>
Travel log was 6 pages, and was quite funny.<br>
<br>
After this, we rushed off to the Renegade Garrison (44.3N, 51.9E -- Levels 40+). 
We were now flagged to enter.</font></span></p>

Mountain Pass portal in Arwic at 35.0N, 56.0E. You'll exit at 41.0N, 56.0E.<br>
<br>
We spoke to the Lugian inside, let him read the letter and the log, and then 
bribed him with a trade note to let us enter. (Trade note must be M note or 
above.)</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#00FF99">You give Sergeant Maloth Pyreal.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Thank you, but I prefer paper. 
Here, take it back.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth looks astonishingly like someone trying to look innocent.</font></font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant 
Maloth tells you, &quot;Wha! Humans! Leave now and you may yet live!&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#00FF99">Sergeant Maloth looks you over. His eyes focus on your 
weapons and jewelry. He glances about the room for a moment.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Perhaps I was too hasty my 
friend.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Many days ago, our engineers broke into an olthoi 
tunnel while excavating the lower sections of this garrison. We fought them, and 
lost all but the top level beyond this door, which I was ordered to guard until 
reinforcements arrive.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Unfortunately, I have fallen on hard times and could 
not possibly consider jeopardizing my career by ignoring my ranking officer's 
orders. If only I could somehow be assured of your intentions...&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;I suppose you could bring me 
proof of your defeat of the olthoi below... if I had proof of their defeat, I 
could assure a promotion... But no, I cannot make a deal so risky without a 
little something to fall back on in case it were to fail.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">You allow Sergeant Maloth to examine your Letter to 
General Garsh.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Ah, so they didn't survive the 
journey... Put it away.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Remember, I never saw that letter.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#00FF99">You allow Sergeant Maloth to examine your Travel Log.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Hah, the fool, writing down 
directions to our secret garrison. I'm glad he's gone, less competition for me, 
hahaha.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">You give Sergeant Maloth Trade Note (150,000).<br>
Sergeant Maloth swiftly reaches out and the tradenote disappears.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth says, &quot;Ah, I see that you intend to help 
us and that I, a loyal Gotrok, would be lax in my duties did I not allow 
creatures of such obvious honor to assist us in our hour of need.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;You must not forget that I am taking a risk in 
allowing you entrance. Bring me back proof that you removed the olthoi menace 
from our garrison and I may have a small reward for you.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Also, my fellows within may not recognize you for 
the heroes that you are so be prepare to defend yourselves. If you can't handle 
them then you surely cannot handle the olthoi deeper down. If caught, remember 
to say that you got into the dungeon through portal magic.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Oh, If I see you again I am sure I will not 
recognize you. You humans all look alike to me with your pointy noses and huge 
ears, haha! Thus, if you require entrance you will have to pay m... I mean 
donate towards our rebuilding efforts again.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once in, we fought olthoi all the 
way down until we cam to a Royal Guardian. It dropped a gland, which acted like 
a key to let us into the next section. We then reached the Young Olthoi Queen. 
Once she was defeated, she dropped 9 pieces of chitin on her corpse. Another 
door opened when she died, and inside was a corpse of an Olthoi Queen. When we 
double clicked the corpse, we got &quot;Royal Olthoi Jelly&quot;.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#00FF99">The Young Olthoi Queen screams and falls. An acrid smell 
fills the room and the door on the far wall squelches open.</font><br>
<br>
We portal recalled back to the start of dungeon, handed the chitin to the Lugian, 
and he gave us these:<br>
<br>
--5% of xp to next level<br>
--Renegade Mace<br>
--Renegade Pendant<br>
<br>
<br>
We then made our way to Zaikal, and handed the Royal Jelly to Nuhmudira. She 
then said (local message):</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<font color="#00FF99">You give Nuhmudira Royal Olthoi Jelly.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Nuhmudira tells you, “Hmmm, this may be what I was looking 
for… Yes, I remember that we used a foul smelling jelly much like this once 
before. This could very well make the poison more effective.”<br>
Nuhmudira tells you, “Please rest a moment while I test this jelly’s reaction 
with the poison.”</font><br>
<font color="#D6D2DD">Nuhmudira says, “Hmmm, the poison hasn’t degraded, a good 
sign.”<br>
Nuhmudira says, &quot;Well, here goes nothing.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#00FF99">Nuhmudira combines the Olthoi Royal Jelly with the 
poisons.<br>
A noxious green cloud sprays from the mixing bottle Nuhmudira holds. It expands 
quickly and seems to dissipate on the wind. </font><br>
<font color="#D6D2DD">Nuhmudira says, &quot;Relax, the poison only seems to affect 
Olthoi. We should be fine.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
[GLOBAL]<br>
<font color="#00FF99">An inhuman wail rises on a foul smelling wind. The Olthoi 
hordes are once again driven back underground thanks to the tireless efforts of 
Tigria in helping Nuhmudira create an aerial poison.</font> <br>
[/END GLOBAL]<br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">In the distance a high keened screech goes up. It sounds 
like an Olthoi in a great deal of pain. <br>
A tight lipped smile stretches across Nuhmudira's face.<br>
</font><br>
<font color="#D6D2DD">Nuhmudira says, &quot;So, the jelly was collected from a pool 
surrounding the husk of a dead queen? Then that is where they must have taken 
her...&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira says, &quot;Many years ago Elysa used a poison given to her by Asheron to 
kill the Olthoi Queen, or what we believed to be the true Olthoi Queen at the 
time. She shot the poisoned arrow into the Queen's right eye and killed her 
instantly. The remaining olthoi were confused and weak after having lost their
<br>
queen and we cut them down and took back Dereth for ourselves.&quot;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#D6D2DD">Nuhmudira says, &quot;My research seemed to point to the Black 
Death Catacombs as the place where Elysa launched the killing shot against the 
Olthoi Queen, but we were never able to find the body... until now. The olthoi 
must have dragged her remains to the cave where you found them. Perhaps they 
believed the Royal <br>
Jelly would spawn a new queen. Perhaps the Queen from Marae Lassel was created 
in this way. The Renegades must have accidentally broken into the chambers 
holding the olthoi's precious jelly and the olthoi attacked as though they were 
protecting their queen. Such stupid creatures.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuhmudira says, &quot;I must go now, I have many pressing matters that need my 
attention. Prepare yourselves, we shall soon make the maggot queen sorry she 
ever came to this world.&quot;<br>
</font>[Nuhmudira recalls.]<font color="#D6D2DD"><br>

<font color="#00FF99">Sergeant Maloth glances at your pendant, looks around for

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Fairouz of MT sends the following:<br>
Fight your way through the renegade Tumeroks and Lugians in the dungeon maze, 
heading east and south. When you reach a hallway heading southeast, you'll come 
upon a room with signs of a fresh slaughter. Tumerok, Lugian and Olthoi corpses 
litter the floor, accompanied by a few live bugs.<br>
<br>
A Reinforced Door blocks the path out of the room. Attack the door with melee, 
missile or magical attacks. Unlike the Gaerlan's Quest door, the Reinforced Door 
doesn't seem to have much ability to regenerate and will go down after 
approximately 2000 points of damage.<br>
<br>
You flatten Reinforced Door's body with the force of your assault!<br>
<br>
Beyond the door, continue fighting through Olthoi. Eventually, you will 
encounter Swarm Olthoi, including a Royal Olthoi Guardian around a locked Olthoi 
Door (Resistance: 999). The Royal Olthoi Guardian carries a Smelly Olthoi Gland, 
which may be used to unlock the Olthoi Door.<br>
<br>
After clearing the ramp behind the Olthoi Door, you can head either north or 
south at the intersection to reach a pit. Jump down and head through the 
passageway. Eventually, you will encounter a second pit.<br>
<br>
After hopping into the second pit, you'll eventually encounter an intersection 
heading to the northeast and northwest. Take either direction to find more bugs, 
including a pair of Olthoi Keepers and a Young Olthoi Queen. Defeating the Queen 
opens a door.<br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">The Young Olthoi Queen screams and falls. A acrid smell 
fills the room and the door on the far wall squelches open.<br>
The thunder of crushing Young Olthoi Queen is followed by the deafening silence 
of death!</font><font color="#00FF00"><br>
</font><br>
Before moving on, make sure to loot an Olthoi Chitin from her corpse (28 day 
timer). She carries 15 sets of Chitin on her enough for an entire fellowship.<br>
<br>
Head through the door, down a ramp and kill a few grubs in the final room. At 
first glance, an acid pool dominates the room. Upon further investigation, the 
pool is actually a Pool of Goo. Use the pool.<br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">You fill a jar full of the disgusting jelly.<br>
You cannot take any more jelly at this time.<br>
</font><br>
Cast Portal Recall to visit Sergeant Maloth again for your rewards.<br>
<br>
<font color="#00FF99">You give Sergeant Maloth Olthoi Chitin.<br>
Sergeant Maloth mashes his fists in celebration.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Well done! With this as proof 
of my defeating the Olthoi below I will garner much respect in our army. You 
should be rewarded for your assistance.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#00FF99">Sergeant Maloth gives you Renegade Pendant.<br>
Sergeant Maloth gives you Renegade Mace.<br>
You've earned 417,909 experience.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;There, and since I'm feeling 
so magnanimous I will also grant you access to the garrison whenever I see you 
wearing your pendant. It's the only way I will recognize you.&quot;<br>
Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Olthoi have a way of coming right back unless you 
kill them all so you may want to return to insure they have been exterminated.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#00FF99">You allow Sergeant Maloth to examine your Royal Olthoi 
Jelly.<br>
Sergeant Maloth flinches back at the smell coming from the jar.</font><br>
<font color="#FFFF99">Sergeant Maloth tells you, &quot;Disgusting! Keep your evil 
ichors to yourself!&quot;</font><br>
<br>
Notes from Andon of MT: </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The dungeon 
starts off looking like the Lugian Citadel. Lots of Lugians and Tumeroks in 
little alcoves. Once you reach the Reinforced Door, you begin to see Olthoi (and 
casualties on both sides). Past that point, the dungeon becomes a sandstone 
walled passage filled with weaker Olthoi (drones, soldiers, few nobles). At the 
end of this portion, you kill the Royal Olthoi Guardian and grab its Smelly 
Olthoi Gland to open a green &quot;olthoi door&quot; - use it just like a key. </font>
</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Past this point 
the scenery changes into the standard Olthoi decor, with Swarm Olthoi (Evicerators, 
Nobles, and Warriors) all over the place. Every couple of rooms would be filled 
with 20-30 Swarm olthoi. I didn't have much difficulty navigating the way since 
there weren't many dead ends beyond all the small side rooms. After killing a 
rather large swarm, I ended up in a vast purple room with a pit in the center. 
Jump down the pit and head down the only passageway. Later you'll end up in 
another pit room - again, jump down and continue. The room with the Young Queen 
was a V shape, effectively trapping up the olthoi while I replenished myself. 
She had two Olthoi Keepers and a handful of other protectors. I ended up finding 
a Sturdy Steel Key on one of the Keepers. </font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Grab the Olthoi 
Chitin off the body of the Young Queen (There were more than a dozen of them). 
At this point you'll see the message that the door she was guarding has opened. 
Through the door are several grubs guarding a dead olthoi body, which shows up 
as &quot;Pool of Goo&quot;. Double click it to receive Royal Olthoi Jelly. You can then 
Portal Recall to return to the beginning of the dungeon and give Maloth the 
chitin for the XP (5% of your level cost), Mace, and Pendant. With the Pendant 
worn, you will not have to pay an M note to enter the dungeon any further. <br>
<br>
Note: Since Nuhmudira is already gone, I didn't have a use for the Jelly. Sadly, 
I didn't not think to take a picture of the chitin or try to pick up more than 
one. <br>
<br>
Hope it helps, <br>
- Andon of MT</font></span></p>
