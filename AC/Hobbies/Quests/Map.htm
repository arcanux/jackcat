    of an Artifact</b><br>
    A friend of mine came across a man in a small cottage northwest of the West 
    Lytelthorpe Outpost. He said his name is Slithe Tradittor and claims to be 
    an Explorer for the Explorer Society. He expounded upon a tale of 
    discovering and unusual locale which harbors a strange device. This device 
    is apparently an artifact of Empyrean technology. This Explorer hungers to 
    obtain this device and study it.</font></span></i><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;Traveler. I have a tale 
    to tell and a task I would put upon you. Were you to take this task on 
    yourself, you will bear witness to things I have seen and a wondrous device 
    I glimpsed but could not fathom or grasp.&quot;<br>
    Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;For you see, there is an artifact in a place 
    unlike any that exists in Dereth.&quot;<br>
    Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;I am an explorer for the Explorer Society. In a 
    desert region, I came upon a suspended walkway hung out from the edge of a 
    cliff. The other end of the walkway was attached not to solid ground but was 
    lost in the spinning light of a portal. I held my breath and stepped upon 
    the walkway, half expecting it to collapse and throw me to the ground so far 
    below. Yet, the walkway held my weight! I crept forward and stepped through 
    the portal. I arrived on another walkway, or perhaps the same one somehow 
    extended through the portal. There was a platform at its far end, then 
    another walkway... Well, it is something you must see for yourself. Suffice 
    it to say that I journeyed through this structure, all the while being 
    assailed by vile creatures. Near the top of this construction I spied an 
    artifact- a tall pedestal it was, with arcane shapes gyrating in the air 
    above it. I know not its function but it was clear to me that this artifact, 
    this device, is of some import. There are many things it could be and none, 
    I believe, of small consequence! Before I was able to reach it, a wretched 
    monster sent me back to my Lifestone! Later, I attempted to return, yet the 
    portal would not permit me to pass. I know not why.&quot;<br>
    Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;I must study this device. I call it the &quot;Arcane 
    Pedestal.&quot; I even believe I have the means to create a version of it, but 
    first I require an imprint of its morphology.&quot;<br>
    Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;I shall give you a copy of my notes and an 
    Imaging Crystal. The notes show you the way to that place. The Imaging 
    Crystal can be imprinted with the composition and design of this device. 
    Return to me with the imprint embedded within the Crystal and I will study 
    it and determine how to create it.&quot;<br>
    Slithe Tradittor tells you, &quot;The Arcane Pedestal! We shall have the Arcane 
    Pedestal!&quot;</font><br>

    It was in the desert that I saw it. Due North of the Midsong Festival Stone. 
    Due south of the Recovered Temple Dungeon. Southwest of Al-Jalima. I had 
    climbed a steep escarpment and walked along the edge of the cliff. I saw the 
    glow of a portal and as I drew near I saw the hanging bridge suspended out 
    into nothingness. I do not know where in Dereth the portal placed me. Go 
    ever upward! The artifact is at the highest point. Remember to use the 
    Imaging Crystal on the artifact. </font></i></p>

    2.3N, 0.9W. You must be flagged by talking to Slithe before you may enter. 
    Head through the portal and soon you will be fighting miles above the land! 
    You'll encounter some new Undead: 
    <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20845.html">Warriors of the Blood</a> (level 60), 
    <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20694.html">Champions of the Blood</a> (level 
    79 Skeletons) and <a href="../../pet.asp-ctrID=20849.html">Warlocks of the Blood</a> (level 
    70). 
    The Champions are the toughest foes, with their excellent shields! If you 
    have two people fighting, with one attacking from behind, you'll more easily 
    defeat them. Warlocks cast level V debuffs and Drain Health.</span></font></p>

    after spending quite a bit of time in the Floating City. I must say I do 
    enjoy it here. From a good height, one can study the lay of the land and for 
    one of my avocation that is quite a happy thing! In my spare time I have
