the silk that I used to make a shirt for Jaleh al-Thani. Oh I remember it very 
well. He asked for a shirt made in a very ornate and overly pretentious way.&quot;<br>
Ro Bi-Jor, Apprentice Tailor tells you, &quot;This was the first item that my master 
had me craft. When Jaleh came to collect it he pointed out a tiny flaw in my 
weaving and demanded the cost be lowered. It was, but so was my pay. I was very 
angry with him. Very angry with him.&quot;<br>
Ro Bi-Jor, Apprentice Tailor tells you, &quot;I have heard that he is missing. Surely 
you don't think that I had anything to do with it. Please you must believe me.

<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you use the fir tree, the 
room you enter has four sections. If you die, take note of where the portal was 
when you entered. If it was directly in front of you, it needs to be directly in 
front of you again when you re-enter for you to have a chance to recover your 
body. Yse portal recall to head back to Lady Maila Estate then run to the Fir

again, and keep trying until the room configuration is the same as when you

</font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Rolling Balls of Death</font></b></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<font color="#66FF99">You've done well thus far--but now comes the test of cunning. There are two ways 
out of this next room: Death and out through the portal you can see across the 
length of this chamber. Good luck.<br>
</font>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Yes, it's the rolling balls of death room!! You'll see a 
series of raised platforms hovering above brightly colored rolling balls. Don't 
let the numerous corpses littering the floor stop you! If you steel your nerves 
and travel with care, you will successfully reach the Eagle's Sight portal on 
the opposite side of the room!</span></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<span lang="en-us">There are two ways to make it through safely. The first is by 
jumping across the platforms. The second is by running through the room.</span></font><p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">To jump, hug the wall to your 
left and hop up onto the first platform in the corner. This area is safe, so you 
might want to practice your jumping first by counting the floor tiles to the 
first platform and adjusting your take off according to your skill. Stand on the 
edge of the platform and do a full shift jump straight ahead (hold down the 
shift key and forward arrow and fill your space bar fully before releasing). Do 
another full shift jump kitty corner to the next platform. Do another kitty 
corner full shift jump and another. You'll then do two smaller shift jump onto 
the last few platforms until you're directly facing the wall above the portal. 
Below you, red death balls slowing roll across your path. Watch the pattern for 
a few minutes to judge your timing, then do a full running jump against the 
wall. As you slide down the wall, keep running forward and you'll go through the 
portal. Phew!!</font></span><p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
Azag-Thoth of SC describes the alternative method:</font></span><p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Start off in a little alcove 
with a platform just ahead. Watching for a sec will show that the area between 
the platform and the wall, for the width of the room, is safe. Simply WALK into 
the room, stopping before this first platform and turn right to face the 
platform in the corner. Then move to that platform and turn left. DO NOT proceed 
yet, watch for a second. When the ball here spawns you have approximately 5-6 
seconds to get under the platform directly ahead, so once it spawns and is clear 
move out. <br>
<br>
Now, we are under a platform with balls coming at us from all sides, nice eh? 
Turn to face the exit portal (about 45 degrees left if you followed these 
directions to the letter) and again wait a few seconds. As you wait, watch the 
balls. A pattern quickly becomes evident and timing your sprint becomes easier. 
When the path is clear you have about 3 seconds to get to the portal, go for it, 
don't stop, watch what's coming your way and dive into the portal.&quot;</font></span><p>
<span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Target<br>
</b>When you enter the next room, invisible enemies attack you with arrows from 
about 8 points in the room. You may wish to buff before the death ball room so 
you're prepared when you first enter. You'll see a small target on platform 
across from a big pit full of molten lava! In order to complete this section, 
you must hit the target with a critical hit to be portalled to the next test. If 
you have a high jump skill (reports of success with 310 base), you may also be 
able to jump across the platform to the other side.<br>
<br>
To crit the target, you can use a bow or a crossbow, a thrown weapon, or life or 
war spells, such as Martyr's Hetacomb. You don't need to be trained or 
specialized in these skill to attack the target.</font></span><p><font face="Arial" size="2">

You made it through three of four, but now lies the most difficult. There is 
only one right answer here. There are four little tuskies here; the fifth, much 
larger one is their baby-sitter. You'll need to talk to the babysitter and 
decipher his riddle or be sent away from this place for a time; shall we say a 
week? There can be no mistakes now... think really hard on this one.<br>

likes to play with a ball, but they will only play with a ball of their favorite 
color. Speak to them to learn whose favorite color is which. But be warned:&quot;<br>

Babysitter tells you, &quot;One is a liar, One always tells the truth, one alternates 
between the truth and fiction and the last, whose rules for telling the truth 
when he makes three statements are different than the other three tuskies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Babysitter tells you, &quot;One final note: The tuskies like the color of the balls 
dependent on their age. The youngest likes the green ball. The oldest likes the 
blue ball. The second oldest likes the red ball. The second youngest likes the 
yellow ball.&quot;</font><br>
