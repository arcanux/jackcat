	<p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">This fighting potato was 
	brought to you courtesy of Shanton, my irl buddy, who introduced me to 
	Asheron's Call.<br>
	<br>
	In May of 2001, on the 4th rendition of my character, a 57/44/32/37/75/85 
	4-school disaster, Spud battle landed in Dereth.<br>
	<br>
	I immediately swore to Shanton's patron, Enock, and happily remained his 
	vassal for over 2 years. At the time, our monarch was Clockwork II.<br>
	<br>
	About level 20-something or so, Enock summoned a portal to a mysterious dark 
	cave, and Shanton and I watched in fascination as an obviously powerful 
	mage, Bliss Ever, cast spell after spell in a dazzling array of sparks, 
	streaks, circles, and flares. Magnificent!<br>
	<br>
	Bliss and Enock spent a lot of time hunting and dieing together, and it was 
	no surprise when I logged in to be a part of the Hellhawk monarchy one day. 
	Bliss had pledged to a rather humble man by the name of Shogun, and he 
	willingly took on Enock.<br>
	<br>
	I spent many many levels there, enjoying the view from the patio, taking 
	part in large meetings, and getting acquainted with the societal structure 
	Turbine had built into this &quot;game&quot;. This remains my one and only mmorpg and 
	it was within Hellhawk and his supporting mediums I realized what a journey 
	I had gotten myself into.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, Hellhawk and Shogun didn't see eye to eye on a few things, 
	and 'hawk booted my future monarch after he apparently hit a nerve.<br>
	<br>
	Not long after, I was filled with excitement one night as I ran with Shogun, 
	Bliss, Shanton, and a few others on a strangely symmetric path as it wound 
	to and fro, rising into the night sky. Finally the group stopped in front of 
	a giant mansion. &quot;It will be here that I grow old,&quot; declared my new monarch.<br>
	<br>
	And it was and he did.<br>
	<br>
	Shogun was a good man, a role model monarch for me. He purchased the mansion 
	and dedicated it to Bliss. He let us play in it. At a meeting one day he 
	basically said he wasn't going to continue to fulfill the role of monarch.<br>
	<br>
	I continued to grow and remained faithful for a very long time, refusing an 
	offer to be a direct because Enock was such a cool patron. I spent the 
	majority of my AC life at Shogun's mansion, and met most of my AC friends 
	thru his allegiance.<br>
	<br>
	Shogun accepted new vassals, and Granthor somehow found her way to us. Some 
	time after Shogun's declaration, Granthor asked to pledge to me. What an 
	honor! Troll the Destroyer was as solid a friend as I could ask for. 
	Wickedkitty became a good friend. I had met Redrunner by now and she brought 
	many friends. An old school friend Tanith appeared for a few months and 
	asked to pledge. Honored! There were people joining and recreating from a 
	different server. Finally the balance between player and monarch shifted and 
	I found myself at a turning point in my AC career.<br>
	<br>
	The chat log of the meeting where I broke is posted on my web site somewhere 
	(old news links). It was a joyous occasion and there was much celebrating. 
	Yay.<br>
	<br>
	I had taken over Shanton's villa at the time as he was taking one of those 
	things they call a &quot;timeout&quot;? I dunno, still don't get that term. So we 
	recalled to Dryreach Beach Manors for a short time and our group was able to 
	work up the necessary payment items to buy a mansion. We found one, albeit 
	out in the sandy desert, and we called it home for five months.<br>
	<br>
	Which brings me to where we were last week (June 2004): Shogun has moved on, 
	and I purchased his mansion. I now am very proud to call my old monarch's 
	mansion mine. It was one of my biggest in game goals, to get back to that 
	beautiful view.<br>
	<br>
	Adventurers Anonymous look over the big pond from 83.2s, 3.9e, a short jaunt 
	north from the Land Bridge Villas settlement portal found in Q'alabar. I 
	change my allegiance bindstone on a whim, there is no 'home town' (we are 
	adventurers).<br>
	<br>
	We've never had any organized xp based chains. We don't openly recruit and 
	spam advertisements. We do care about each other and like to have fun, and 
	emphasis is placed on in-game interaction. I've my share of beta guys runnin' 
	about and also a few mature 9 year olds. I don't need to dictate a CoC 
	because the folks in AA know how to use common sense and respect their 
	neighbors. We'll always try to do what's right, and are quick with a helping 
	hand.<br>
	<br>
	The web site (http://www.aa4ac.org) is fairly plain, because I care more 
	about actual in-game time than web development. If anyone would like to 
	interact with the group, the Forums on our site are the best resource.<br>
	<br>
	I must apologize to the reader at this point for my lengthy reply. However, 
	it is with due cause. I didn't want to gloss over anything as I consider Ms. 
	Jackcat's representation of our community one of the finest, if not the 
	hands-down best. Thank you Maggie. You are a shining example of the stars 
	that can be found in our world.</font></span></p>
