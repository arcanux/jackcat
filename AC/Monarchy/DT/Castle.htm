    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are an Anti guild that 
	formed in the fall of 2004 after spending a year in both TFK and Gold Toof. 
	We call ourselves the Castle Dwellers because of the 5 years we have been 
	lifestoned at Neydissa Castle, where the name came up as a joke. It seemed 
	almost appropriate to have the nickname become our guild name <br>
	<br>
	--Membership Requirements: you must be an Anti who values his guild and is 
	not just looking for someone to power level him or her. We always look for 
	good people who want to help us fight the good fight, make some friends, and 
	have some fun.<br>
	--Experience Chains: since the exp chain ended as far as passup we have a 
	board on our website so that if anyone is interested, they can be assigned a 
	patron and a vassl.<br>
	--Game Focus: Quests, Hunting, PK. We have members who are exceptionally 
	talented in leading quests. We also love to group fellow, so we can get our 
	lower levels up in levels. And in Darktide, who doesn't love to raid or 
	defend? <br>
	<br>
	As Ricky is our monarch, I should say he has been wonderful with us. He 
	laughs at the jokes made about his name and admires anyone willing to wear 
	his tag to fight PKs. He has a big heart and has always helped out anyone 
	who needed him. He is the kind of monarch who will fight with his followers, 
	even if it means dying with them. His two main allies are the guild Alzar, 
	which is also a break from his old guild Gold Toof and also Powers Inc, who 
	remain to this day, one of the oldest and proudest old school antis in the 
	game... <br>
	<br>
	I chose to become a Castle Dweller because I share the same feelings about 
	the game as Ricky. I liked that Ricky wanted to have a guild where everyone 
	mattered, even the level 5. One of the comments he made about a raid was 
	what gained his respect to me. A level 20 mage wanted to raid and said that 
	she would not be able to do much. Ricky told her, &quot;Just by going you show 
	how much u can do.&quot; He was right... that mage stood back and healed as we 
	fought PKs, dying last in a raid where we all died.<br>
