    About the Shadows of Dereth<br>
    <br>
    </b>The Shadows of Dereth allegiance on the Frostfell server is based on a 
    few simple principles: friendship, loyalty, devotion, teamwork, fairness, 
    fun and honor. With a zero tolerance for combat macroing, experience chains, 
    thieves and griefers, the monarchy was established by a small group of 
    friends determined to keep the old school allegiance feeling alive. Members 
    are encouraged to attend the monthly meetings to meet people and so they 
    know that their voice is important to the group.</span></font></p>
    <p>
    <b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Allegiance Roles</font></span></b></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Monarch:</b><span lang="en-us"> The Monarch 
    guides the discussions during clan meetings. Issues are tweaked until the 
    group comes to a consensus. The Monarch has no more power than any other 
    allegiance member. His role is to help keep order and to help keep the 
    allegiance running. </span><br>
    <br>
    <b>High Council Members:</b><span lang="en-us"> The High Council Members
    </span>help <span lang="en-us">run allegiance events and help with any 
    problems that crop up. Like the Monarch, High Council Members have no more 
    power than any other allegiance member, but they do get special recognition 
    and thanks, plus pretty colors on the allegiance boards. :) Council Members 
    are chosen by their desire to help make the allegiance a better place for 
    everyone, or for good deeds and selfless acts.</span><br>
    <br>
    <b>Clan Members:</b><span lang="en-us"> The Clan Members, the Council 
    Members and the M</span>onarch <span lang="en-us">are all equals. N</span>obody is considered better th<span lang="en-us">a</span>n anyone else no matter what :).</font></p>

        <p><span lang="en-us"><b>History of the Shadows of Dereth</b></span></p>
    </font>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">The story of the Shadows of 
    Dereth actually begins with the demise of
    <a href="../WhereNow/Archer.htm">Archer From Hell</a>'s 
    allegiance. Like so many young wedded couples, Savona and Archer weren't able to weather 
    the ups and downs of marriage. The union dissolved, and the monarchy soon 
    followed.&nbsp; Archer decided to create a new beginning in the form of Army 
    of Darkness and swore to another clan. Over time, Army of Darkness made new 
    friends and gained new followers. When Army of Darkness turned 50,  Archer From Hell 
    (now level 80) was retired.</span></font></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Army of Darkness became 
    deeply involved in this new group, attaining a position of importance.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"> 
    As his access to the inner circle increased, so too did his disagreements 
    with the clan. Unsatisfied with big monarchy drama, Army consulted with 
    close friends on what to do. The decision to leave coincided with the clan's 
    decision to release him; Army of Darkness and his former clan mutually 
    agreed to part ways.</span></font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Army of Darkness was now 
    faced with a difficult choice: did he search out a new group to join, or 
    should he go back to the role he played in previous days, as a Monarch.</span></font><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
    He discussed the choice with his followers, asking their advice. They agreed 
    to strike out on their own, as equals. True equals, where no matter what 
    level, rank, or number of followers, the only thing that matters is 
    attitude, honor and the ability to get along with others.</font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The group is young, but thing 
    are going well. They try to do quests every day, either a low level, 
    mid-high level, or non-restricted quest, and then hunt together and hang out 
    at the mansion chatting. Their goal is to minimize the drama, deal with 
    issues right away, and not keep secrets from each other. Many are friends in 
    real life, or have spoken on the phone. They include a real life photo 
    gallery on the clan web site.</font></span></p>

    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">I was hunting 
    in Ayan BSD one winter's day in Dereth, when I came across a player named 
    Army of Darkness. From that day, we have been the best of friends. After 
    much pain and torture in previous clans due to people leaving, quests being 
    in another time zone, people arguing, Army and his small group of followers 
    decided to take Dereth on, as the clan &quot;The Shadows of Dereth.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    It's been going for a short while, I'm guessing 6 months or so. In those 6 
    months, I've never in my life seen so much determination from a group to 
    make an allegiance work. <br>
    <br>
    We run quests for the clan on a daily basis, whether it be for those of the 
    family who aren't above a certain level or those where we all join in. The 
    majority of the clan is European, although we do have a lot of Americans 
    also. </font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="arial" size="2">I like Shadows of Dereth because it's a small, 
    friendly group of people. The quests that take place are mostly in the GMT 
    time zone, so that suits all the Europeans perfectly. We always have a lot 
    of fun, whether it be talking at the family mansion or doing quests 
    together. Its the best clan I've ever been in. I think the main reason for 
    that is the people; we are all a fantastic group of people.</font></span><p align="left">

    Call is played by thousands of people, and there are different reasons for 
    each one of these people to play and enjoy the game. <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    think it's just so great to see so many positive, energetic and intelligent 
    people all in one community (the clan). The fact that it is comprised of 
    such a great bunch of people means that doing a quest (which we do 
    regularly) is always fun<span lang="en-us">, </span>whatever the trophy at 
    the end of it<span lang="en-us"> may be, simply</span> because of the people

    <font face="Arial" size="2">This is definitely the best allegiance that I've 
    been in during my time in AC. What I like are the friendly people we have in 
    the clan who are always willing to help each other out, be it giving some 
    buffs to clear vitae, or helping to recover corpses, or quests being run. 
    Army of Darkness, the monarch, is a great guy, who even though he's no doubt 
    very busy, always has time for any of his followers no matter what the 
    reason. <br>
    <br>
    This is the first clan that I have found to really try and base some of its 
    events around the UK/Euro time zones (since we do have a sizeable number of 
    Non-US players of which I am one). This means I don't need to try and stay 
    up through the night till 6AM to complete a quest. Chaynal designs and 
    maintains the clan website which I believe is very good indeed, certainly 
    the best that I've seen for an AC clan. The sections on the site are 
    informative and the message forums are a great way of communicating with your 
    friends when not in-game <br>
    <br>
    I feel many things contribute towards making this clan a great, fun 
    experience for all, but overall, like most things in life, it's the people 
    that make it special for me. Thx everyone. </font></span><p align="left">
