    The Story Behind The Guardians of Light<br>
    </b></span>
        <br>
        <span lang="en-us">Guardian of Light was the patron of my patron. He 
    decided he should leave the &quot;Reeve Monk&quot; and break his allegiance to the man 
    he was sworn to (he was a direct vassal of the monarch). I requested that my 
    patron and other members under him meet with Guardian of Light. After some 
    discussion I was pleased with what he had to say, although I was very torn 
    between keeping my loyalty to &quot;Reeve Monk&quot; or keeping my loyalty to my 
    patron. I so much wanted to be loyal to my patron and felt that Guardian of 
    Light was an honest person with qualities that would make him a good Monarch 
    of his own guild. </span> </font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2">
        <span lang="en-us">He possessed the same ideas I had of what a guild 
    should be. At this time I still wasn't too sure I liked him, because he was 
    very quiet and only answered when he was asked a question. He did not offer 
    more or less information. But the answers he did give were to my liking. So 
    I struggled with my decision, but decided it was the right thing and stayed 
    with my patron as his patron became Monarch of his own guild. <br>
    <br>
    The guild is now named Guardians of Light. It started small at first, but we 
    have grown into family, all helping each other as it should be. I was made a 
    General in our guild. I have since done all I can to help Guardian of Light 
    and all the members with whatever I can. We have joined together to build 
    this monarchy as friends, and we treat each other as friends. We have grown 
    so much since the beginning, and did it all without hurting each other or 
    stepping on each other's toes.</span></font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">We are a non-griefing guild. A 
    lot of our guild's code of conduct was taken from the guidelines of other 
    guilds. Breaking the rules and our code of conduct can and will get you 
    removed from the allegiance and/or banned from rejoining under any other 
    members. We also have meetings and promotions for officers.<br>

        members, and try to stay up-to-date on new events. The members have many

        contents and gives out prizes to the members. <br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">When WE was coming on line we could not decide 
    who should be the monarch. So we had a contest. The one who was the highest 
    level in 30 days with no macroing or swearing to another monarch would be 
    the monarch. The contest began and at the end, Winter Hawk was the highest level of all 
    the peeps. Therefore, Winter Hawk was monarch. But GOL was not happy because 
    he really really wanted to be the man. So a discussion took place between us and we decided he would be a better monarch. 
    As time passes, we found GOL could use some 
    higher level friends, so he swore to Reeve with our approval. Later, GOL decided to leave, but 
    again asked for our 
    approval. We did approve and formed the Guardians of Light. Winter Hawk implemented 
    the Generals, Commanders and LT idea. GOL created the COC. And we went forward to 
    make the best Monarchy we now have today.<br>
    <br>
    I have had some nice ideas that have been taken and implemented and I like 
    the team we have. If we come across a problem, we don't get rid of the 
    person, but rather try to figure out what is going on and try to solve it first 
    before reacting. Hmm... I also like it because it was my idea to form this 
    monarchy and I even stepped down as Monarch as Winter Hawk and gave it to 
    GOL. That was a great decision. GOL has been a far greater Monarch then I 
    could have been, so it has also been a learning experience. Being 
    in the monarchy is like an extended family. As we all go through the changes 
    in size, the 
    ups and downs in membership, and the changes in the structure, it all adds to the reasons 
    I 
    like it.<br>

    only every once in a while. I just like the people in the allegiance. GoL makes 
    sure there are no bad seeds and I like that a lot. I wouldn't choose any 
    allegiance other than this one ever.<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">I came to this monarchy searching for a guild 
    that hunts and quests together. My previous monarchs were weak in this 
    area, but through luck and what not, I  met Miss Zolvera. She was in 
    Glenden Wood, and was about the same level as I was. We belonged to the same 
    monarchy at the time, so we spoke to each other and hunted together. And then one day, 
    we met the Great and 
    Glorious Guardian of Light, himself, who had broken away from his patron to 
    form his own monarchy. I was looking for a monarchy where one did not feel 
    like it was bothersome for a lower level to approach a higher level for aid, 
    and where all gave freely of themselves to aid another guild member, or 
    anyone in game that may need help.  </font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">I talked with Guardian of Light in Qalaba'r, and listened to his words. He recognized me for who I am and was, 
    just another gimp who was trying to make his way in a world that would bring 
    death quicker than one could say Subway. He accepted me into his guild, and it 
    has been a growing and thriving community even since. Some have gone their separate ways due to the style of play; others have joined knowing that they 
    are now part of a greater good. In the end, Guardian of Light may be the 
    leader, but he has made me feel as through my opinion matters, and that 
    equality is not based on level or skill, but on trust, and devotion to all who 
    call themselves the Guardians of Light.<br>
