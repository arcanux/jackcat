    I asked Elder about the structure and philosophy of his monarchy. His 
    answers were uncomplicated: no membership requirements, no experience 
    chains, have fun, help others, go questing!</font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Could it really be that

    of generals, the House of Elder has a group of volunteers who act as

    </font><b>Tales from the House of Elder<br>
    <br>
    </b></span></font><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">I am Nabata of the House of Elder, my patron is 
    Balash.<br>
    <br>
    This is a story about Kelci Gittamad. She was a beloved member whom we lost 
    in RL [real life] to complications from cancer. In her honor, Elder renamed 
    his Mansion, Kelci Mansion, for her. No mention of the House of Elder would 
    be complete or accurate without mention of Kelci :)<br>
    <br>
    As Nabata looked around, all she could see through tear-stained eyes, were 
    other members of the House sobbing. There is no potion or spell to ease this 
    pain, no sacrifice to make, no lifestone to look to find her. She is truly 
    gone. Gone to an enemy we cannot fight. Gone to a foe we cannot band 
    together to defeat. On Feb 20, House of Elder lost a dear friend. Kelci 
    Gittamad left us for the last time. We know it was not her choice to go, and 
    we know that beast called ARS will not return her. We weep for ourselves and 
    for Ali Goboom and Rajput, her husband and son. Yet, our memories of Kelci 
    are many and happy.<br>
    <br>
    Nabata met Kelci Gittamad when they were young and shared a patron. There 
    was an outing at the Lin Lugian Citadel. A few moments of hello and how are 
    you, then into the fray. Kelci was fast with her crossbow and sword, Nabata 
    tried to keep up. They would often speak long distance as they were doing 
    various things.<br>
    <br>
    There was the time Kelci killed her Alchemist, Madame Curie, the first time 
    she made health potions. Nabata remembers loosing health from falling over 
    and skinning her knee laughing so hard.<br>
    <br>
    There was all the dull and boring moments hunting in the Fenmalain dungeon. 
    Both warriors wanted GSA. That meant shards and shadow poop as Kelci liked 
    to call it. Kelci waited to get hers, so Nabata could finish gathering her 
    bits. They ran together to Al-Jalima to get their armour. William the Bat 
    has a picture of the two of them in their new armour - Nerf Queens with 
    Sticks!<br>
    <br>
    Kelci was my sister in arms, I think of her everyday.</font></span><p align="center">

    One day, I hunt on Aerlinthe, and recall at 175% burden (when I need to 
    recall and I am on Aerlinthe, I usually pick everything on the ground until 
    my backpack is full). I was LS in Mayoi. I decide to run to Lin and being 
    lazy, I decided to take a shortcut, the road is too boring for me, so I pass 
    by the mountains. All was well, and I really enjoy the beautiful nature I 
    saw. When suddenly, I pass near a Linvak Ursuin<span lang="en-us">.</span>
    <span lang="en-us">I</span>t must have been a female 
    and I pass too close to her childs, because the Ursuin chase me for 2 
    minutes. When it first hit me for 135 of damage, ouchy!!!!! I try to evade 
    it, but too late, another hit, I was back at the LS??<br>
    <br>
    I decided to sell before trying to find my body. It was the January 1st, and 
    after 2 hours of research, no success. I had to log, New Year dinner. I 
    though that body was lost forever. When I log back the day after, Rokru give 
    me a bracelet and ask me to read the inscription. I just do it, and I read 
    &quot;That Linvak Ursuin really want you.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I laugh, then Rok log a mule and give me all the stuff I have lost. He tell 
    me that he, Twyllah, and someone else have take turn to guard my corpse to 
    recover the stuff on it. That is why I love the House of Elder, friendship 
    and taking care of each other. They all promise they will never told that

    to Save Elder</b><br>
    <br>
    In my low 20s, I was still fighting those big giants with big rock that 
    really hurt, because I was never trained to dodge a missile weapon -- too 
    dishonorable as a weapon in my mind -- at The Forking Trails near the Gharu 
    town of Qalaba'r. Well, I was tired of killing them and that their females 
    was always hiding and gave birth to more Lugian. I could never believe the 
    rate they growth, they are adult in a matter of milliseconds. So, I decided 
    to move away and rampage to find a new hunting ground. I move along the 
    road, until I see a portal. I get excited, and enter the portal after I have 
    equipped my magical items. Before long, I saw that Zephyrs was there. I 
    remember them from the Tou-tou Sewer that I have enter once at level 5 (No 
    level requirement at that time) and they have killed me in no time in the 
    Tou-tou Sewer.<br>
    <br>
    I was angry at them, and blood pressure start to raise at maximum speed, I 
    slash with all my strength with rage to kill them. At first, I do well, very 
    well. Until a RED Zephyr (Most be red because it's a real Player KILLER) 
    launch a Whirlwind Blade V on me?..<br>
    <br>
    With my determination, I run there once again, get killed. 2 more try, then 
    I remember some strange guy named Elder that have claim he will assist in 
    recovery. So, I try to give him a tell. HE WAS ON, and even more wonderful, 
    he was replying. After a few tells, he finally show up at the Mountain 
    Fortress with The Death Angel. At that time, I though that the recall spell 
    where able to make you recall to any town in Dereth, so I never know I was 
    really asking for a major move. I was in shock when I ID him, he was level 
    57?? Dang, I never ever saw someone that was more then level 33, so hehe.<br>
    <br>
    After a quick buff, Elder tell TDA [The Death Angel] to make sure I live out 
    there, and he ask me to stay behind. I guess that knowing me now, he will 
    never try to ask me to back off. I was full of anger, and want to kill them. 
    But Elder say to back off again, so I obey??.<br>
    <br>
    After 5 minutes, all my 4 corpses are recover. Elder ask me if I want to go 
    to the grand father, I say NOOOO WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY. I didn't even know who was 
    the grand-father? Hehe, After thanking him, he recall and I logged. My 
    roommate was aware of the recovery, and when I saw the level of Elder, I ask 
    him to come and see the highest level on Dereth I ever saw (I had the 
    passion to ID everyone at that time to know their level). After Elder 
    recall, my roommate saw him near the LS in Tou-tou, and he thank Elder for 
    the rescue. What was the answer of Elder????<br>
    <br>
    He just gave a full load of Wand/staff/orb, and move away with a big smile.<br>

    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Story of Asha'man</b><br>
    <br>
    I was a boy, like any other. I worked with my father in the shop, cutting 
    oak planks for the wine barrels he'd make. Being a cooper's son had its 
    advantages, of course. We always had meat on the table and I had the 
    opportunity to meet many of the nobles when they summoned my father to bring 
    them some nicely toasted barrels for their vintages.<br>
    <br>
    It was during these trips that I learned that nobility has more to do with 
    the way a man conducts himself than with who his parents are.<br>
    <br>
    The Lord of our region was a spoiled, callous young man who'd never had to 
    work in his life. His estates were enormous and had under the umbrella of 
    peace for as long as anyone could remember. Lord Yale had every luxury 
    imaginable and entertained himself with the distractions that only the well 
    bred can afford. He was known far and wide for the exceptional falcons his 
    aviary produced. He was also known for his unemotional cruelty.<br>
    <br>
    I had just seen my 15th winter when my father received a missive from Lord 
    Yale demanding twelve new casks, to be delivered before the mid spring 
    celebration. If we worked feverishly, we would just have the time to 
    complete the task. Father and I purchased the iron straps and the fine oak 
    timbers. We split the wood and formed the barrels. <br>
    <br>
    While toasting the inside of the barrels, I discovered that if I 
    concentrated just right, I could seem to make the flames behave the way I 
    chose. Father and I laughed in delight at the mystery and together we 
    trained my abilities such that I could make the fires hot enough to quickly 
    ruin the barrel, or cool enough to give a long, slow toasting. After the 
    second week, I could even summon a bolt of fire and launch it at a distant 
    target, though I was only really successful in doing this when I had a 
    pocket full of onyx and some medicinal herbs.<br>
    <br>
    Because of my newly discovered talents, the product was finished ahead of 
    schedule and were, without doubt, the finest brandy casks we'd ever 
    produced. Ever the professional, my father sent a messenger to Lord Yale's 
    Spring Estate giving notice that we were delivering the barrels in the next 
    couple of days. My spirits soared as we drove the wagon down the Kings 
    highway. I couldn't wait to see the expression on the face of Lord Yale's 
    master brewer when he saw the barrels.<br>
    <br>
    We were surprised that Lord Yale, himself, met us as we pulled up in front 
    of the manor. He was dressed all in dark blue velvet and had a cup hilt 
    sword hanging from a gilded scabbard at his side. He appeared every bit the 
    gentleman.<br>
    <br>
    Lord Yale believed himself to be an excellent judge of the cooper 
    tradestuffs and examined the barrels very closely. My father loved a good 
    joke and so prompted the Lord to notice how smooth the boards were on the 
    outside of the barrel. Lord Yale nodded approvingly and commented at how the 
    fine sanding of the staves would help with the aging of the brandy. My 
    father could not contain his mirth at this absurd statement. It was almost a 
    whole minute before my father could compose himself to offer an apology for 
    his fun.<br>
    <br>
    Lord Yale was literally red with fury. He stormed over to the guard house 
    and dragged the Captain of the Guard into the courtyard by his ear. <br>
    <br>
    &quot;Seize them all!&quot;, he bellowed. &quot;Take him too.&quot;, he said, pointing at the 
    poor man helping us to unload the wagon. &quot;Throw them in the dungeons and I 
    expect you to swallow the key.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In spite of the stories I'd heard about our Liege Lord, I never expected him 
    to react so poorly to a good natured joke. I stood there in shock as the 
    Captain called for his men.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Run, Ash!&quot;, my Father yelled. &quot;Don't worry about me.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I ran as fast as I could. As I reached the woods near the manor, I saw a 
    stream. I'd heard enough stories from the Ranger in the pup to know that I 
    should run up stream, in case dogs were brought to track me.<br>
    <br>
    Hours passed, and I knew that I had escaped. The shame of my cowardice 
    burned inside me. I wanted to return to the house and valiantly fight to 
    free my father. I knew that I would die quickly if I tried any as stupid as 
    that, but I grieved horribly. My flight had probably cost my father his 
    life.<br>
    <br>
    I stood in the stream, tears in my eyes and cursed the sun for rising that 
    day. I wanted to swear revenge, but my Father had taught me that a life of 
    revenge was empty and bitter. I swore, instead, to do more good than Lord 
    Yale could do evil. I would make my mark in the world as an honorable and 
    loyal vassal to a Lord who proved his worthiness by his actions and 
    compassion.<br>
    <br>
    It was then that a purplish portal opened before me. I knew, somehow, that 
    this was the gateway to my future. I stepped through and found myself in a 
    wood. On the far side was a beautiful maiden archmage, sneaking up to a 
    floating creature, intent on the kill. I tried to throw my fire bolts at the 
    creature, to aid the mystical woman, but fizzled miserably. I heard the 
    monster whisper &quot;Onrui Chon-Ter&quot; as it pointed at the girl. She fell, 
    clutching at her abdomen. In moments, she'd become a beast of burden, a poor 
    dumb mule. I took the crest of her Lord, the mighty Zulu Dawn of the Eternal 
    Circle, and set out to find my fortune and a worthy Master, with Sindy at my 
    side.<br>
