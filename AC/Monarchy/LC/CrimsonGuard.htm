    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">My Ingame name is Greko and I 
	am the monarch of the Crimson Guard. The Crimson Guard was conceived and 
	birthed by Bishop Coop a couple years ago, and its primary focus at 
	inception was PK. The monarchy was very small, but as it grew, select people 
	were added, and a good majority of the Firebird people followed. As the 
	allegiance grew, it took on a personality of its own, and pk became a 
	smaller percentage of the followers, and replaced with a rich, diverse, 
	mature set of toons and people. When Bishop Coop left, our biggest concern 
	was carrying the torch he created forward in the manner and class with which 
	he led us. Today, we enjoy the company of about 1900 followers with about 
	30-35 being active members. This monarchy has always insisted on respect 
	from its followers, not only to our own people, but to the outside LC world 
	as a whole. <br>
	<br>
	We are governed by a council with two paths. Path 1 is the warring/pk headed 
	up by a pk commander, and Path 2 is a domestic/human affairs path that takes 
	care of the allegiance needs headed up by a Operations Commander. This 
	structure is located at:</font></span></p>

	<br>
	Our intention is to have fun. We have a published CoC, and conflict 
	resolution process. We ask that anyone wanting to add a vassal to make sure 
	they fit our standard of fun and respect before they do so. We also have 
	what we are very excited about, and that is The Rescue Rangers. The Rescue 
	Rangers give credit to individual people for making rescue runs for people 
	in our clan. As people make more rescue runs, they attain a new title on our 
	website, culminating at 100 runs being titled Rescue Ranger. This system 
	works, and ensures no one is left behind!<br>
