    <font face="Arial" size="2">The <b><i>Shadows of Dereth</i></b> is a hardy 
    group of adventurers based out of Holtburg on the Leafcull server. We search 
    the lands of Dereth for monsters to slay, quests to complete, and comrades 
    in need. We hold true the values of honour, loyalty and integrity. Our 
    members can pride themselves in their ability to gain a smile and a friendly 
    hello from any of Dereth's adventurers. This comes from our uncanny desire 
    to help those in need, this is not to say we are charitable (as we do not 
    believe in handouts), but we are willing to come to the aid of fellow 
    players.</font></p>

    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us">Our History</span>&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shadows of Dereth began
    <span lang="en-us">in </span>November 2001 in the town of Holtburg.&nbsp; I was 
    level 15 at the time, and had noticed that many of the Monarchies based out 
    of Holtburg seemed to be more interested in numbers than quality.&nbsp; I believe 
    that this still holds true for many of the current Monarchies to this day.&nbsp; 
    I noticed many new players in town that seemed to be overwhelmed by the 
    immensity that is AC.&nbsp; I wanted to be able to help them out, and to show 
    them the ropes.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At level 15 I had amassed a fair stash of 
    armour, weapons, and money (via trading in SUB and hunting).&nbsp; Along with 
    this wealth of goods I had compiled binders full of maps and information 
    regarding AC.&nbsp; I had not planned on trying to start a Monarchy, and 
    certainly not at such a low level.&nbsp; However, a player came up to me and 
    asked if I could show them around and perhaps explain a few things.&nbsp; I 
    certainly agreed and we set out to explore, with me giving hints and tips 
    along the way.&nbsp; Before we knew it 4 or 5 hours had passed and he was getting 
    along quite well.&nbsp; He asked if he could become my Vassal (I barely knew what 
    that was all about), but agreed to try it out.&nbsp; We formed an instant bond, 
    and would adventure together quite often.&nbsp; Between the two of us we spent a 
    fair amount of time socializing in and around Holtburg and got to know many 
    of the “regulars.”&nbsp; It was not long before more people began asking for 
    help, tips, and advice … And a Monarchy to join.&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It was then that I decided to give it a go 
    and attempt to create a Monarchy of my own.&nbsp; We grew amazingly fast in the 
    first few weeks, gaining member after member.&nbsp; Not wanting to become a 
    “faceless” Monarch with a bunch of “numbers” under me, I asked to meet all 
    new comers and would conduct a small interview with prospective members.&nbsp; 
    All new followers would then be subject to a trial period, for us and them 
    alike.&nbsp; And so we began …</font></p>

  		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our Goal System &amp; 
        Rankings</font></span></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shadows of Dereth was formed in an 
    attempt to bring together adventurers from all corners of Dereth: Men and 
    woman of all skills, levels, and styles of play. We come together to take on 
    challenging quests, to slay fierce beasts and to share some laughs. 
    Asheron's Call has done a fair job at providing goals through quests, but 
    all to often the end result is not fitting for the level of character 
    required to complete them. For this reason, our Monarchy has designed and 
    implemented it's own goals to reach. Currently these goals are mainly level 
    based (Up until level 30). More goals will be implemented that will 
    challenge the skills of players, rather than their level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The current goal system is as follows:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">Level 10 - D Note<br>
    Level 15 - M Note<br>
    Level 20 - M Note, Armour, and a Title within the Monarchy<br>
    Level 25 - M Note, Weapon/Wand/Orb, and a Promotion<br>
    Level 30 - Storage Space (in Mansion when we get one </font><font size="2">
    <span style="font-family: Arial">J</span></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> 
    ) and a Promotion<br>
    ** These rewards are only available to those players that reached their 
    goals unaided by the Monarchy Trainers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These rewards are to be paid by the Patron to 
    their Vassal upon them reaching the above goals. Should you as a Patron be 
    concerned about your ability to provide these rewards, you should speak to 
    your Patron or the Monarch directly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to keep the structure of the 
    Monarchy, and stretch it beyond the scope of Asheron's Call's limitations we 
    have implemented a ranking system, and as such, will assign Titles to those 
    worthy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The current ranking system, based upon 
    medieval British hierarchy, is as follows:</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>
    <a href="http://shadowsofdereth.dyndns.org/Monarchy/Monarch.htm" target="_blank" style="text-underline: single; text-decoration: none">
    Monarch</a></u><br>
    <a href="http://shadowsofdereth.dyndns.org/Monarchy/Alterego.htm" target="_blank" style="text-underline: single; text-decoration: none">
    Prince</a> / Princess<br>
    Grand Duke / Grand Duchess<br>
    Duke / Duchess<br>
    Marquis / Marchioness<br>
    Earl / Countess<br>
    Viscount / Viscountess<br>
    Baron / Baroness<br>
    Baronet</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">** The ranks above apply in relation to the 
    Monarch and have no bearing on a characters location within the Monarchy 
    Tree. This means that a Prince may in fact exist 3 or 4 tiers below the 
    Monarch. This method of ranking has been established in an effort to allow 
    players to be loyal to their Patrons, and thus have no need for constantly 
    rearranging the structure of the Monarchy Tree each time a person is 
    promoted.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the above mentioned Noble 
    Ranks lie other positions based upon a player's contribution to the 
    Monarchy.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Seigneur - Position of 
    authority over all players of a given tier. <br>
    Chancellor - Head of an institute of higher learning.<br>
    Viceroy - Special ambassadors of the Monarch.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Warriors:</i></b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Knights of the Garter - 
    Warriors knighted directly by the Monarch.<br>
    Knight Banneret - Warriors knighted for performance on the battlefield.<br>
    Knight Bachelor - Warriors knighted by their Patron for loyalty and valour.</font></p>
