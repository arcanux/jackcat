    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">DaMonarchy kicks off the new Monarchies of 
    Dereth section! Danier filled me in on a bit of the background of the 
    origins of DaMonarchy and how his earlier experiences as a vassal and 
    grand-vassal taught him valuable lessons about how he wanted to lead. How he 
    went from a level 34 to level 45 in less than a week (back in the days 
    before BSD!), killing the White Rabbit with ferocious intensity. How after 
    weeks of struggle and research, he cracked the spell formula on his own. 
    Then he adds, &quot;Of course, Splitpea came out roughly 2 weeks later, had a 
    rational user interface, and was instantly adopted by the public at large, 
    but that's a mere detail! &lt;g&gt;&quot; How he eventually broke to become a monarch, 
    and how over time, his little group has grown from a handful of players to 
    over 2000 people, not so much from active recruiting (with a few notable 
    exceptions, such as Doogen), but through the attractive atmosphere of 
    friendship and fun surrounding them.</font></span></span></p>
    <p>
    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Some of his insights follow:</font></span></span></p>
    <p>
    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I learned that the primary relationship in the 
    game was between patron and vassal, not follower and monarch.&quot;</font></span></span></p>
    <p>
    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Specifically, I became convinced that the ROLE 
    of a group was to BE a group. Yes, that might sound odd or strange, but I 
    came to the conclusion that the job of a group was to simply be a 
    community.&quot;</font></span></span></p>
    <p>
    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;But... back to the story... &lt;But this IS the 
    story Maggie... the relationships, the community, the feeling safe enough 
    within a group to HELP people.. this IS the story.&gt; &quot;</font></span></span></p>
    <p>
    <span class="287244617-02062002"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;We made some mistakes, by which I really mean 
    that I made some mistakes. Due to my distaste for the Aerlinthe Orgy of 
    Ugliness, I kept the group far away from that quest until perhaps 4-5 months 
    ago, when Doog replaced my hate-hate relationship with it with a love-hate. 
    damn him! &lt;g&gt; I have been slow a time or two to eject a person.. and slow a 
    time or two to actively recruit specific people who could add so much, but 
    in the end that is all a wash really.<br>
    <br>
    What we have done, and I want to be careful in how I express this sentiment, 
    is to assemble a group where people can be relaxed and be free to simply be 
    nice, to play the game, and to have someone with which to share themselves. 
    Not that the members of DaMonarchy wouldn't be nice without the group, but 
    that a large part of the intent I have with the group is to establish a 
    culture and social setting where acting nice isn't something one does to get 
    ahead, or to obtain something, and where being nice isn't rewarded with a 
    bat to the face, or by use or abuse. The goal in many ways is simply to be 
    able to have a place to play and a support group where people can have fun, 
    can be as open and friendly as they care to be, and can be safe from being 
    used in doing so.<br>
    <br>
    Most of this is a mood / culture thing, and such things are very delicate 
    and fragile. What makes it work isn't me spending vast amounts of time being 
    accessible, or being willing to break off hunting to answer questions, or 
    sacrificing my firstborn to Asheron or anything dramatic like that. Yes, I 
    do spend a lot of time in /tells, and I do spend a very great deal of time 
    leading, planning, running, organizing, scouting, and generally thinking 
    about quests which are run for the benefit of other people rather than 
    myself. I genuinely enjoy helping out by doing that sort of thing, and can 
    have a great deal of fun running across the Dires to get some funky portal 
    tie for a quest.<br>
    <br>
    But what makes it work is that there is a large group out there who want 
    this thing, this Monarchy, and who are willing to pay for it with their 
    time, energy, emotion, and caring. While we sometimes have fights, 
    misunderstandings, and disagreements, we all find there to be something 
    special in what we have built, something worth trying to keep. How does it 
    start? How DID it start? I have related the events above, but they really 
    aren't of particular relevance when it comes right down to it.<br>
    <br>
    It starts when one person heals another, tosses an armour spell, and says 
    have a nice day, and when the person being healed decides that he would like 
    to be in a group where people can just do that. Not for each other, just in 
    general. That really is the long and the short of DaMonarchy, the group of 
    which I am pleased and proud to be at the head.&quot;<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of these features being all about the

    spirit to me (an honorary hanger-on-er). And I asked the group a simple 
    question: Why do you like DaMonarchy? Their answers are below.</font></span></span></p>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Hello all, Doog here, thinking thinktank-y 
    thoughts...<br>
    <br>
    I'm of the firm belief that some things must be done just for fun. To that 
    end, I think it's time we all &quot;gave a little lovin&quot; back to Sugardaddy, our 
    group's [in]famous uber-craft mule. <br>
    <br>
    For those of you who don<span lang="en-us">'</span>t know, Sugardaddy is one of Danier's not-so-small 
    mules who has one set of MASSIVE trade skills. Last I bothered to ask him, 
    he was 350 or more on cooking, alchy, and was approaching that on fletching. 
    (Apologies if I'm low by, say, 15% Dan... that wouldn't surprise me...) :)<br>
    <br>
    What say we round up Sugar, <span lang="en-us">r</span>un his sweetness through the Focusing 
    <span lang="en-us">S</span>tone 
    quest and see if we can't get his cook-ness his own handy, dandy focusing 
    stone. DOING SO WILL EFFECTIVELY RAISE HIS FOCUS 50 PTS, WHICH WILL GIVE HIM 
    ANOTHER 25 PTS ON A FEW OF HIS TRADE SKILLS)<br>
    <br>
    Dan you know what you need to do with Sugar's stats... other than not raise 
    his health, pump us his run, will ya? :) And uh, learn Impen VI? :)<br>
    <br>
    This MUST be a group effort. Yes, I really am suggesting we take a level 53 
    with *6* (yes, six) health through a dungeon.<br>
    <br>
    So, who's with me? Who wants to help get Sugar a focusing stone? We need a 
    few dedicated healers, a few fighters, and uh, someone who knows the quest 
    (I don't). Thursday evening, 9:30 EST sound like fun? (Dan, I mean, uh, 
    sugar... if you're in, post a calendar event that works for you?)<br>
    <br>
    Doog<br>
    <br>
    p.s. If all goes well, all adventurers might want to consider a gift of a 
    greater mana charge to Sugar, let's not just get him a focusing stone, lets 
    see if we can't get him one... FILLED with the 13000+ mana it will hold. All 
    gifts must include a cheesy inscription.</font><p align="center">

    <font face="arial" size="2">Maggie, what a great 
    idea. Here is a story about how Galfrida became a DaMonarchian.
    Gal had a friend (Ayn Rand) who kept telling her about this awesome clan she 
    belonged to. She kept inviting Gal to come over and meet all the folks. 
    Well, I kept putting it off until one day the Clan <span lang="en-us">Gal</span> was in started 
    breaking up. Well, Gal 
    went on her own to the <span lang="en-us">DaMonarchy clan</span> house and the first thing she heard what this 
    level 90ish mage-type guy in tangerine telling these people he was the best 
    kisser in Dereth. Don't you know that perked Gal's  ears. lol Next thing I 
    know this guy is the Monarch. welllllllll..<span lang="en-us">.</span> now I'm interested. Besides, 
    Gal's liked the look of tangerine (not orange) on this guy. </font></p>
    <p align="left">
    <font face="arial" size="2">Ayn introduced 
    Galfrida around to those who were there and told them she was looking to 
    join the Dan Clan. Everyone was polite, talked to me and offered me help if 
    needed but not one offered to be her new patron. Just to clarify something. 
    Gal at that point had not seen her patron for several months and was on her 
    own and not liking it. So back to the &quot;old clan&quot; she went and found a new 
    patron. That did not last long. they did not see eye to eye on what a patron 
    should be. and what a vassal should be. So after a several weeks of trying 
    to stay there, Gal once again w<span lang="en-us">ent</span> looking for a home for her and her 40+ 
    vassals. They needed a good home.<br>
    <br>
    Gal's next visit to the Danier clan house found Ayn with Thunar and Valen 
    Thornduval there. Ayn once again introduced me and told them again I was 
    looking for a patron. This time, thank God, Valen offered to take Galfrida 
    as a vassal. Well, that has been a long time ago. I've never been happier 
    than being in the Danier Clan, They are the Best of the Best. But because of 
    all the hassl<span lang="en-us">e</span> I had gone through previously<span lang="en-us">,</span> I was still apprehe<span lang="en-us">n</span>sive until 
    my second meeting with Dan. It was at a clan meeting. I have never met 
    anyone so impressive. I was truly impressed with the way he handled the 
    meeting with authority and humor. I honestly believe it was the humor that 
    won me over totally. And the Clan ability to take huge numbers of toons on a 
    quest and finish it. That simply is awesome. Dan, you are awesome.. truly.<br>
    <br>
    Now Gal is the self appointed president of the Dan Clan Fanclub. lol Ask 
    anyone who hears me talk to others about the clan. I can't say enough good 
    things about them. I've found a home thanks to Ayn persist<span lang="en-us">e</span>nt urgings and 
    Valen's willingness to take on a lost soul called Galfrida.<br>

    Galfrida, Sin li, Angel Kisses, Acutenurse, Bowgirl and Ayn Rand are the

    Dan himself must have the pat<span lang="en-us">i</span>ence of Job, leading quest after quest, and

    50 times a day. Then with the addition of Doogen, and Quietfire, there is no

    Some of you may know that about a month and a half ago<span lang="en-us">,</span>
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> attempted the 
    <span lang="en-us">S</span>ingular<span lang="en-us">it</span>y weapon quest. 
    <span lang="en-us">Upon </span>nearing the final dungeon where the weapon 
    becomes non drop/destroy on death<span lang="en-us">,</span>
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> ran into an unfortunate accident. A 
    chaos wisp shot me down with a couple fire spells and the weapon was 
    destroyed.<br>
    <br>
    Not only did Doogen get my corpse<span lang="en-us">,</span> but he agreed to help me again when my 
    timer expired. Well a few nights ago<span lang="en-us">,</span>
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> was able to get the weapon and head for the 
    upgrade. Doogen buffed me 
    like crazy and we made it safely. Once inside <span lang="en-us">I</span> was amazed to see that with 
    <span lang="en-us">D</span>oogen<span lang="en-us">'</span>s buffs and banes and him drawing most of the baddied away 
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> was hit 
    for very minimal damage. Armored tuskers averaged about 2-5 points of damage 
    on me and crit me from behind for around 25 points! I was quite amazed and 
    we were nearing the end of the dungeon when tons and tons of hollows and 
    tuskers showed up.<br>
    <br>
    Being the brave man he is, Doog took them all on which was unbelievable. I 
    didn't think anyone could last more than a second or two with all those BIG 
    baddies on them. Doog sent me to the end to turn in my sword and 
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> did. Unfortunatel<span lang="en-us">y</span><span lang="en-us">, 
    I</span> took a few seconds too much to get the sword and<span lang="en-us">,</span> well<span lang="en-us">,</span> the 
    masses and masses of baddies finally were too much for Doog.
    Within a short period of time he had cleared and was safe outside with me 
    with all his stuff. I was amazed at how fast he had cleared the inside! 
    <br>
    <br>
    I had done it, gotten my sing sword, and it was all thanks to Doogen. I just 
    wanted to let everyone know how great Doogen is and he is one of the 
    toughest guys in the monarchy<span lang="en-us"> </span>(of course there is always Dan). Thank you 
    Doogen for all your help. I owe you everything. In short, Doog is amazing.<br>
    <br>
    I owe the monarchy everything and am always willing to help anyone out. If 
    you ever need anything please please feel free to ask it of me. <br>

    all, <br>
    I 
    have played for about 2 years now and I have been fortunate enough to be a

    <span lang="en-us">I</span> know <span lang="en-us">I</span> can trust them

    quest hungry followers<span lang="en-us"> </span>-- <span lang="en-us">I</span> believe 
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> would go absolutely crazy if <span lang="en-us">

    really helped each other just roll through the levels. Calli is just great, 
    she is everywhere and is willing to help me with whatever <span lang="en-us">
    I</span> need. I remember 
    Zero getting his GSA stolen a while ago and everyone had replaced it by the 
    next day without telling him. It was a great surprise!  </font><p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2">I have a few great

    helping me out with various items and quest info. If <span lang="en-us">I</span> need help getting a 
    body (<span lang="en-us">I</span> rarely do anymore since <span lang="en-us">
    I</span>'m a pro at dying) I can easily have at 
    least 5 of DaMonarchy there to help me out<span lang="en-us">, just like</span>

    <span lang="en-us">W</span>ell it is simple, 
    good people. I left the game for about 6 or 8 months, and decided to return 
    when things in my life evened out. I started 2 accounts and tied them 
    together. I returned to my patron of old, the often mentioned, the popular, 
    the kind and generous Calli/Zonata. I was almost immediately loaded down 
    (298 burden) with enough armor, jewelry and weapons by Elizabeth the 
    conquer, Jo's, and Logan Ryu to suit up 6 of my toons. I was then aided by 
    Elizabeth and jo's<span lang="en-us"> and Xiodan</span> and some of their 
    friends in power leveling, and even given financial aid from them. I now have my sword and mage up to level 34 and 35, with other toons in their teens and twenties.

    <span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">In Asheron's Call, By Doogen 
    of Rithwic<br>
    ----------------------------------------------------------<br>
    In Asheron's Call, you may make a friend.<br>
    Sometimes friends wear Tangerine.<br>
    Friend might share a vision with you, of sharing, giving, teaching, and 
    having fun.<br>
    Or he may just buff you when you've decided that 40% would end your call.<br>
    Sometimes the call is about leadership and growth through giving yourself 
    away, and learning that in return you become more of a person when you give 
    yourself away.<br>
    <br>
    Or you may learn that even small archers can use a life wand.<br>
    You could run by a stranger in Glendon Wood, a little girl hunting rabbits 
    and drudges.<br>
    And instead of saying hello, you can heal her, because we all are mages 
    Zonata,<br>
    Some of us just deal with it better than others, right? <br>
    Then others become powerhouse archers dealing in life and magics easily as 
    an archer nocks a bow. <br>
    Healing others with a laugh, a smile, and a giggle or watching a sunset.<br>
    In this call, you can find a new friend.<br>
    <br>
    Or you can meet a friend who was there before you<br>
    And watch her fight as hard as someone can fight, <br>
    Despite not having the fastest connection to the 'net.<br>
    Congrats on the level Quietfire, I'm proud of you.<br>
    Sometimes the call is pure persistence and sticking to a goal<br>
    <br>
    And some days you'll learn that someone is your friend already,<br>
    Even if you haven't met her yet.<br>
    Simply because Dacia is a friend - was your friend already, <br>
    the moment you joined the allegiance.<br>
    In the call you're simply accepted and embraced.<br>
    <br>
    And a child can be your fellow-mate.<br>
    And a teenager can teach you something about yourself.<br>
    And you can have fun.<br>
    And learning the game can be a game.<br>
    And teaching the game within the game can be a game.<br>
    And dealing with others outside your group can be the game that you teach 
    others to game.<br>
    And you can trade. And you lose. And you earn. And you give. And you laugh. 
    Out loud. Rolling on the floor. Because the call IS tangible. It's a 
    game-shaped experience that will never be stolen or grieved. <br>
    <br>
    Because in Asheron's call you can decide in an October to learn a quest.<br>
    In the call you can learn how to lead a four-hour Adventure.<br>
    And you can talk a wisp killer they call Leslieo, a Milgan-shaped tank, and 
    something they call a Wei... <br>
    Into learning that adventure with you.<br>
    Oh sure, they might think you know what you're doing.<br>
    Then six months later you can look back and see just how much fun you 
    experienced.<br>
    Learning how to kill a Lady and an Ejan-shaped Smith.<br>
    <br>
    Because Dereth is a world, and for part of my day, all the doogs are in it.
    <br>
    We don't know what a doog is, but we know... that Doogs ARE everywhere.<br>
    And Doogs are a collective<br>
    And Damonarchy is an allegiance of collectives, some of which are doog-shaped, 
    whatever that is.<br>
    <br>
    In Asheron's call you can join a thing when it's 110 big.<br>
    And you can become a leader when it hits 500 small.<br>
    And you can try to influence it with a thing like a chain at 1,500 wide.<br>
    And you can realize it's not built out of chains.<br>
    That it doesn't rely on lines or weak links.<br>
    Rather it's a mesh of people and things and events and doing quests 
    every week for 100 weeks. It's not about exp, it's what happens while exp 
    magically appears out of thin air. And it's big and small and tall and wide. 
    It's a call.<br>
    <br>
    It's a person and a collective and an allegiance and a quest and a trade 
    and a loss and a friend and a buff and a guy named Buf. It's a Dumble who 
    dores, a Way who showers, a talking-thing made of Shon, a house with twenty 
    golden gromnie-cornerstones. It's a fellow and a shout to a Jack shaped cat. 
    It's a hi and a hi ho, it's a sub-shaped hub. It's a journey to a pit that 
    is ninety minutes to run or a bot that gets you there in a Roila shaped 
    call. It's the Ender you all never met, the Griff who came back, an 
    Exodus-shaped Andy, and a Furby hunting Kil Ho Gal gal drooling on a J-made 
    acid quest that never really ends.<br>
    <br>
    In my Asheron's Call, Damonarchy is the family in the game that's the 
    pastime that is the call. </font></span>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Dear Fellow clan members, Monarch and my closest 
    friends,<br>
    The reason why I (Dark Blood Knight and Spirit Fire) like Damonarchy is 
    because I have never met such finer people in my life.... I was level 25 when 
    my patron's patron swore to Danier. I had my doubts about Danier at first 
    cause I was a Wren the Blurry fan.... I am glad to say all the people 
    of Damonarchy, including Danier himself, have helped me on many occasions. For 
    that I am VERY grateful. I plan on being in Damonarchy for a very long time 
    and plan to be high level so I may one day help the ones that helped me... 
    Thank you Guys!<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Well, where do I begin? I have tons of friends 
    in AC and tons of friends in this clan. And I've lost a few good ones along 
    the way.<br>
    <br>
    I've been playing AC for over 3 years now and I've been in a total of 5 
    clans. Each had their own distinct personality and each had their strengths 
    and their downsides. I can often be heard telling other people that this 
    clan is great, but I don't often sit down and try to distill my feelings 
    into a few words. I think it comes down to one word, really: community. 
    DaMonarchy is a large community chock full of people that make you want to 
    come back to the Call again and again.<br>
    <br>
    Danier leads this group with an equable hand and a steady head. If you 
    wonder where all the exp goes that we send his way, he has to be pouring it 
    all into patience. Yet, he greets us each and every day with a hearty Hi Ho 
    and a &lt;g&gt; and is always ready for the next quest, the next recovery or 
    simply to give some great advice.<br>
    <br>
    I hate to start mentioning names for fear I'll miss someone, because each of 
    us makes this the best clan in AC, period, every day. From my cherished 
    patron, Galfrida, who has already received more accolades from others than I 
    can match, to the irrepressible Pet; everyone gives of themselves in the 
    most positive way and the clan just keeps getting better.<br>
    <br>
    To borrow from a couple of other posts the clan is a mesh of people who are 
    having so much fun they barely notice all the quests and all the experience 
    pouring in. It's about everyone not forgetting they are still human and 
    humor is really the best therapy for all of us.<br>
    <br>
    I'm more than proud, I'm honored, to have my name associated with this clan, 
    with Danier as Monarch and all the happy DaMonarchians.<br>

    <br>
    I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I've been in more then 
    one Guild. Large ones, small ones. I once took a break from AC, and when I 
    came back after roughly 6 months, I joined Damonarchy.<br>
    <br>
    I've been impressed by the morals of all the people I have met, the kindness, 
    honor and all around willingness to help out. Also I'm impressed by the 
    leadership of Danier and Doog. I cannot for the life of me understand how 
    they do it, but they do! Kudos to them!<br>
    <br>
    Up till now it has been a real pleasure to be a part of this clan, and I'm 
    here to stay ;)<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Well it is about time for me to ring in my thoughts about Damonarchy. First 
    let me explain how I came to meet Danier and the bunch I am proud to call my 
    friends in family on Dereth. I started Playing AC shortly after retail. A RL 
    friend and I decided to 
    make a run for a fort northwest of Zaikhal where we met this nice guy named Saturos. Bayud swore to Saturos.I hadn't actually met him yet so 
    I had doubts, but I trusted Bayud's judgment 
    on this. After actually meeting Saturos, I came to like him. At the time I 
    joined, Danier had not actually taken on the role of Monarch yet. At that time Axident was monarch. Saturos told us to go see Danier in GW he would be able to 
    give us advice about where to hunt for pyrerals. That is how I came to know 
    Dan and to join Damonarchy.  </font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="arial" size="2">My 
    time here has been long and I enjoy the company of every member of 
    Damonarchy each and every day I log in. If I could escape reality, I would 
    like it to be in AC where my new found friends and family are. Dan has 
    helped me a lot and through some rough times when I was ready to call it 
    quits. Doog, who is always there to help, has also helped me in a few 
    pinches. In turn, I try to repay them by helping as many others in Damonarchy 
    as I can. In fact I have made it my personal mission to log on each and every patch 
    day to brave the bad things that will happen and the bugs to learn the new 
    quests and to get Information on the new items or special lore so I can share it 
    with the Monarchy. </font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="arial" size="2">I'd like to make a few special mentions:<br>

    Doogens Mage -- I know he has to be tired of my endless ramblings and all my 
    questions.<br>
    Danier -- An all around great guy. Wouldn't trade in his Monarchy if I was

    to.<br>
    Bladen -- what can I say. We think alike at times. <br>
    Joshy's Mage -- My RL cousin(*peeks over to make sure Joshy isn't seeing him

    Logan Ryu -- well. he is just Logan.<br>
    Tyrion the Swift -- good chap and great friend.<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">**********</font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
    <font face="arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
    Here is a little story about how I met and eventually joined the clan of 
    Danier.<br>
    <br>
    My interest first peaked about AC while I was playing Spades and Eukere on 
    the zone around February of 2000. I kept seeing over 12,000 people logged 
    into Asheron's Call. Well, I couldn't resist temptation and bought AC. <br>
    <br>
    After experimenting with a template or two, I created Dacia and have been 
    playing her ever since. I have to admit, the first month I played was a bit 
    boring and I contemplated giving up (no monarchy or patron, no one to ask 
    advise from). <br>
    <br>
    I bless the day I wound up in Holt and met Southern. We kept running into 
    each other at the Holt dungeon and eventually just started hunting together. 
    Southern swore to me and had his RL son Hinoth swear to me too. One day we 
    got brave and decided to run to GW. We were both around level 9 or 10 at the 
    time and the run was brutal. So, there we were in GW, looking for something 
    to do. The next thing I remember is having a couple bodies in Daiklos 
    dungeon and wondering how I was going to get them back.
    Enter Validen (I am ashamed to admit I can not remember the rest of his 
    name). Well, Validen helped me and Southern with the bodies and spent a 
    short time talking about his monarchy. I have to admit I was intrigued. 
    Southern and I talked it over (we kept running into Validen &lt;g&gt;) and decided 
    to meet some of the members. <br>
    <br>
    At this time Danier was the monarch and had about 150 followers. After 
    meeting some of the clan, Validen talked to Om, and Om generously agreed let 
    me swear, placing me under AJ-Heart. And I must say, once I joined the clan, 
    I was thoroughly addicted. <br>
    <br>
    Om and Aj were wonderful. They would take me all over the place, listening 
    to me beg to go along, telling them that I would be ok, when they knew the 
    area would be certain death for me. They would try to discourage me, but I 
    persisted, and when I died, they camped my body because I couldn't make the 
    run back to where it was without leaving a breadcrumb trail of bodies in my 
    wake.<br>
    <br>
    So for me, I would have to say the People of the Clan are what I love most 
    about Damonarchy. The range and diversity of experience both in game and in 
    RL is just amazing. <br>
    <br>
    One of the other things I love is the patience I encountered. I didn't have 
    item magic until I was level 32. Let me tell you, that made questing 
    interesting. I honestly think that someone was appointed my portal keeper 
    until I trained Item magic!! (finding myself at Teth BSD more than once

    I'm sure I could fill an entire page full of one word reasons why I truly 
    love and appreciate this group. The comraderie, family atmosphere, group 
    hunts, weekend quests, generosity, and most importantly, the excellent 
    leadership.<br>
    I for one, have never played with another monarchy in the game. I've met a 
    quite a few members of other clans and interact regularly with many; some 
    more pleasant than others. For this reason, I will not stake a claim that we 
    are the best monarchy on the server or get into any sort of debate over the 
    matter. What I will say is that I have yet to see a monarchy that rivals our 
    leadership roles.  </font></span><p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">Danier and Doogens Mage set a great example for how 
    DaMonarchy is perceived around Dereth. When a conflict arises, they propose 
    competent solutions. When someone needs help, they assist in any way they 
    can. Over the past 2 years, I've watched these actions overflow to everyone 
    that follows them. We are all generous to a certain extent, but with 
    role-models such as these two, it is so much easier to &quot;give the shirt off 
    of your back&quot;. Many a times I have witnessed vassals helping out their 
    patrons, players stopping just to say hello to another unknown member of the 
    clan, and just outright going out of their way to make a fellow DaMonarchian 
    have a better gaming experience. Even in responses that have been posted 
    about this topic, I witness people thanking others just because they have 
    another opportunity. Most would capitalize on the opportunity to be a part 
    of Maggie's wonderful site, yet they take more time to graciously thank and 
    praise fellow members. The closest trait that comes to mind is Humility, and 
    that is why I like Damonarchy.<br>
    <br>
    I'd like to share one of my many experiences with DaMonarchy. About a month 
    ago, I was honored to host a PK Tournament called King of DaMansion. It was 
    open to all members of the monarchy and took place within the confines of 
    our mansion, the basement to be exact. We had around 25-30 participants 
    ranging from level 50-110, from mage to melee, and most importantly, older 
    and younger members. I was so happy to see everyone gather and 
    lightheartedly tease each other as to the final outcome. There were some 
    secret alliances and deceitful tactics utilized by most, and in the end, Danier and Doogens Mage let us all experience the consequences of doubting 
    their supremacy as King and Right-Hand Man. I like to think that this 
    experience served as a great example of our compassion for one another as we 
    then fellowed, young and old, mage and melee, to rid ourselves of the vitae. 
    Thanks again for all the wonderful times of the past, present, and future.<br>

    <font face="arial" size="2">Hi Maggie! Why do I love Damonarchy? Well, 
    probably because it's just the best monarchy in the whole game, that's why. 
    Ok, WAIT ...I realize that was not a good way to put it, I mis-spoke, 
    forgive me. Damonarchy is, er, a very good monarchy! They have organized 
    hunts and quests, literally thousands of members, and there's always someone 
    around to help retrieve a corpse or two in a nasty situation. Does that 
    sound too enthusiastic? Let's just say, then, that they are not bad folks, 
    ok? <br>
    <br>
    I'm kidding, of course. I know you are a big fan of Damonarchy. After all, 
    you were the one who introduced me to Danier, Damonarchy's monarch.<br>
    <br>
    Actually, I suppose should mention that I am not formally a member of 
    Damonarchy. I mean I'm not a member at all! As you know, I belong to YOUR 
    monarchy, which is a very excellent one. I like your monarchy and always 
    have liked it. You are a fine monarch. As your only vassal, may I say that 
    things couldn't be better!<br>
    <br>
    Damonarchy is a pretty good runner-up, however. They have been kind enough 
    to make me a sort of Honorary Hanger-On, and I've had many fun and 
    stimulating experiences with them over the years. Innumerable Dead Neds have 
    been reclaimed through the force of Damonarchy arms and combat resources. 
    They have school spirit. <br>
    <br>
    In fact, as a total outsider, I really think I'm well qualified to recommend 
    this monarchy. Here are their strengths:<br>
    <br>
    * They spend an amazingly large amount of time PLAYING THE GAME, rather than 
    standing around the lifestone talking trash. This characteristic is often 
    overlooked when weighting the pros and cons of an allegiance, IMO. They play 
    a lot, and they seem to LIKE IT. Enjoyable play beats the buggerbits out of 
    tedious bad-tempered play. <br>
    <br>
    * They have relatively few MEETINGS. The importance of this cannot be 
    overemphasized. <br>
    <br>
    * They have little interest in ASSIGNING BLAME, and not much skill in doing 
    it, either. Such small blame as there might be is usually casually assigned 
    to the leadership, who seem to accept it as the unavoidable consequence of 
    competence and integrity. We could all learn from them. (The leadership, 
    that is.)<br>
    <br>
    * In situations where good preparation matters, such as dangerous quests, 
    they are well-prepared. They understand that there is a knack to managing 30 
    players in a dungeon. Practice makes proficient.<br>
    <br>
    * There are no Damonarchy members with serious unresolved psychological 
    issues that impair game play! This is wonderful news. No bossy fussbudget 
    know-it-alls, no mean-minded back stabbers, no pissy-ass peeps trying to 
    compensate for the flawed parenting they endured as children. They may be a 
    tad weird, but they show up at the dungeon ready for work and unburdened by 
    dig-me baggage. <br>
    <br>
    * Finally, their hearts are pretty much pure, and stout, and lion-like. They 
    are valiant warriors, imbued with courage. They are tenacious, never giving 
    up. They are loyal and true. They seem to care about one another. They are 
    crafty, ingenious and generally wicked-smart. They have high quality 
    equipment and frightening stats. In fact, Damonarchy may have the game's 
    only level 100+ mule. With a 400 cooking stat, I believe.<br>
    <br>
    That wraps it up, I think. Doogens Mage is a fine executive officer, always 
    ready to pretend that my errors are normal and the sort of thing that could 
    happen to anyone. Danier, the Monarch, is not quite able to go that far, but 
    he is nice enough! He is also a fine military strategist, a knowledgable 
    student of history, and he has 1839 Ned Cleversun corpses to his credit. 
    That's got to count for a lot. Er, I think he may have picked up a few 
    Jackcat corpses too!<br>
