        <span lang="en-us">The Silver Citadel allegiance is based on three core

    Rook and Trozan, it lays claim to being the oldest Monarchy in Dereth! The

    High Council, </span>a self<span lang="en-us">-</span>appointed body of five

    <br>
        <i>Written by Lord Ras,<br>
    a founding member and past High Council Member</i><br>
    <br>
        &quot;We have gone thru significant growth in the last few months, and learned a 
    lot about ourselves and what we want the Citadel to mean.<br>
    <br>
    For some its a chance to live according to a higher ideal, for others the 
    camaraderie of good friends, and for still others a source of knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    I write now from a very personal perspective, but those 3 goals are what 
    come to my mind when I think of the Citadel. You will notice that &quot;a source 
    of power and material gain&quot; are absent.<br>
    <br>
    I thought it might help some of us to hear the roots of the allegiance. For 
    indeed we have as rich and significant a history as any allegiance or entity 
    in Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    As many of you have noted, I am a man of many words, as is the tradition of 
    the great Gharu'ndim rawis who treat story-telling as a fine art.<br>
    <br>
    History and story-telling are the result of an organic process, so I invite 
    all my fellows to contribute to that they remember of our history.<br>
    <br>
    So without further ado... let the stories begin....&quot;<br>

        explorations. How they were approached by Sarneho to join the Advocacy, 
        sharing their stores of knowledge with newer Isparians. And how they

    -Lady Grasp (Loyal follower of the Silver Citadel)</span></i><p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us">&quot;I am tired, very tired. The trip back from Zakhail is a 
    blur. At one time it was a treacherous run. Now it is a simple matter of 
    dodging the groups of creatures. There is a party in Tou-tou that I am to 
    attend. Two members of our monarchy are getting married. This is the party 
    for the bride, called a shower for some reason. I am not much for parties. 
    An ale in smoky room with good friends to swap bawdy tales of adventures is 
    one thing, this is quite another matter. But Ras is a good friend, and I do 
    not wish to disappoint him. So instead of following my instinct of good 
    dinner followed by a blissful night's sleep, I am heading to the Tavern.<br>
    <br>
    <i>There are hidden towns in Dereth. Way off the beaten path, in the darkest 
    reaches. The stout peoples that settled these places are pioneers in the 
    true sense of the word. I had made it a mission to visit each of these 
    places. The most popular of them would be Stonehold. It lies in a beautiful 
    valley or North West Osteth. The beginning of the end of the quest for the 
    Sword of Lost Light is near there.</i><br>
    <br>
    The portal opens and sets me upon the road, the warm mist from the hot 
    spring tells I am near my destination. The leather worker is making some 
    piece of armor in his shop. I pick up my deadened legs and start the run to 
    town. I see the lamps of Tou-tou as I round the small hill. The sounds of 
    the merry making drifts to me on the air. An almost overwhelming feeling of 
    lethargy threatens to overtake me. I make sure I'm smiling and slow down to 
    enter the building. Before I can reach for the door, a message reaches me 
    from Empath, a fellow Silver Citadel member and an Archmage of no small 
    talent. He has gotten himself into deep trouble he needs help - a lot of 
    help. I feel a bit of guilt, this call for rescue will also rescue me from a 
    party. <br>
    <br>
    My body awakens anew to the call of danger. I clear my voice and announce 
    the need for some stout adventurers. As always, in Tou-tou, many answer the 
    call. Empath had been exploring the canyons that lead to the Obsidian 
    Plains, one of the most dangerous spots on Dereth. Soon the call is 
    answered: Cho'dan Tang, Arcumnus, Tark, Thyrion and Snyper, all fine 
    warriors of considerable talent. Their faces turn suddenly grim with 
    anticipation when I tell them where we are headed.&quot;</span><p align="left">

    Below are the Testimonials of TSC members. You will note some of those included are not positive and 
    glowing. I included these to put a real face upon our Monarchy. We are a 
    group of people who have come together under the Silver Citadel's creed of 
    Honor, Integrity and Loyalty. As a group we try to put the needs of others 
    before our own. We try to be a polite bunch and not &quot;Throw the first stone.&quot; 
    Sometimes we fail at this. I'd like to think the majority of the time we 
    succeed. Before the @corpse and @permit commands one of our members, Truehand, developed the 
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.silvercitadel.com/House_SCRS/scrs_web.asp">Silver Citadel Rescue Service</a>. It's not called upon 
    as much anymore, but it is still called upon. Through that and other acts by 
    our members we have enjoyed a good reputation on Leafcull.<br>
    <br>
    I love this Monarchy. The people I have met  and fought along side with are truly some of the noblest people I have ever come across in a game. Over 
    the years I have seen some come and go. Some I miss, others I have forgotten 
    (sad to say). What it all boils down to is entertainment. TSC offers a lot of 
    that, some good times, a few bad times. For me the good times are much much 
    more then the bad.<br>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">As I sit here and think about my time spent being part of The Silver 
    Citadel, one word comes to mind... Family. The friends I have made in this 
    allegiance are willing to do anything and everything for not only those who 
    wave the TSC flag, but other citizens of Dereth as well. We put others first 
    before ourselves, almost always without question, and that is what 
    solidified my decision to join and remain TSC. In my opinion, we are a well 
    respected monarchy, known for being a very trustworthy folk who will go 
    above and beyond to ensure that what we do is not only honorable, but will 
    leave a lasting impression on others as well. <br>
    <br>
    Members such as Lord Tex, Cyricx, Grasp, Guardia, Mage Exitilus, Tibbet 
    Tallfellow, Paksenarrion, Empath, and countless others have gone above and 
    beyond the call of duty to ensure that this monarchy is something to be 
    proud of. I could name an extensive amount of others, but that is not what 
    we are all about... we don't have one glaring member that stands above the 
    rest, we all work together as one large family. That is why that one word, 
    family, describes our monarchy best, I believe. <br>
    <br>
    Honor, Integrity, and Loyalty, these three words are what we are all about. 
    This code, if you will, is what we all live by. Each day, one of us 
    contributes to this code, and that is what helps The Silver Citadel grow to 
    be such a strong allegiance. I can not begin to count the times that I have 
    been asked to be a &quot;third party&quot; in a trade, or been asked to help another 
    mule who was not a member of The Silver Citadel allegiance. Each and every 
    time the same statement from these individuals was made... &quot;You are TSC, a 
    well respected and honest monarchy, that is why I ask for your help.&quot; That 
    truly makes me proud.<br>
    <br>
    The patron-vassal relationships that exist in TSC is yet another reason that 
    makes this monarchy so special, in my opinion. We all have always put a 
    great deal of emphasis on maintaining a positive, close knit relationship 
    for the patron and his/her vassals. For instance, my vassals refer to our 
    bunch as &quot;The Family,&quot; which makes me very proud. We, just like our entire 
    monarchy, are a very close bunch, willing to drop anything and everything to 
    help a brother or sister who needs assistance. That is what we are all 
    about. That is what we strive for on a daily basis. And that is why I am a 
    proud member of The Silver Citadel.<br>

    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Why am I in TSC? <br>
    <br>
    The answer for me is part of a journey.<br>
    <br>
    When I first started playing back in August of 2000, I knew nothing about the 
    game. It wasn't until after I was level 15 that my first patron realized I 
    didn't know how to run and talk at the same time, so he taught me about the 
    'Q' autorun.<br>
    <br>
    I had some RL friends (IG -&gt; Niamu Zharan and Wigliff the Viking) that 
    started me on my way to understanding. They took me out for my first Lugian 
    hunting as well as several other firsts. They were TSC - I wasn't.<br>
    <br>
    During my time with my first patron I learned a bit and was given some good 
    armor to keep me alive, but really felt I was hunting solo. There was a 
    change in my first allegiance and it was then I got my first interactive 
    patron (Zhou En-Lai). <br>
    <br>
    He hunted with me and tried very hard to keep me equipped as correct for my 
    level. He was also my first real friend in AC.<br>
    <br>
    After growing with him for a long time I felt I had to grow in a different 
    direction. He is still someone I respect greatly and talk to. <br>
    <br>
    Throughout all of this I had kept that IG friendship with Niamu up. We had 
    been talking a lot about what The Silver Citadel stood for. I liked the Code 
    of Conduct as well as the benefits like the rescue service and the active 
    questing.<br>
    <br>
    I made a decision to become a part of it then. The hard part was having to 
    level Niamu up high enough so I could swear to her. She had fallen several 
    levels behind me so that took about a week, but when she and I were equal in 
    levels, I offered my service as vassal. <br>
    <br>
    I met a few people early on that made very good impressions on me. All 
    through my travels I had heard that &quot;TSC has a cool rep&quot;. I was starting 
    to see why. People helped each other for no other reason than to help.<br>
    <br>
    My growth in the Allegiance brought me to a point where I wanted to offer my 
    energy to help lead. After some soul searching I applied to be a member of 
    The Silver Citadel High Council. Some time later I was admitted to this fine 
    group.<br>
    <br>
    The High Council acts as the leadership for the Allegiance. I had watched 
    them in the meetings and thought I could add something. I was very wrong in 
    what I thought. <br>
    <br>
    The High Council is one of the toughest jobs I have been a part of. It is 
    also one of the most rewarding. I finally get to actively be a part of the 
    growth of an Allegiance that gave me a home and a family.<br>
    <br>
    That last ... the home and family .... that is why I wanted to become and 
    why I actively am part of The Silver Citadel.<br>
    <br>
    Humbly,<br>

    <p align="center"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">**********</font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I play AC for the role-playing. I got hack and slash in several other games, 
    but never had the interaction with others and the opportunity to really step 
    into a spirit other than myself. When I came to Leafcull, I came from 
    another server and another monarchy and I came for a reason. I wanted to 
    build a monarchy of my own. A monarchy unlike any that I’d seen. A monarchy 
    based on values and virtues. I wanted to create a neo-Camelot, a Round Table 
    of adventurers that would be renowned for being upstanding and trustworthy, 
    the people others would go to for help knowing that they’d get it without 
    question.  </font></span>
    <p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I was approached frequently to join this or that monarchy and I 
    rebuffed them all. After asking several times, one person changed tack and 
    asked me to come meet his family and friends which I recognized as a prelude 
    to asking again to vassal to him. Out of respect I went and met some folks 
    and he introduced me to one Tibbet Tallfellow. To say I was unimpressed by a 
    level 107 taking time to speak with a level 13 would not be an 
    understatement, but what did impress me was his gracious acceptance of my 
    questions. I figured I would remove any reasons for joining this allegiance 
    by pointed questions designed to show the flaws in it. I was flummoxed by 
    the ease with which he took away every possible objection. I realized that 
    The Silver Citadel was the neo-Camelot I wanted to build. Rather than 
    “reinvent the wheel” I swore into TSC. This was not eagerly welcomed by the 
    vassals I currently had, but I was able to transmit to them the sense that I 
    had and the security that it was the right move. <br>
    <br>
    The Silver Citadel is a loose corporation of people who subscribe to what 
    are purported to be common values and virtues ~ Honor, Integrity, and 
    Loyalty. The degree to which the membership adheres to those values and even 
    agrees upon a definition is always in flux, but that’s normal. I can speak 
    only for myself and my group ~ these values are the core of who we are and 
    what we do. We value our membership in TSC and bear the badge proudly as 
    it’s a mark of distinction and a visible signifier that we live by a code of 
    ethics.<br>
    <br>
    Of the 4 Monarchies that I’ve participated in TSC is by far the most 
    organized. The resources needed to succeed in Dereth are laid out for any 
    and all to take. Only those who choose to fail fail. Equipment is free to 
    those who ask. Experience costs only the patience and time it takes to earn 
    it. If one needs help in leveling, there are always many ready and waiting to 
    assist. There is a generosity and sense of family that I haven’t found in 
    many other groups. It’s this family bond, a caring that goes beyond who 
    provides what to whom how often, that makes TSC what it is and keeps me and 
    mine in it.<br>

    TSC. <br>
    <br>
    When we started playing we had a RL friend who introduced us to the game. We 
    were invited to join TSC but I wanted to test the waters a bit. I did base 
    myself in Tou-Tou but waited and watched and played.<br>
    <br>
    Later, I joined TSC (and then rejoined when my patron's patron left, after 
    considering other options) for these reasons:<br>
    <br>
    My character stands for those honorable TSC traits whether or not she is TSC.<br>
    <br>
    There are MANY in TSC who do indeed follow the intent of our creed. I am 
    honored to know a good number of them.<br>
    <br>
    I know that when I am in serious need of assistance (which is rare and 
    therefore truly serious ;) I can find it. And have found it sometimes 
    without much looking and from members I didn't know.<br>
    <br>
    I am not alone. I can recruit others to join me in hunting or ask to join 
    them. I can post in the forums when I wish to start/join a quest, ask a 
    question, etc. I can yell to the rescue service for aide (though have never 
    had to, have always found someone jumping to my assistance).<br>

    No political BS along the way. Ur all just very cool and I love being a part 
    of it! <br>

    Code of Conduct is actually stricter than the rules of the game. So people 
    who aren't TSC would *seem* to have advantages over us. <br>
    <br>
    Yet TSCers wind up with everything they need, with surpluses for their allies 
    and strangers. It's almost an embarrassment of riches.<br>
    <br>
    If you have any exposure to spiritual principles such as The Middle Way, 
    Karma, or Random Acts of Kindness, the TSC experience just seems to prove 
    these principles work (at least in Dereth).<br>
    <br>
    If you've ever played factions in Planescape, the closest faction to TSC is 
    the sect known as The Ring Givers. Logically, the Ring Givers philosophy 
    SHOULDN'T work, but it does (often thanks to GM intervention). What is 
    amazing to me is that we have no GM making our philosophy work in Dereth. It 
    just works.<br>
    <br>
    I've received all the usual nice stuff from patron, grand patron and great 
    grand patron, and have passed stuff down my allegiance tree.<br>
    <br>
    But the amazing part is the stuff for which there is no possible quid pro 
    quo.<br>
    <br>
    At least 3 of the matty robes I've given away weren't to my followers.<br>
    <br>
    I've been given a Diamond Shield, I've been given GSA. I've given and been 
    given more gifts than I could possibly remember, all without asking for it 
    or being asked for it.<br>
    <br>
    There's more to TSC than mere generosity, and people who think TSC 
    membership is some kind of shortcut to actually developing their character 
    through hunting and questing and crafting are usually disappointed (because 
    they are usually transparent), but there really is something magic about the 
    generosity of TSC and how it just works.<br>
    <br>
    I quit a MMORPG that I thought was better than AC simply because I missed 
    the TSC experience. <br>

    Basically, you can find anything your looking for here.<br>
    <br>
    You can be &quot;in&quot;, you can be &quot;out&quot;, you can be recognized by the group in 
    whole, you can find a small group of friends that has little to do with the 
    monarchy at all.<br>
    <br>
    You can be recognized, you can be ignored. You can be appreciated, you can 
    be taken for granted. You can be happy with the status quo, you can rail for 
    something different.<br>
    <br>
    We are a group of diverse people that overall provide a network of aid for 
    almost every circumstance that comes up. If you stick around long enough, 
    you will be grateful as well as disappointed.<br>
    <br>
    TSC is not a perfect place, but in my opinion, it is a very good place to 
    be. Take advantage of what adds to your game-play and recognize that not 
    everything that goes on is what would take place in a perfect world.<br>
    <br>
    My time in Dereth has been improved by being a part of this group. Not every 
    experience has been positive, but I have found friends that I can 
    consistently depend on. TSC is where I plan to stay and where I plan to move 
    forward when AC2 comes out.<br>

    this wonderful allegiance (or really anything, heh). But one day a kind 
    stranger took me hunting on Tou-Tou beach, just because she was nice...
    <br>
    <br>
    She was not a person trying to get vassals and make tons of XP... she was a 
    kind, loving person trying to help, and have fun. She helped me recover 
    bodies, helped me level, showed me new and exciting things! I had a 
    wonderful time with her and her friends in Asheron's Call.<br>
    <br>
    Later I swore to this wonderful person, and have been under her ever since. 
    I did not swear to her because of the group we are in. I swore to her 
    because she was kind, and so were all the other people in the allegiance she 
    was in. <br>
    <br>
    Who cares if we do a lot of quests, or have a ton of members. What really 
    matters is the great people who are there to help, have fun, and enjoy this 
    game with others.<br>
    <br>
    That is what makes our allegiance truly awesome and why I love being in it! 
    :)<br>

    love a lot of the people in TSC. I have met people whom I can call a friend 
    and trust. People there for me not only for IG issues but RL issues as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some of the Members in TSC that I have met have been some of the greatest 
    friends and people that I have known. I have always loved the foundation and 
    way TSC has been built upon. The Rescue Service, people always available to 
    help those in Need. The High Council. Spending their free time to help 
    control the Members of TSC. A Monarchy still built upon the Patron/Vassal 
    relationship.<br>
    <br>
    For some time now I have seen the spirit of TSC begin to fade in its new 
    members. The new patrons/vassals of TSC are not being taught the Honor, 
    Integrity and Loyalty TSC once had.<br>
    <br>
    Honestly there is only 2 reasons I have not left TSC IMO, and that is 
    because of my patron Mezlik. Since day 1 I have sworn to him, he has been 
    the best patron and a great friend. I am a solo type person. Rarely do I 
    want or need help. But when I need it, Mezlik is there. I would not leave 
    Mezlik's side unless I was forced to. Other than that, my loyalty is with 
    him, and shall remain wherever he shall go.<br>
    <br>
    2nd reason is my friends in TSC. A list that is quite long but still, these 
    are great people to me. For these 2 reasons I shall remain TSC.<br>

    <p align="center"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">**********</font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am reposting a letter I wrote 
    in August 2000, in its entirety. I still feel the same as I did 
    when I wrote the post though my patron has left, and RL has me playing at 
    the oddest hours, making socializing with some of my friends in game is 
    virtually impossible nowadays.<br>
    <br>
    Here it is (notice the &quot;newbieness&quot; of my letter. I did not know the term 
    &quot;tank&quot; yet. BTW Suella, I'm still using your nephew's account that you gave 
    to me.):<br>
    <br>
    Hail brothers and sisters of the Silver Citadel!<br>
    <br>
    While this character has only been a member of The Silver Citadel for a few 
    days, I played for over a month as Arioch DeadEye (thanks Edo!), so 
    technically I’m not a new member.<br>
    <br>
    I am using this opportunity to sing the praises of TSC, for without the 
    fellowship, mentorship and camaraderie I received as Arioch, I never would 
    have purchased AC, and DEFINITELY would not be playing it anymore.<br>
    <br>
    When I first heard of AC, read reviews, and saw screenshots, I was not 
    really impressed. I was mostly turned off by not being able to play demi-human 
    characters.<br>
    <br>
    But Edo loved the concept, and bought the game. I watched over his shoulder 
    for hours as he played. I also created, and played (albeit seldom) Arioch, 
    but still, I was not impressed with the game.<br>
    <br>
    Until Edo became a member of TSC, however. I watched him meet, hunt, and 
    form great relationships with Guardia, Dragonlady, Coyote, and most 
    recently, DJCrom and Suella.<br>
    <br>
    I was fascinated mostly by the way members went out of their way to rescue 
    fellow members, or help recover, or just replace hopelessly lost items.<br>
    <br>
    On my way to Tou-Tou to become a member (as a 3rd level Arioch), I got lost, 
    died and lost an Othoi sword (my ONLY sword at the time). I re-spawned in 
    Nanto, and started asking around for help recovering it.<br>
    <br>
    I received very rude and lewd responses from many of the players there, 
    until I met Warbin, Arioch’s future patron. He buffed me and escorted to 
    where my body was. He even stood there and lured baddies to him as I labored 
    along the trail. Remember – he was only a 9th (or was it 12th?) level mage 
    at the time, so he must have taken a beating.<br>
    <br>
    Well, we couldn’t find my body, and he offered me one of his swords to 
    replace the one I had lost. When we got to the Tou-Tou tavern, I swore 
    allegiance to him, and I have never regretted it. It is safe to say the 
    without The Silver Citadel, I wouldn’t have even bought AC – it is what 
    makes the game worthwhile and enjoyable to me.<br>
    <br>
    So, while our kingdom may not be perfect, many members truly embody the Code 
    of Honor that we swear by, and The Silver Citadel truly is the greatest 
    kingdom in all Dereth. I have been to many other towns, and encountered many 
    other Monarchies, but you will NEVER find anything as honorable and virtuous 
    as TSC.<br>
    <br>
    Special thanks to:<br>
    Edo the Dragon, Warbin, Blade Force, Coyote the Trixter, Dragonlady, 
    Echohawk, Omen Istar, Suella, Guardia, and many, many others for being the 
    wonderful, noble TSC members that you are! <br>
    <br>
    Keep up the good work everyone – I can only imagine how many other people 
    are watching a friend play AC, just looking for a reason to play – looking 
    for people like you in The Silver Citadel.<br>

    The Sliver Citadel dead on the toilet</font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">
    This was a practical joke done on April fools day. For the longest time the 
    High Council had been inundated with questions about our figurehead monarch. 
    When our regular Sunday meeting was to be on April Fools day, it seemed 
    natural to come up with something. One of the HC created a new account 
    called The SLIVER Citadel (10 10 10 10 10 10 template with no skills spec or 
    trained) and we portalled him to the Tou-Tou meeting hall, dressed him in 
    Hoorys and set him up. </font></span>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="TSC/Sliver.JPG" width="300" height="306"><p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">
    While goofing around he ventured too close to the stench in the water 
    closet. Well the meeting arrived and we asked if people wanted to see the 
    Silver Citadel, they responded Yes! And the following announcement was made 
    &quot;Summon the Sliver Citadel&quot; He logged in and among the LOL's he proceeded to 
    beg for Loot using the infamous l33+ speech, until he used the old @lifestone 
    command.<br>
    <br>
    -Grasp</font></span><p align="center"><span lang="en-us"><font face="arial" size="2">**********</font></span><p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I really enjoy being a part of TSC and feel very honored to participate. It 
    is hard to put the reasons into words. <br>
    <br>
    If I had to use one word it would be unselfishness. The members of TSC place 
    their comrades above their own interests.<br>
    <br>
    I have never been a member of any other allegiance, and I never plan to try 
    any other allegiance as long as I am on Leafcull.<br>
    <br>
    I do not regret the fact that some people have left us. <br>
    <br>
    I miss some of the people who have left us, but I figure most of them are on 
    a different journey than I am, and are free to explore their own paths. <br>
    <br>
    In some rare cases we had people leave in disgust. IMO they were people who 
    did not understand that we constantly change as long as we keep bringing in 
    new people. This is just the way things are in any society; new people bring 
    in fresh ideas. <br>
    <br>
    Some folks did not like the fact that new people did not know anything about 
    the old people ... unless they were like Tex and remained active and caring. 
    You reap what you sow, and if you stop sowing, you will feel you have become 
    unknown and people lack respect for you. In this allegiance you can never 
    rest on your laurels.<br>
    <br>
    The one thing that has never ever changed in the TSC is the upfront code of 
    conduct, and the love everyone has of their comrade. I do not know how this 
    has gone on for so long. <br>
    <br>
    I think it is pure magic.<br>
