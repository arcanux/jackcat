    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Membership requirements:</b><br>
	We do not allow stealing, griefing, or harassing of other players. We ask 
	that all members be courteous and helpful to others, and above all possess a 
	well developed desire to have fun!<br>
	<br>
	<b>About the Monarchy:<br>
	</b>By KellyRose, vassal of Enzymatic)<br>
	<br>
	We focus on having fun, whether it’s out questing or recovering bodies from 
	VoD. We also plan non-combat fun. Our guild has had two home tours and a 
	fashion show. <br>
	<br>
	The home tour is a way for guild mates to show off their homes and their 
	decorating styles (or lack there of). Everyone is responsible for grabbing 
	the portal to his or her particular settlement and we just go hopping from 
	place to place. It’s generated a new enthusiasm for older quests because we 
	see things at other people’s houses that we don’t have!<br>
	<br>
	The fashion show, at first, didn’t generate too much interest … that is 
	until the night of the show. We had several different categories and fellow 
	guild mates, Meriven and Kellyrose outdid themselves with their variety in 
	apparel. The event was enjoyed so much by everyone we have plans to host one 
	server wide and invite other guilds to join us.<br>
	<br>
	I like the fact that we're a family, and we all take care of each other just 
	like a family would. If you start a new character you can always find a 
	higher level clan mate that will go out hunting with you to help you get 
	over that “I die every time I step away from the mansion” period in a 
	newbie’s life. The biggest gift of this clan is that no call for help is 
	left unanswered.<br>
	<br>
	It is filled with really good people who go out of their way to help and 
	most have a very well developed sense of humor.<br>
	<br>
	One example of the incredible people in our clan is the night Ogzmandius 
	took me on a quest ... I think it was to the crystal dungeons. Anyway it was 
	where you have to hop from one floating platform to another to enter the 
	right portal. It took me a full set of buffs to learn how to hop instead of 
	launch myself in to space! But now I can hop, skip, AND jump thanks to Ogz's 
	patience.<br>
	<br>
	Then there's the prankster side of our monarch(y). One night our monarch 
	took me out to meet Pookie, the rabid bunny. I knew I wasn't supposed to id 
	the creature and I have to say, I was totally unimpressed with him. He's 
	just a wee lil white bunny, after all. Then another clan member showed up, 
	and in a nefarious plot suggested that Tiger back up while he ID'd Pookie. 
	Well I guess you know who was the first tasty morsel Pookie found at the 
	mouth of his cave? Yours truly! Of course I wasn't quite prepared to have 
	this lil fluffball attacking me, and I didn't know where Tiger or the punk 
	were so instead of just running away I tried running in circles around the 
	cave. Alas, four voracious nibbles later I was dead. I just love providing 
	the clan with such a wealth of entertainment.</font></span></p>
