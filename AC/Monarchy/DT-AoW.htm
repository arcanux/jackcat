    </font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Our Goal:</b><br>
    &quot;Angels of War&quot; in a new Darktide guild based on the strengt<span lang="en-us">h</span>s 
    of Anti-PK's in a world currently filled with cheating and evil. We are the 
    force of good trying to overcome difficult odds through team work, 
    intelligence, and <span lang="en-us">perseverance.</span><br>
    <br>
    While this goal is not an easy one, we strive foremost to have fun! This is 
    a game. We want everyone to take it seriously, but still enjoy it as a 
    hobby, and making new friends in our guild to enjoy the game with. We 
    promote an enjoyable gaming atmosphere with our every effort.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Our Home:</b><br>
    Unlike many <span lang="en-us">cowardly</span> players on Darktide, we have 
    no shame in our guild to make us hide under a rock like a snake. We live in 
    the beautiful mounta<span lang="en-us">i</span>n filled countryside of 
    Stonehold, about 40 clicks northwest of Zaikhal. We have several lifestone 
    estates to pick from as well. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Our Honor:</b><br>
    While we reserve our rules to a little privacy for our own vassals, we DO 
    have them. We are not a cheating guild. If you see something you do not feel 
    is fair, feel free to voice it to us and we will do our best to show what 
    honorable players we are. Some examples of the cheating we do not allow are 
    portal logging, duplicating items, and speed altering programs. <br>
    <br>
    We are also Anti-RPK. We do not random player kill. We are not passive, 
    however. We will attack you if you have given us reason, or if your fellow 
    clansman ha<span lang="en-us">s</span> given us reason. We will respect you 
    as a player if you are a member of our clan or not. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Why?:</b><br>
    We are Anti-RPK, because we feel that running around and killing everyone 
    you see just to run away when you will be beaten is unjust. We are proud to 
    be protectors of that justice. <br>
    <br>
    We do not cheat because we want to set a good example instead of following a 
    bad one, so we do not allow the cheats mentioned. We prefer to win the way 
    the game was designed. <br>
    <br>
    What sets us apart from other Anti-PK and Neutral clans on Darktide? We'll 
    let you be the judge of that. </font></p>

    (Cabinet-Public Relations and Core)</b><br>
    <br>
    True Orb, whose name was taken from a sacred and ancient Sho clan, grew up 
    in the vast plains of Ispar. He was named True Orb, as his fighting for his 
    village and allies was unmatched by any other, and his every word that of 
    honesty (which sometimes got him in trouble). His real name is unknown, as 
    he has told only a handful of his fellows in the world of Dereth. He was the 
    only son of his father, Tha-Tzi-Tsung, who also fathered a daughter. His 
    mother died during his sister’s childbirth, and his father raised the two.<br>
    <br>
    True Orb was trained early on as a martial artist, being accepted into his 
    father’s clan at a young age, taking part in the rigorous training as an 
    assassin, spy, and warrior. The clan is dark and mysterious, embracing the 
    night as its key power. However the group’s intentions are to serve justice.<br>
    <br>
    At age seventeen, when True Orb was hunting, his village was slain by a 
    group of rebels loyal to an evil monarch. His father defended the town 
    admirably with his sword, but he and his brethren were killed by the masses 
    of enemies. In the battle, Tha-Tzi’s daughter, only 13 years of age, fled 
    and was not to be seen again. However, it is rumored that she was a great 
    archer and mage, and had followed in her brother’s footsteps to Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    Upon returning to his burned village and injured people, Orb fell victim to 
    the curse of vengeance and rage. At this, he vowed to serve his clan as a 
    warrior to all who wish for peace. True was given a small army of the finest 
    trained warriors in the land, and they set out to destroy the army which 
    slaughtered their families.<br>
    <br>
    Soon after he made a trip to Glenden Wood, where he met and swore allegiance 
    to a powerful archer named Fishy Master, a name given to him back on Ispar 
    as a local fisherman. Orb soon outgrew his patron, and eventually followed 
    another portal that would change his life, this time, with a good friend 
    named Notxed. Together they navigated their way through the mountainous 
    terrain and dangerous monsters to a small town known as Stonehold, where 
    both still reside. Over time the town has become a haven for adventurers 
    seeking to enforce justice. Side effects from his trip to Dereth caused him 
    to forgot his real name. He continues to wonder about his sister, though she 
    may be closer to him than he thinks.<br>
    ----------<br>
    <br>
    A note from True Orb: I did not take part in this guild for no reason. The 
    guild was the product of a merger between my old guild called Brotherhood of 
    Powers (another composite guild), and the Souls of R A. We came together to 
    show people that there ARE clans out there that take it very seriously to 
    only have fair and enjoyable players in their ranks. <br>

    Master Scout)</b><br>
    <br>
    Goldplate, one of the guild's younger members, is Sho Isparian by heritage 
    but was actually born on Dereth. Named after the obscure legend of the 
    Dragon-Marked, Goldplate trained in the ways of magic resistance. During his 
    days as a mercenary, he gained friends within the Forgotten Souls of Sun 
    Jian. Goldplate was taught the art of magic and quickly grew in strength as 
    well in his ability to resist the negative spells of others. He also soon 
    realized his hate of fighting, but resolved to help his guild in other ways 
    as a scout. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">After the death of their 
    leader, Sun Jian, massive morale was lost within the guild. Goldplate swore 
    to help those who had helped him so much, and petitioned to become part of 
    the Ronin guild's core, in spite of his youthful age. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">As Core, Goldplate served as 
    a Head Scout, fearlessly crossing the deadly lands of Dereth to bring back 
    much needed information and portal ties. He was also a strengthener of 
    morale, always quick with a joke and always willing to help, even if it was 
    out of his way. The Ronin guild, now calling itself the Souls of RA, moved 
    throughout the land until they reached the small town of Stonehold. There 
    they found the Brotherhood of Power, who had numerous friends among members 
    of the Ronin Guild and with whom Goldplate had fought on occasion. After 
    many successful fights, defending the town alongside each other, the Souls 
    of RA and the Botherhood of Power saw they were a perfect match and merged. 
    Seeing his work finally finished, Goldplate stepped down as a Core, but 
    still remained undisputedly one of the best scouts ever known.<br>
    ----------<br>
    <br>
    A note from Goldplate: I believe I put it best when I say true friendship 
    can be found in times of Darktide. As a person who loathes killing, I have 
    always supported those who fight for the side of justice. Sun Jian showed me 
    that people can be both kind and strong and many people within his ranks 
    showed faith to me in my youthful years. As a source of inspiration, I have 
    always stayed by my friend's side even when the guild had almost split to 
    pieces. Now, under the new merger, we have gained back all of our old 
    strength and more. The Angels of War will prove to be a formidable strength 
    in the Lands of Dereth.<br>

    Loot Champion)</b><br>
    <br>
    Chun-kee, an honorably dicharged soldier, nicknamed himself as such because 
    of his massive girth. In search of many friends that had dissappeared from 
    the face of Ispar, Chun-kee found and entered the purple portal leading to 
    the land of Dereth. The Sho warrior found himself in the middle of the the 
    wars of Darktide. Once again after so many years, Chun-kee hefted his katar 
    with resolve to destroy whatever evils he may face. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Chun-kee quickly found his 
    friends within the Angels of War clan, and made many more with his unique 
    talent. Years as a soldier and dogged determination taught Chun-kee how to 
    find objects of value. He often would openly share his hard gained loot to 
    people he barely knew. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Chun-kee is known for his 
    love of slamming his katar home with the weight of his bulk behind it, and 
    has openly shunned War Magic because the &quot;Feel of crushing my opponent's 
    bones is just not there.&quot; Chun-kee is also one of the few men who practices 
    the ancient art of throwing weapons. Many of even his own friends laughed at 
    him until one day during a fight with a deadly sorcerer, full VII spells and 
    fully baned. No one was able to bring the attacker down. Chun-kee skillfully 
    side-stepped a war spell as it streaked past him and hefted all his weight 
    behind a spear he had collected off of a creature named Railrea. The mage 
    was impaled with one shot to a tree, the demonic being's soul sent screaming 
    to the lifestone. Needless to say, no one laughs anymore.<br>
    ----------<br>
    <br>
    A note from Chun-kee: I LOVE this guild, so many cool people in it. Like the 
    quote says: Big Guild Power, Small Guild Feel. It's true that sometimes I 
    get carried away with my loot collecting (I have all 4 of my mules and my 
    house chest and hooks all packed full with stuff everyone else calls junk), 
    but I can always find a person in need of something. And trust me, if you 
    need it, I usually have it, or I can get it. I have made so many friends in 
    this guild and it seems like every week we are getting bigger. Maybe someday 
    we'll have enough people to get rid off this loot. Although I doubt it.

    kept him from being caught by angry farmers. It was all fun and games until

    combat and became a battle scared veteran, known for his speed and quick

    A note from Old Hollow: AoW rocks Blood behind! We might be a nice bunch of 
    fellows, but when it comes down to it, some of the best fighters in the game 
    are in our guild imho (In My Honest Opinion) [and yes it's &quot;Honest&quot; not 
    &quot;Humble&quot; DS is never humble, hehe]. But of course I'm the best. AoW's

    <br>
    It all began for me in the large town of Shoushi. I rubbed my eyes, had a 
    sip of water and looked at myself. Same clothing I had before, but in it was 
    a note inviting me into a hall. Not knowing where I was or what was there, I 
    figured maybe it would be a good idea to check this hall out. I stepped 
    inside only to see a man with a sword standing there. I said &quot;hello&quot;; he 
    replied &quot; DIE!&quot;</font></span><p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Now this was definitely a 
    different reaction than I was expecting, so I tried to defend myself best I 
    could. Surprisingly, I was able to dodge his sword swinging at me not once, 
    not twice, but thirce. After the third swing I decided to defend myself, and 
    before I knew it, the man's spirit had left him but his body remained. How 
    was I able to dodge this man? How was I able to beat him to death with my 
    hands? I decided to search for some answers and headed to the town of 
    Shoushi. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">A very very large man named 
    Mr T came up to me. I said hello expecting a reply and I suddenly felt sick 
    to my stomach and was lying on the ground. I was back at the training hall, 
    weak and confused as to what had happened. Then what happened next and has 
    happened ever since then scared me. I heard a voice of an old friend from 
    home in the back of my head. He said a simple hello. I try and speak back to 
    him and then I see 3 people rolling on the floor laughing at me as I say 
    Bluto hello.</font></span><p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the back of my head I hear 
    his voice again saying he had been saved by a very powerful woman named 
    Zatara and they lived in a town upon a plateau. If I could get there, they 
    could help me as well if I proved myself worthy. Plateau? Worthy? Worthy of 
    what? <br>
    <br>
    I later found out after getting the sickness from Mr T many more times that 
    a forest village of Glenden Wood was close to the plateau, so I set out 
    running. I ran, and ran until the sun had risen 3 times and found myself in 
    the forest town of Glenden Wood. When I arrived there, I was told to touch 
    the stone of life so that when my physical body was harmed again, I would 
    rise from there instead of the meeting hall of Mr T. I touched the stone and 
    realized the only reason these 2 men had asked me to do this was so they 
    could take the place of Mr T. I have still to this day ended up as many 
    times as those 2 poultry (ducky and goosey) had send me. I was sent there 
    over 50 times in the next 2 days but still had become more powerful than 
    when I first arrived on this strange world.<br>
    <br>
    Over the next week or so I practiced using my hand to hand skills and had 
    acquired some armor and a strange weapon that struck animals and people 
    alike with lightning. My friend Bluto was amazed I found such an item and 
    said if I could keep an item like that, I should be able to survive at the 
    plateau if I could make it there. So I suited up my armor and ran for 3 more 
    days . As I arrived I was told by the leader of my friend that they had just 
    moved to a mountain village of Stonehold and that with a magical gate I 
    could go there too. I agreed and closed my eyes and ran into the gate. This 
    was met by a laughter and some advice, &quot;In order to use the gate you must 
    reach out and touch it&quot; and with the extension of my arm I was in the 
    mountains.<br>
    <br>
    I swore my allegiance to my queen's follower Berzerk, a mage who was to help 
    me more with advice than property. The advice became handy as I was set to 
    fight the daring creatures of the pit....and to help defend town against the 
    war that was coming .....but that bit of history will come later.</font></span><p align="center">

    <br>
    Chapter 1~Dragonsblade X<br>
    <br>
    He was a young Sho lad when he first arrived on Dereth, landing in the west 
    outpost of the Holtburg settlement. Looking to escape the busy and dangerous 
    city life of Holtburg, Dragonsblade X journeyed west to the town of Glenden 
    Wood. He grew up in the beautiful country around the town. Once he started 
    hunting larger prey than his usual drudges and reedsharks, he specialized 
    and honed his skills in unarmed combat and melee defense. Once he began to 
    realize the true power he had the possibility to wield, he ventured away 
    from his home, to the far south of Dereth in hopes to find adventure and 
    friendship. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">DBX found refuge at a small 
    tower and lifestone where he pledged his loyalty to a local guild for the 
    first time. He lived the life of a non-factor anti for many, many levels, 
    until one day he began to gain friends within larger more powerful anti 
    guilds. With his anti friend Silver paladin, and co vassal Stonefox, he 
    traveled to the deadly Direlands and settled within the refuge of Fort Teth. 
    In his new, extremely dangerous surroundings, he was forced to learn how to 
    raise his skills to survive. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">A larger anti guild named 
    Alberon mindeater began to rise to power in teth, and his guild along with 
    many others aligned with this new force in an effort to hold the town from 
    invaders coming from the mainlands and southern Direlands. The Fort remained 
    under constant siege from enemy guilds such as Blood and Mid Evil. It was at 
    this point in Dragon's life that he began to realize the true power of his 
    hollow katar, and gave everything he had for the well being of the fort. <br>
    <br>
    Then there was a change. A powerful and well respected anti guild named TAO 
    began to war with the alberon mindeaters who inhabited his home. DBX, who 
    had many friends among the ranks of both guilds, decided to flee his home 
    instead of getting involved. Not knowing where to go in those perilous days, 
    he ventured along the northern shores of the mainlands. One day, he came 
    upon a lifestone along the beach, with a Stonehold portal beside it. Having 
    heard rumors of the good people of Stonehold, he decided to attune here. He 
    spent about the next year of his life attuned here, making friends and 
    defending his new home. </font></span>
    <p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Things were quit simple back 
    then, not much to do other then level and defend Stonehold from invaders and 
    raiders. His monarchy had been disbanded since he found his home in 
    Stonehold, and he swore under a local warlord named The Cursed. Things where 
    good, until one day all hell broke loose. He was restocking supplies in town 
    when a messenger alerted him to the death of Stonefox, his former co-vassal 
    and one of his truest friends. This sent dragonsblade x on a downward 
    spiral, and it was reported that he was rarely seen much after that moment. 
    After several months he began to appear around town again, and he changed 
    his lifestone to a small igloo, which gave him easier access to the town and 
    its people. It was rumored he had made a full return when the news arrived 
    that The Cursed had gone missing, And after that day Dragonsblade x just 
    faded away, and was never seen again.<br>

    It was Honey's love of purple that had drawn her to the newly formed portals 
    across the land of Ispar. Within seconds of touching the veil, Honey was 
    alone upon Dereth with nothing but her purple pajamas on. In a time of 
    Darktide, Honey quickly learned the harshness of this new land. In her youth 
    she joined a band of rebels that were often called Reckless, because of the 
    way that they defended their town without regard to the danger they faced. 
    Honey was know among her friends as a sweet. Sweet but dangerous. Honey 
    became even more dangerous when she began to master all four arts of magic. 
    Naturally, it didn't sound good to call her Honey, sweet but even more 
    dangerous. So because of her habit of daydreaming, her friends called her 
    Phantasia the Pheared instead.</font></span><p align="left">
    <span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">But there is not much to fear 
    of this mage, for she kind, and caring, and often tries to think of the 
    other person first, even when it has caused her to take most of the burden. 
    There is not much to fear, unless she gets angry, that is. In combat 
    Phantsia is a fierce fireball of purple magic. Following Deathsun in his 
    search to form the most powerful guild of justice to roam the land, 
    Phantasia left her home in Stonehold to join forces with the clan of Sun 
    Jian. There she made many friends but longed for the ones she had left 
    behind on Ispar and Stonehold. After the death of Sun Jian, Phantsia and 
    another (whose name is sadly forgotten to the winds of time) became the 
    Co-Leaders of the Ronin guild. With morale at its lowest point, Phantasia 
    took on much of the clans emotional burden to try to keep everyone from 
    going their separate ways. Presently, things are looking much better. With 
    the merger of clans in Stonehold, all of Phantsia's friends have united 
    under a single cause. What's more, an old friend, Chunk-kee, came from Ispar 
    with news that everyone is well back home. Home... Someday, Phantasia 
    thought to herself, someday we will all go home.<br>

    A note from Phantasia: AoW is like a homecoming for me for many reasons. 
    Mostly because it was a reuniting with old friends who taught me how to 
    fight and survive in the world of Dereth when I was just a wee sprout. Now 
    we have grown to be more than just friends... we are indeed a family. </font></span></td>
