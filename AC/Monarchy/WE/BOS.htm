    <b><font face="Arial" size="2">Bio of Dieter McBain<br>
	</font></b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
	A story told by the Gods is usually heard by only those of either kingly 
	heritage or upon their awaiting the arrival of Crom. My story is a story 
	akin to this. I am Dieter McBain, of the clan McBain. My father was William 
	Marcus McBain and his lineage dates back to the times of the Ahacine Wars. 
	My mother was Frieda Teufal. Her family descended from the Northlands where 
	their language is forgotten, yet the deeds of their ancestors shall never 
	be. <br>
	I was born into a time of war. I have had to learn much thru self sacrifice 
	and thru my own mistakes. I learned the art of sword fighting from a slave 
	my father owned. Upon my father's murder, I freed my teacher only to witness 
	his murder at the hands of a Shadow Lieutenant. I then learned the Black 
	Arts of Magic from another friend. I have become a master of Life, Item, and 
	Creature. I am now learning the art of Mana Conversion, knowing this will 
	take time and I will endeavor to master it as well. <br>
	<br>
	My story thru the ages has included bloodbaths and many lonely nights upon 
	the plains of Dereth. In my travels I have begun to collect a lost rag tag 
	band of followers. These Melee's, Mages, and Archers have become friends 
	that I owe much too. I am thankful for their loyalty. <br>
	I have accepted my place at the head of this group. My responsibilities run 
	great and I know I shall not fail. My parents taught me that a friend comes 
	when called, a friend answers the alarms of war, and a friend must be loyal 
	above all. I understand and live by these principals. I will be fair and 
	just. I shall be honorable and loyal. I shall be firm and steadfast in my 
	beliefs. I shall honor the names of those lost in battle. I shall forget the 
	names of the weak along with those who cannot stand in battle and flee when 
	one needs their help most. <br>
	<br>
	My friends shall live by my side and die by my side. I shall never forget 
	them as long as they are loyal to my cause. I shall bring together this band 
	of rag tags, this brotherhood of lost souls, this Brotherhood of Steel! Let 
	all know that my loyalty is Forever and For All Eternity!<br>
	<br>
	~~Dieter McBain (Sword/Item/Critter/Life)~~<br>
