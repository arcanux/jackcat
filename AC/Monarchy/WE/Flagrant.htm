    <br>
    A close knit guild of friends structured without politics or strife for our<br>
    own benefit.<br>
    <br>
    We're a group of friends. I, Hilunder, serve as the figurehead Monarch 
    purely for purposes of recognizing how we're all sworn together. We make all 
    decisions as a group. When interacting with other guilds, no FLOD member 
    speaks for us without knowing from previous discussion what our position is, 
    or they wait until we discuss the issue before acting. Every FLOD member has 
    a say in what we do and how we do it. The only rule set forth and ratified 
    unanimously is that no FLOD member will engage in any public display of 
    negativity towards any other guild, be it on the boards or be it in open 
    chat in game.<br>
    <br>
    Membership requirements: Is this someone I would hunt with? Would I be 
    willing to visit the lifestone on more then one occasion for this person? 
    Can I see myself spending time with this person? And will they see me the 
    same way? Would I drop what I was doing to help them with a problem? Would 
    they for me? Can I trust them? Can I mule around them? Can I give this 
    prospective member a body permit? Are they here just for the free buffbot?<br>
    Weapons? Tools? I'm not. They shouldn't be. <i>~By St Evan of the FLOD.</i><br>
    <br>
    We have several xp style minichains set up to push our tinkerers. We have no 
    formal ban or allowances for xp chains.<br>
    <br>
    We're a small group, we quest a lot with ally and friendly guilds, and go 
    hunting regularly.</font></span></p>

    <b>Hilunder<br>
    </b>Hilunder is the FLOD Monarch. His operational duties entail: Holding the 
    Mansion, Administering the Forum Boards. That's it. Hilunder is proud to be 
    called one of the Family known as the FLOD, and I consider myself equal to 
    each and every FLOD member. All my IG toons belong to this family and we 
    have together built a tight knit group that is willing to kiss the ls for 
    each other any time, any where.<br>

    up of Archers, mages, melee and a cook/alchy As with all members of The FLOD

    <b>Lumia<br>
    </b>Lumia is an archer that has been with the FLOD family almost since the 
    beginning. She goes back a ways with most of the elder FLOD member so they 
    forgive her for being a little cocky. As with all members she will jump in 
    and help where ever she can, even if it means visiting the LS a few times.</font></span><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"><br>
