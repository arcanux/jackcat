        Hi there, Maggie. I just got done reading
        <a target="_blank" href="http://ac.turbinegames.com/index.php?page_id=347">
        Jessica Mulligan's letter</a> about the expansion pack and the schedule 
        for retail release. <br>
        <br>
        I understand that Turbine will need to forgo the regular patches for the 
        months of March and April. The expansion will be released in May 
        (Jessica said)<span lang="en-us">,</span> and then she plans to return to regular monthly updates 
        starting in June.<br>
        <br>
        Here's what I propose: Let's allow Turbine a one extra month of 
        catch-your-breath time! They will have done a lot of hard work. We've 
        had 52 continuous months of updates, (as Jessica was careful to point 
        out) and, what the hell. <br>
        <br>
        We can start regular monthly patches again in July. <br>
        <br>
        And, er, maybe you could mention to Ms. Mulligan that a small gift, 
        placed in my backpack after the expansion, would not be unappreciated. 
        ;) <br>

        That sounds reasonable enough to me. Although a lot of people are crying 
        and moaning about a few missed patches, I can't complain! It will 
        finally give me a chance to catch up on all the quests I haven't done! 
        Patches always suck up my limited play time because I'm so busy updating 
        the site, so this will be a nice break.</span></font></p>

        Hey Maggie!<br>
        Atamagaokashii of TD here. I just thought I'd give ya probably the best 
        thing that has happened to <span lang="en-us">me</span> and my brother, 
        Berdock, inside AC. About 4 years ago -<span lang="en-us">-</span> Fall 2001 
        <span lang="en-us">-</span>- Berdock and I joined 
        the game. We were part of a small clan known as the Thunder Dragons, and 
        once housing was introduced, we actively camped out a whole Settlement, 
        later named Meerthus Square <span lang="en-us">-</span>- near Cragstone
        <span lang="en-us">-</span>- and most of us got our houses. The Butte 
        Rangers<span lang="en-us"> -- </span>a group of us that lived within 20 
        minutes or so of each other -<span lang="en-us">-</span> Falkon, Terra 
        the Rose (my patron at the time) and Pinetree, all people Berdock and I 
        know in real life - and Berdock and I all a<span lang="en-us">c</span>quired 
        houses.<br>
        <br>
        For about a year we all quested together, met together, and partied 
        together in that settlement. Then Berdock and I left AC while everyone 
        moved over to AC2 and Star Wars Galaxies. Just 6 months ago, Berdock and 
        I rejoined, and were delighted to find our original characters still 
        there, waiting for us to return, but our cottage was not, and neither 
        were our friends of old. Just yesterday <span lang="en-us">-</span>- 
        2-17-05 -<span lang="en-us">-</span> we journeyed back to Meerthus 
        Square to pay remembrance to our friends. To our surprise and delight, 
        our cottage of old was vacant! And in an even bigger surprise, it had 
        hooked above its door an Aegis that could be wielded by one person
        <span lang="en-us">-</span>- me! We rushed about for awhile scrambling 
        to vacate our replacement cottage in the Al-Arquis Settlement of Al-Jalima, 
        and bought our cottage back :)<br>
        <br>
        I apologize for the length of this story, but I thought you would like 
        to hear it, especially since you're on the same server and all.<span lang="en-us">

        <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Atamagaokashii -<br>
        That's a very cool story. I can't believe your Aegis was still over the 
        door! It's fate! I had housing luck myself a few weeks ago. My mule 
        account has been living in an apartment for years. But finally, for the 
        first time since I can remember, a house opened up in my settlement. My 
        mules now live just two doors down! It's great having all my peeps 
        together in one place.</span></font></p>

        <span lang="en-us">- A Tribute to the Devs</span></b></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">First, let me just explain a little about myself. 
        My name is David and I have been playing Asheron's Call off and on since 
        1999. Since then, I have seen a lot of the developers come and go and 
        plenty of them hang around. Not to mention I have played at least thirty 
        different characters and gone through roughly six accounts. My current 
        main is Sheik Yabuda of Morningthaw.<br>
        <br>
        A lot of the times when I think about AC, these people's names come up:<br>
        <br>
        Allan Maki<br>
        Chris L'etoile<br>

        Ken Troop<br>
        Les Nelken<br>
        Nik Davidson<br>
        Sean Huxter<br>
        <br>
        I would like to dedicate this short-film to them as thanks for all the 
        great work they have done. This is my first actual short-film of any 
        kind, so bear with me, as it is a little rough. Sadly, the process of 
        making it took three attempts. About two hours into my first attempt of 
        stringing together .avi's, they were deleted. After that, I had to go 
        back and re-tape all the scenes I had before. After doing this, I 
        started stringing the .avi's together again. Eventually I had something 
        that looked half-way decent. It was certainly not what I had before, but 
        it would do. So I made of some title scenes, cropped some music files 
        and added credits. I was done.<br>
        <br>
        ..or so I thought. It turned out I made a few typos that really should 
        not be in there. Since I didn't save my WIP, I had to go back and re-do 
        the music section of the film and edit out the typos. The final product 
        is a little bit better than my first attempt, but I suppose it lost a 
        little flavor. Anyways, enjoy (...hopefully).<br>
        <br>
        Thanks again to Maggie for hosting the film and to pointing out some of 
        the typos. *shake fist*<br>

        Hi Sheik Yabuda -<br>
        I'm happy to host the video. I enjoyed watching it! Nothing can compare 
        to those early days in AC, that's for sure. And I know the more 
        behind-the-scenes devs are included in your sentiments. Although I often 
        peer back on the past through my rose colored nostalgia glasses, I've 
        loved watching AC evolve and grow. I think the game is, dare I say it, 
        the best it's ever been. The newer devs have had some big shoes to fill, 
        but I think they've been up to the task. I've personally developed a 
        fan-crush on the creator of the recent Niffis quest, whomever it was. It 
        was just so twisted and cute! With a very traditional AC flavor.</span></font></p>
        <p>
        <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">If I have any complaints about 
        the previous devs, well, they should have documented their code better! 
        But what can you expect from a buncha guys working out of Mom's 
        basement. ;-) </font></span></p>
