    </strong><em><small>by Maggie the Jackcat</small></em></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Well, I didn't sleep; that's for sure! My flight
    left at 7:15AM on Friday and I lived an hour from the airport. With wrapping things up at
    work, laundry, packing, etc. the day began to get later and later Thursday evening. Then
    of course I needed to log into the game to give my vassal some stuff before I headed out
    of town. I was pleasantly surprised to see some of my buddies online so I stayed in the
    game for a bit, chatting and hanging out and killing stuff. Then I died. I didn't really
    want to leave town with Maggie the Jackcat having all that nasty vitae hanging on her.
    (Sort of like making your bed and changing the sheets before leaving town, so you can home
    to a nicely made bed.) So, I decided I might as well just stay up and play the game for a
    bit more. After all, I was on vacation, wasn't I?! Well, I am sure most of you know how
    that goes. :)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>After staying up all night, I snagged a window
    seat on the plane so I could sleep through to Boston. Dave Namerow and Chris Clay, two of
    Turbine's finest, were waiting for us at the airport (Allen Grey and his wife and the
    newlyweds, Azeraphel and Queen Froggi, were on the same flight). Once Cassie joined us, we
    headed for the hotel. I had met Allen and Az and Cassie at the player gathering in
    Minnesota in February and was looking forward to meeting the rest of the CoD staff in
    person. Since we had a few hours before the Turbine Tour, we grabbed the rest of the crew
    who were already at the hotel and had a chance to hang out and get to know each other a
    bit. I also got to meet Penelope who has the coolest job title of anyone I have ever met:
    Technology Infrastructure Diva.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>The Turbine Tour was truly a treat! We got to
    preview the video they had put together for the Player Luncheon. They had also prepared
    for our visit by doctoring all their white boards with humorous lists of their upcoming
    nerfs. One board, designed as a target, had random nerfs and other alarming game
    suggestions scattered across it, with a dart placed firmly in the &quot;Nerf Quix&quot;
    spot. To the right was a list of players Turbine was &quot;out to get.&quot; I could
    clearly make out Allen Grey's name among them.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>It's true that the Turbine workplace has some
    kick-ass culture. I once worked in a job where I was reprimanded (formally reprimanded --
    in WRITING) for not wearing my shoes behind a desk in a room that noone ever came in but
    me, so I was envious of all the toys and casual, fun atmosphere. Everyone was pretending
    to work, but when we got a closer look at their monitors, we could see they were all
    really playing Diablo II. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Just kidding, of course! They were very gracious
    about letting us watch the magic in action. Rebecca (Froggi) and I made what I know were
    very helpful suggestions for some of the future goodies Turbine has in store. I could tell
    you what they were, but then I'd have to kill you. (We all signed NDAs :) We also watched
    Patricia playing in-game for a while. She let us know she would hunt us down and kill us
    if we revealed her game name to anyone. Just think! You could be playing alongside a
    Turbinite at any time and not know it!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>After the tour, we all went out to dinner at a
    nearby steak house. The electricity going out didn't diminish in the slightest the
    enjoyment we were having. At my end of the table were Cassie, Dave Namerow, Sean Huxter,
    Soulitaire, Uriel, Margo, Az and Froggi. I'm sure I'm leaving some people out. There were
    lots of other people with the group that I didn't have the slightest idea who they were,
    but that's ok! It was a lot of fun! A totally delightful crowd!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>After dinner a group of us invaded Dunkin'
    Donuts for some coffee. Caeryn Dryad and I got to grill a very accommodating Dave Namerow
    with question after question about the game. He also hit us with AC trivia questions, one
    after the other. This really was one of the highlights of the trip for me. It's not every
    day that you can hang out with people who share the same weirdly obsessive affection for a
    favorite pastime. And one of them actually knew stuff!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I ended the evening by hanging out with Cassie
    talking until way too late, and was horrified to learn that Allen had requested the CoD
    staff to be down to meet over breakfast at 8AM. I insisted he didn't mean me; he mean Az
    and her and people like that. She said, &quot;see you at 8.&quot; </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>The Player Luncheon itself was loads of fun.
    Allen gave us an hour or so before getting starting to mingle and meet.&nbsp; Quix and I
    exchanged name tags for a while, but we changed back when I told him about some of the fan
    email I got because of my site (&quot;You're beautiful; I love you.&quot; Hee hee.) I got
    to meet lots of people whom I had talked to in-game or by email, like Dragon Warrior and
    Maddy and Auz from Stratics, and just a ton of others who I am probably insulting right
    now by neglecting to mention them by name. Every single person, Turbinite or fan, I
    had the pleasure of meeting was extraordinarily nice. Really, a fine crew.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Many of you may have heard about the itinerary
    of the Gathering, but I will still repeat some of highlights. Jason Booth gave a great
    talk -- inspiring, comical and at times touching -- about Turbine's early days, when they
    lived from demo to demo, surviving on cereal in one of their mother's homes. We saw a
    video, narrated by Justin of the Weenie Team, of a humorous guided tour of the Turbine
    offices. We had a live dev chat where it was revealed that thrown weapons had some love in
    their future. We saw another video, this time of the Turbine blooper reel -- an absolutely
    hilarious compilation of clips that *didn't* make it into the demos. And (drumroll) we got
    to see a preview of the new graphics engine: WorldBuilder 2.0. My words can't begin to do
    justice to this amazing artistry. After the video was played, we were asked if we wanted
    to see it again. The walls shook, the response of &quot;Yes!&quot; was so loud and
    enthusiastic. I bet if we had been asked 15 times in a row if we wanted to watch it again
    the answer would have been the same, it was that amazing! (I kid you not.) </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">And of course, we got to watch various attendees
    make total fools of themselves during the &quot;Whose Drudge is it Anyway&quot;
    competition. Somehow, signing up for the event just slipped right by me; I had fully
    intended to participate, I had had so much fun with it during the February Minnesota
    Gathering. And absolutely nothing could have been worse than the topic we (as the first
    team ever to play!) were given: Banderling Foot Rot. Alas, I missed my chance to shine. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">However, I did have one moment of glory. I
    bumped into Stormwaltz in the buffet line and greeting him with &quot;It's a famous
    person!&quot; He responded back, &quot;It's another famous person!&quot; I felt like
    pretty hot stuff, let me tell you. :) On the other hand, I was completely astonished to
    find that most of the Turbine staff had absolutely no idea about the existence of my
    charming little web site. I certainly remedied that, and insisted that they stop by and
    browse some day, and wallow in the homage I give to their delightful crockery and random
    loot generators. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">All good things must come to an end. Or do
    they?! We dragged the Luncheon through to dinner as various groups of fans and Turbinites
    invaded area restaurants. I had the pleasure of dining with Dave &quot;Crowley&quot; and
    Salmoneus and Wynder and a buncha other people. And I even briefly sat next to Chris
    Foster who said, (again, I kid you not!) &quot;It's in the game, but not in the
    game,&quot; in response to a question Quix and I threw his way. Then... we went to see
    X-Men!! Really, was this a perfect day, or what?! As I expounded to Wynder and Quix in the
    car on the way back to the hotel about some of the great story lines in the comic books
    (of which I have a substantial collection), Quix turned to me and said, &quot;Are you sure
    you're a girl?&quot; Haha. That made me laugh. Then Wynder fired his own zinger when we
    realized that I had completely missed Kitty Pryde's cameo in the earlier part of the
    movie. He shot me a withering, &quot;And you call yourself a fan.&quot; (P.S. Thanks,
    Quix, for hauling us around all day!)</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">But wait! It's not over yet! Many, many of us
    ended up at an Irish Pub. I hitched a ride there with Sturm Strongheart, Ravlen and Cassie
    and had more great car conversation. I sat across from one fellow 1/2 the evening before
    realizing he was Merry from Split Pea (another famous person!). We talked Darktide. (I
    have an unsatisfied yen to try Darktide.) We all continued our harmonious AC love fest
    until we were finally tossed out. Many people congregated in the lobby back at the hotel
    and I somehow found myself discussing the finer points of composite bow making with Wylie,
    Froggi and Ravlen until, um, 3AM. Which was dreadful, since the airport shuttle was
    arriving for me at 5:20AM. Did I mention I didn't sleep much?</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">There is even more to this story, believe it or
    not. (Geez, does she *ever* shut up?!) From Boston I flew South, the land of big hair and
    kudzu, to visit my sister and brother-in-law. Waiting for me was the new kick-ass computer
    system my brother-in-law had been building for me. During Jason's talk he had mentioned
    how small the Beta 0 team had been. I was *in* Beta 0. (Bring back the fart emote!!) I
    never quite figured out how I made it in. I actually had to be rescued from the Tutorial
    Dungeon in early beta! I personally like to think I'm responsible for the big green arrows
    that now guide the way. :) I thought it might have been because I was female and they
    didn't have many sign up. But I have since decided that it was probably because I had the
    crappiest computer system of anyone who had signed up, and the crappiest computer system
    of anyone currently playing the game, with the exception of Sean Huxter.&nbsp; Not
    anymore! For the first time, I left software mode behind, as I played AC with my new
    GeForce2, on a *fast* computer and a zippy connection. Whoo-hoo!!! It was very nice. My
    sister and her husband were so impressed that they both got copies of the game and will be
    joining us all in Dereth. </font></small></p>
