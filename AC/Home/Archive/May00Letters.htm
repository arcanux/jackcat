    Hoary Mattekar</small><br>
    <br>
    </strong><font size="2">Greetings Maggie! <br>
    I am Morheru, a 24th level warrior on Frostfell. I saw your letter about snowmen possibly
    returning and hence, the possible return of the infamous Hoary Mattekar. If it does
    return, I can quickly say that I will be one of the first to start camping for the whole
    time it's back. But, an interesting little tid-bit reached my ear recently, concerning the
    location of this wondrous beast -- implying that it <u>CAN STILL BE FOUND! </u>I haven't
    look into this yet, but perhaps you can help shed some light on the subject.</font></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mount Esper.....during a snow storm.....after forty kills of a
    certain creature....a Hoary is rumored to spawn.....only once....every forty

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>I think it sounds like a great rumor, but
    just that: a rumor. Really, you've seen how long something stays a secret in AC -- about 2
    minutes! If there really was a spawning hoary mattekar, that spot would be so camped the
    world would begin to tip from the weight in that corner! But, it's a nice rumor. I might
    post your letter and help spread it! Ha.</small></font></p>

    <strong><small><font face="Arial">May 10, 2000 - My Vassal Still Wants a Matty Coat</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Hey, Maggie -- <br>
    <br>
    I was just reading the MAY 1 letters in your letters section. Fine reader contributions
    and excellent answers, as usual.<br>
    <br>
    In one of your responses you mention that your vassal (that's me!) is level 33. I am
    actually level 34, and will become level 35 in less than 200k -- about 2 days from now.
    And when I am level 35, I will be able to train ITEM!<br>
    <br>
    That's point one. Point 2 is that my loyalty skill is now 100, up from 99. I notice that
    it is no longer posted on the site. I am bereaved and disconsolate. Or, as Hercule Poirot
    (Agatha Christies famous mystery slueth, and my favorite character in literature) would
    say, &quot;I am desolated.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    A final detail: A Mattekar Coat for me. Any news or further developments regarding a
    Mattie Coat for me? I noticed -- again, reading your responses to May 1 letters -- that
    &quot;My level 33 vassal doesn't even have a matty coat!&quot; Is this an indication that
    my lack of a Mattie coat has become an accepted situation? Is it now just part of life?
    Should I let go of the notion and move on? Am I answering my own question? Haha, ok!</font></small></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Hello, Best of Vassals --</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>What a pleasure it was to see your name pop
    up in a Letter to Maggie! I will try to address your questions and concerns.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>1) The letter stating you were level 33 was
    an older letter that I am just now getting up. I will make the necessary adjustments!
    Since I know you have now made Level 35 (Congratulations!! You will love having Item!), I
    will change the front page and remark that you are now FOURTEEN levels above me. But not
    for long. I am just inches away from leveling myself!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>2) You loyalty level is on the What's New
    page, although I can move it to the Front page if you think that's better. I adjusted the
    number to 100 the other day. May I add that it was *several* days ago that I adjusted the
    total to 100. I've heard rumors that <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Danier.htm">Danier's</a>
    loyalty stat is 147!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>3) I am going to have to BUY you a Matty Coat
    on eBay. It seems to be the only way! I've hinted and begged, but fame does have its
    limits! And noone is more deserving than you. I am ashamed of my terrible Patron skills!
    Must be that 34 Leadership stat; it's the only explanation.</small></font></p>

    like that sort of thing! :) Now about the abbreviation for Impious. Well... you're wrong!
    Believe me, I was as shocked as you were to find that I've been mispronouncing it all
    these years.&nbsp; I was certain (absolutely certain) that Im-pie-us was an alternative
    pronunciation. But, it's not. I checked my Webster's unabridged (the big enormous fat
    one), and then checked the mother of all dictionaries, the OED (Oxford English
    Dictionary). Im-pie-ous was not listed as an alternative. Is that amazing, or what?! I am
    very much a word person, so it was a blow to me, for sure. I am delicate!</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>This was a popular question in the recent
    email I've received, so I thought this would be good mail to get up in the Letters
    section. The nexus gem was a one time only quest during the Thorns of the Hopeslayer
    event. The random portals which kept appearing throughtout Dereth opened into the spires.
    Once inside, people faced the Shadow Captains and were rewarded with pieces of keys. <br>
    <br>
    There were two keys needed, three parts each, that had to be put together to get into the
    locked doors of the Nexus. Once there, the heroes vanquished the Nexus Crystal and were
    rewarded with 4 Scintillating Gems and a Nexus Core Crystal. This Core Crystal could then
    be made into the Ultimate Shadow Armor. Sorry, only one set per server. I'm still not sure
    if the keys to get into the Nexus are still available, sort of like Frore after the Great
    Work was destroyed, but I'll be hoping to clarify this in the near future. I hope that
    answers your questions. The Stats for the Nexus Armor are listed on my <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow Armor</a> page.</small></font></p>
