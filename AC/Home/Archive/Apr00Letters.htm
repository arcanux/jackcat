    You can no longer get a new Mattekar Robe in-game. The Great Hoary Mattekar was hunted to
    extinction during the Sudden Season!! There's a finite supply and they are very rare. The

    <p><small><strong><font face="Arial">April 21, 2000 - Does the Frore Axe Exist?</font></strong></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Ok, I've been drooling over this axe, ever since I read about
    it on your site over a month ago. Yes, the axe skill is 394, I still want this axe
    though...<br>
    <br>
    Now I'm very confused about the status of this axe. At first from reading your page, it
    stated that only the Tremblant's Ivory Staff was no longer in the game. I would then read
    about adventurers who had recently visited the lost city and would tell tales about the
    items they found there... always mentioning how the staff was no longer there and how they
    got each of the other items... never once mentioning the axe though. This left me
    wondering what is going on? I then came across a letter on your site, about someone
    mentioned how they were going to go after the axe... but that is about as much information
    there was.<br>
    <br>
    After asking the question myself on an AC forum about whether or the axe was still
    available, I received responses saying it was no longer in the game. Others say that the
    first person to have completed the quest was the only one to receive it. And now your site
    not only states that the axe is no longer available, but possibly never existed?!? Ahh!!!
    :) This is very un-nerving; which is it? Where did you get the stats and icon if the axe
    never existed? Thank you for taking time to read my ramblings<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Well, I got the stats and icon from a
    screenshot someone sent me. I have never seen the axe myself. As you know, screenshots can
    be faked and players do occasionally play hoaxes. One of the staff at CoD&nbsp;told me
    that the axe never existed, which is why I changed my site to read &quot;if it ever
    existed it all.&quot; I've since seen shots of this axe on two other fan sites. The bottom
    line is that I have no idea if it's real or not. Sorry for the confusion. In any case, it
    is definitely no longer there. That has been verified by Draax.</small></font></p>

    vita, <em>of life</em>.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>If you *really* want to get picky, in
    classical Latin &quot;v&quot; is pronounced as a &quot;w&quot;, so it should really be wee
    tai. But since Derethians don't really speak Latin and it's just some gamers with faulty
    memories of their high school Latin classes making stuff up, we can pronounce it any way
    we want! I'm just passing on what I hear is Turbine's pronunciation. But I appreciate the
    note! It's important to pay attention to the details.</small></font></p>

    <p><strong><font face="Arial"><small>April 13, 2000 - My Vassal: The Mana Junkie</small><br>
    </font></strong><br>
    <small><font face="Arial">Maggie &#150;- Here is an insane criticism for you. Makes me
    wonder what&#146;s wrong with me. Why do I have time or energy to focus on something like
    this and actually write MAIL about it. I think I need a vacation. Maybe I just need to
    concentrate more on playing AC!<br>
    <br>
    In the &#147;Send Mail to Maggie&#148; form, there are two checkboxes that say &#147;You
    may publish my mail.&#148; And &#147;Please do not publish my mail.&#148; Now, here is my
    criticism: shouldn&#146;t they be radio buttons, instead of check boxes? I seem to be able
    to check them BOTH. <br>
    <br>
    Here is *another* criticism: your mail instructions say you will use the first part of an
    email address if no in-game name and server is provided. You use the example of <a href="mailto:URDEAD@playerkiller.com">URDEAD@playerkiller.com</a>, saying that it becomes
    truncated to URDEAD. <br>
    <br>
    But your FORM does not ALLOW a person to not provide a game name. How about that, huh?
    That is a contradiction, right? Of course it is. Ok. I think I need to go play for a
    while. <br>
    <br>
    I am chronically short of mana stones. I have not purchased a friggin' trade note in many
    days. I have no money, it all goes to mana stones to support my magic armor and jewelry. I

    <p><font face="Arial"><small><strong>April 9, 2000 - Does This Girth Make My Butt Look
    Big?</strong></small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Dear Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    First and foremost; *LARGE* kudos on your excellent web site!&nbsp; It&#146;s a
    wonderfully refreshing blend of humor and insight and I hope it&#146;s as much fun for you
    to publish as it is for the rest of us to use!<br>
    <br>
    Now, as to the purpose of my letter:&nbsp; As someone who&#146;s obviously gotten
    &#146;Stylish in Dereth&#146; down to a science, I&#146;ve got two questions for ya, girl.<br>
    <br>
    First:&nbsp; For the last few weeks I&#146;ve been obsessing over collecting enough
    Crystal Shards and Dark Specks to get myself some of that new Shadow Armor.&nbsp; I&#146;m
    almost there . . . two specks short . . . and I figured it was time to do a little
    shopping.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, a girl needs to make clothing decisions with due
    deliberation. (&#147;Does this girth make my butt look big?&nbsp; Be honest.&#148;) &nbsp;
    It was a case of perfect timing when I found your&nbsp; *highly informative* section on
    the very topic that currently interested me; Shadow Armor.<br>
    <br>
    I already knew there were three different types of armor, one for each of the heritage
    groups.&nbsp; I&#146;d *thought* the decision as to which type I was going to get was kind
    of a no-brainer.&nbsp; A Sho-girl like me needs to be true to her roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I
    smiled and nodded at the listings for Celedon and Amuli.&nbsp; Nice stats.&nbsp; Fairly
    attractive.&nbsp; Big deal.&nbsp; Then I turned to the Koujia (am I spelling that right?)
    entry.<br>
    <br>
    I stuck my eyeballs back into my head and looked again.<br>
    <br>
    AL:85??!!<br>
    <br>
    That&#146;s a misprint . . . right?&nbsp; Right???<br>
    <br>
    Are you telling me I busted my hump, risked my life and generally wasted two weeks of my
    free time to scrimp and save for something *decidedly inferior* to something I could just
    head down to Cateril Carsmid&#146;s and buy?!&nbsp; (I&#146;m talking plate armor here.)<br>
    <br>
    Where does one go to complain?&nbsp; Who do I whine to, to get this changed?<br>
    <br>
    Okay . . . enough bitching.&nbsp; Second question.<br>
    <br>
    I lied in the first point.&nbsp; The Shadow Armor is actually going to go to my
    sword-swinging-maniac of a brother.&nbsp; Let&#146;s face it, ol&#146; &#145;Kill It Till
    It&#146;s Dead, Then Kill It Some More&#146; needs good armor far more than I do. &nbsp;
    (Not that I&#146;m saying that Koujia Krap is &#145;good armor&#146; mind you. &nbsp; Okay
    . . . enough bitching.)&nbsp; Anyway, that still leaves me looking for armor to hide
    behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obunaga (my brother) has promised me his Matty coat as soon as he
    finds something better.&nbsp; (I&#146;ve been bugging him either to get me one of those of
    my own or to engage in a little hand-me-down with his loving, devoted sister. &nbsp;&nbsp;
    *big, waif-ish eyes*&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey!&nbsp; An *armored* real-fur coat? &nbsp; What girl
    doesn&#146;t want one of those?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even when I do get my fur coat,
    that&#146;s still going to leave me with these crummy reed shark hide pants.<br>
    <br>
    Let&#146;s face it; tight leather pants make a statement.&nbsp; And it&#146;s not one
    I&#146;m sure I want to be making.<br>
    <br>
    Besides . . . they chafe!<br>
    <br>
    Which brings me to my second question;&nbsp; I&#146;ve seen some really stylin&#146; armor
    on some of the folks lately.&nbsp; I&#146;m talking the custom-color Celedon and the like,
    not the bargain-bin gold chain that every shop seems to have by the truckload.&nbsp;
    I&#146;m assuming that those yummy togs are found as treasure, but to date I&#146;ve never
    found any.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where does one go to hunt for such items?<br>
    <br>
    Or, to put it another way; who does a girl have to kill in order to get some nice clothes?<br>
    <br>
    Again, thanks for your *wonderful* site.&nbsp; I&#146;ll be looking forward to future
    updates.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Hi Nandesu Ka!</small><br>
    <small>The Letters Section is fast becoming one of my favorite parts of the site. Not only
    because I get to hear people saying all kinds of nice things about me (although that's
    something I really like a whole lot!), but also because of letters like yours. What
    thoroughly entertaining mail! I get some of the best letters! Now, to address your
    questions:</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>1) Shadow Armor comes in three different
    strengths, depending on how soon you redeem your gem. If you wait, and combine more specks
    and shards, you can make a higher quality gem. The *Greater* Koujia Shadow Armor, made
    from a Scintillating Gem, has an AL of 195 -- not too shabby. I think you were looking at
    the first table, the lower quality armor, made from the Glimmering Gem</small>. <small>Scroll
    down the page for the different varieties.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>2) To recap (because I liked this line so
    much): &quot;Who does a girl have to kill in order to get some nice clothes?&quot;</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Maggie the Jackcat is still a pretty weenie fighter, so I only have this through
    word of mouth: Kill the Olthoi, of course! More specifically, I've heard Olthoi Nobles,
    occasional chests and floor spawns in high level dungeons, Gigas Lugians, high level
    Tuskers, Liches and Tumeroks. Happy hunting!</small></font></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial">I just wanted to take the time to write so nobody else will
    have happen to them what happened to me.&nbsp; After two months of collecting pyreal
    motes, I get ready to have them changed by an alchemist, only he steals both pyreal bars
    and exits the game.&nbsp; I dont know how I could have stopped this, or even if there is a
    way.&nbsp; I almost tore the game up and threw it away.&nbsp; The designers need to come
    up with a way that theft can be punished.&nbsp; If I could have hired a Player Killer to
    hunt him down and kill him, he would be dead, and he would know there is a penalty for
    theft.&nbsp; However, as the game stands now, honesty is in no way enforceable.&nbsp; For
    a quest requirement where you have to have an alchemist, you're screwed.&nbsp; I believe
    that there should be a NPC alchemist, whether he be in a dungeon or not. It is time to do
    something about theft. This has just spoiled the game for me and I am not really
    interested in continuing to play because of it. </font></small><br>

    <br>
    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Dear Rhuarc -<br>
    Wow. That really sucks. Really, really sucks. I've heard lamers like this say it's fine to
    take stuff because the game allows it -- in other words, there's no such thing as theft in
    AC. You handed it to him and he's just role-playing a thief; I say they're role-playing an
    a**hole. I can see these folks' position in cases of muling. If people are stupid enough
    to drop items on the ground in a crowded area, they deserve to lose them. (Not that I
    agree with this position, but it's a fair argument.) In general, I like the idea of having
    to trust other players, just like in &quot;real life.&quot; But in this case, where you
    pretty much have to hand off your hard-earned loot to finish the quest -- after all, how
    many melee fighters have a high alchemy skill? -- it's just completely, totally rotten and
    mean. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>I dub this Shadow Bait &quot;Scumbag of the
    Year.&quot; I wish I had a pile of motes to give to you, along with a list of &nbsp;
    trustworthy alchemists on Frostfell. I absolutely understand wanting to quit over
    something like this. When you invest so much time into something, it's frustrating when
    some loser can just take it away. It's one of the reasons I stopped playing another online
    game a while ago. I would just get too angry, and the game stopped being fun. I hope you
    decide not to quit. Overall, Turbine has done a remarkable job keeping the a**hole factor
    out and the fun factor in. </small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hiya yet again! &nbsp; You're so good at answering, I thought
    I'd torment you again!&nbsp; However; I am not tormenting you out of sheer laziness.&nbsp;
    I've looked for this info on AC Vault, AC Stratics, Crossroads, Asheron's Lore and a
    plethora of misc sites and have yet to find the answer.</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Dilemna: My hubby, as a newbie, pledged allegiance to someone who made a poor patron for
    his class.&nbsp; He broke off the alliance about 3 levels ago.&nbsp; We conned (hehe) my
    patron into taking him in.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when he tried to pledge to him, he got a
    message stating that he didn't have enough experience to pledge (or something to that
    effect).&nbsp; He swears he had 1K experience to go immediately after breaking with the
    first patron and now it says he needs 4K more to go. Humm...</small><br>
    <small><br>
    I posted it to a board in similar wording and got some responses that attempted to
    explain, but I'm still really lost. So...do you know anything about experience penalties
    and how they work?&nbsp; Is he doomed or merely bugged?</small></font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><strong><br>
    </strong><small>Your tormenting but devoted fan,<br>
    Jaide of the Quasi-Matching Hunter Green</small></font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><br>
    <font color="#FFFF80"><small>Hi Jaide!<br>
    I will see if I can answer this for you. Yes, when a vassal breaks from a patron, there is
    a penalty for him to pledge to a new patron. He has to suffer somehow for breaking his
    oath of loyalty! Your husband's penalty started as 1K experience points. But the longer he
    goes without reswearing, the more the penalty will increase. Your husband was unable to
    swear to a new patron because he does not have&nbsp;enough <em><strong>unused experience
    points </strong></em>to pay the penalty. </small></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>When you fight stuff, kill things, you gain
    exp points. Some are applied directly to the skills you are using (i.e. sword skill), but
    there is a certain percentage that remains unused and you may choose to place them where
    you will -- to your skills or attributes. For instance, you may choose to raise you
    endurance, or coordination by spending some of these unused experience points on them.
    Your husband needs to get out there and kill, but not apply the experience to anything
    until he has enough built up to pay his penalty and to reswear to someone. Then, if the
    patron agrees, have him ask the Patron to RELEASE him. If the Patron releases him, he is
    not penalized. He will be a free agent again, without a penalty. The penalty only applies
    when a vassal breaks from the Patron. Hope that answered you!</small></font></p>

    <small>Here is a definite newbie question for the FAQ's.&nbsp; What is a &quot;Buff&quot;?
    &nbsp; At first I thought it was something akin to a cow but soon realized I was &nbsp;
    wrong.&nbsp; I suspect that this may be too broad a question for a quick answer. Could
    someone point me to a source of info on this subject.<br>

    <br>
    <small>Well, I think this mail really speaks for itself! But so people don't get the wrong
    impression about the PCPunks crew, I feel I should mention that one of the editors of
    PCPunks contacted me today and said that they would check into the content theft and would
    be happy to take the two copied quests down. The explanation was quite satisfactory --
    they get hundreds of emails a day and it's quite difficult to verify all sources. After
    all, as he stated himself, stolen content is bad for business! When they get around to
    removing them, I will retract all negative comments I have made about PCPunks! </small><br>

    <p><small><strong><font face="Arial">April 3, 2000 - Fashion Plate</font></strong></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hiya!<br>
    I am an absurdly fashion conscious modern Derethian woman and I wanna know where the
    dressing rooms are!!!&nbsp; I spend 3K on something, try it on and I look like a Sho-Mart
    bargain bin reject!&nbsp; Is there any way you can tell at least what color something will
    be?&nbsp; Why were my gold bracers copper colored?<br>
    *grin*</small><br>
    <small><br>
    You seem like the type of person to ask this as well. I've seen some gorgeous green
    breastplates, not the green mire (EEEK! 70's green!&nbsp; Saw enough of that back then!)
    but an emerald green color.&nbsp; Any idea what it may have been?&nbsp; No matter how
    polite I am in asking, I often get no response or absurd responses.&nbsp; I know 1 was a
    kouri (sp?) and since I've only been playing a month, I don't expect to see that soon, but
    are some copper breastplates green? Someone told me a gold yoroi was green when worn. Any
    ideas?</small><br>
    <small><br>
    Thanks!&nbsp; If you have any suggestions, could you please reply to <a href="mailto:beechjenn@earthlink.net">xxxxx@earthlink.net</a> as I am currently wasting
    time at work and .... Well, hate getting caught... LOL!<br>

    <small>Jaide</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Hi Jaide --<br>
    As far as I can gather, there is no way to know what color something will be when worn
    just from IDing it, unless someone has been kind enough to inscribe the info. But
    sometimes, the color will actually match! I bought a chain breastplate that was only AL50,
    simply because it was the same rich deep purple of the girth I liked so much. If you're
    looking for a particular color, best thing to do is trade with someone actually wearing
    it. This would be great information to gather, though! What colors are yielded by what
    armor types? I'll put it on my To-Do List!<br>
    <br>
    I'm attaching a pic of a Pyreal Platemail Cuirass and a Pyreal Heaume. Is that the color
    you're looking for? It's very rare, from what I gather. Sad to say, but I have quite a
    collection of pics like this! Ha. Might be hard to believe, but in real life, I hate to
    shop!</small></font></p>

    wearing what I'm hoping to eventually find.&nbsp; <em>Any</em> idea what it is? *Still
    giggling* - the link is exquisite and flows like a gentle stream, as the author would put
    it, running in rivulets as does rain down a window pane! Oddly enough, I vastly prefer
    virtual shopping myself. </font></small></p>

    <br>
    I have a small compendium myself of info I've been gathering since the first beta which is
    quite extensive (over 50 pages - easily). Though, it's hard to keep up with the changing
    times ;)<br>
