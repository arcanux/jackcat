    <p>I managed to fill my decanters on that quest tonight with the help of 
    another archer and an alchemist, both over level 100. Neither of them got 
    their essence, the dungeon was quite challenging.<br>
    <br>
    You fight the new mixed elementals most of the way down. We fought our way 
    down the first time, subsequent times we ran to the penultimate jump and 
    logged out. The monsters vanish in 10 seconds. The alchemist proved unable 
    to survive the logout, melee D is very helpful. So we were down to two by 
    the final room.<br>
    <br>
    The final room is pretty much impossible to muscle through. A team large 
    enough to do it would probably lag out. After doing one point of damage to 
    the Crystal Golem Imperitor after an imperil, we decided to give up on 
    fighting.<br>
    <br>
    The key to getting the essence filled with a small team is to have one guy 
    with a shield jump down and tank in the west corner. That lets the other guy 
    fill his essence in the corner near the exit portal. Both can get out if the 
    guy filling his jars runs back to draw off some spawn and open a hole. He 
    will have to tank a few elementals in peace<span lang="en-us"> </span>mode while filling jars. Your 
    back will be to the monsters when filling the jars, and it is quite slow and 
    fiddly. <br>
    <br>
    My companion failed to get it to work at all. <br>
    <br>
    Corpse retrievals in the final room are possible, using the same basic 
    tactics. One guy jumps in and tanks, the other sneaks in and retrieves.<br>
    <br>
    Good luck to all future people. On Solclaim the room is littered with 
    standing corpses.</p>

    A number of us could not rest in the dungeon high about Shoushi. While our 
    under-70 friends were being shell<span lang="en-us">-</span>shocked in their attempts to fill Decanters 
    with pure essence, we mustered a party of two full fellowships and fought 
    the beast guarding the flow of pure mana -- indeed we fought it for two 
    hours. It stood three times the height of an adult diamond golem and its 
    protectors were elemental beast that resisted the mages and melees alike. 
    Its protectors were killable, but each took minutes per - enough time to 
    allow a replacement to respawn.<br>
    <br>
    Many folks were instrumental in the kill, and I'm sure I will miss a name; 
    but for approximately one hour, Puncture stood steady engaging the elemental 
    beasts while we all re<span lang="en-us">-</span>buffed, re<span lang="en-us">-</span>engaged and continued the fight. Hannibal X 
    had the wherewithal to obtain a portal tie and recruit more into the fight.
    <br>
    <br>
    It took the skills of spec life mages to land yields, specialized warriors 
    to whittle at him, and even a few non-spec mages like myself to assist with 
    some melee fighting, rebuffs, supplying stamina, supplies and support for 
    the fight.<br>
    <br>
    Tarnellius won the kill... and the prize. He will have to settle for 
    bragging rights. This golem with tens of thousands of hit points and stamina 
    dropped a Coord 4 Gemstone and a nonsense gem worth 135 pyreals. 
    <span lang="en-us">But</span> the 
    victory was a sweet as if it had dropped Crystalline Armor.<br>

    the Exarch Magma Golem.</span></b></p>
    <p>I went down the dungeon with an Axeman, an Archer, and a Mage accompanying me. The four of us failed on the 
    first attempt, but reaped rampant veng<span lang="en-us">ea</span>nce on the second attempt after 
    getting VII's put on all of us (we tried with one buffer and some VI's 
    thrown in... I guess I should've waited for him to turn in his scrolls... 
    oops...). I also managed to get his stats off of him while we had most of 
    the spawn wiped out (I thought of the site just before going down and asked 
    for a Monster Attunement buff).<br>
    <br>
    The first attempt, he wasn't fully debuffed, so I was only doing 6-10 (my 
    dagger ran out too) damage. On the second, he was fully debuffed (Imperil, 
    Frost, and Pierce... ok, I didn't get a chance to make our archer those 
    greater frosts I wanted to give him) and I was getting shots off of 60-80 
    with crits of 170 thrown in. Our three main attackers and our mage throwing 
    in frost bolts now and then managed to topple this horrible giant.<br>
    <br>
    The initial spawn was wiped out in seconds, ring spells and mage defense 
    methods are a good idea here (get anything attacking your mage to attack 
    you). Our archer shot down from above. We cleared all but one or two from 
    the main room. Guess they didn't want to join the fun. During the main 
    battle with the Exarch, we immediately got rid of any flammas that were 
    spawned. We kept this up until the Exarch was fully debuffed, then we w<span lang="en-us">h</span>aled 
    on it with all of our might. After a minute or two, we had crumbled the 
    monstrosity and filled our decanters from the mana font waiting just beyond 
    the ramp. I would've taken a screenshot of our little group in front of the 
    Mana Font itself, but I wasn't looking forward to seeing the Exarch again 
    that soon (that's what my Axeman is for).<br>
    <br>
    Several suggestions to those who read this: Get l<span lang="en-us">e</span>v<span lang="en-us">e</span>l VII buffs for life 
    (Bludgeon and Fire). Settle for nothing less as they will NOT last long 
    enough to complete this place (it isn't so easy to rush down there, we lost 
    our archer pretty quickly trying to do that). Have MANY stam elixers (<span lang="en-us">I</span> was 
    carrying 80, as many as I could to remain unburdened). Melees take treated 
    kits, you'll be healing a lot and often (hotkey two of them if you want). 
    Vulns are ESSENTIAL! You'll be w<span lang="en-us">h</span>aling on that Exarch forever without them 
    (5000 health and I as a dagger started hitting fully buffed with 10's - 
    20's) and you don't have that kind of time with the flammas spawning.<br>
    <br>

    Boobie Dress Redux</span></b></p>
    <p>I remember reading about the dresses on your website a few years ago. One of 
    the goals of almost all my female characters (and I have a few, as a 
    Role-Player, though I am a male in RL) is to get all the dresses. <br>
    <br>
    What this concerns is your feelings on the so-called boobie dress. Do you 
    feel that the Devs have resolved the issues you were concerned about, or do 
    you feel they slid more?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks </p>
    <p>Gueron<span lang="en-us"> of FF</span><br>
    Level 31<span lang="en-us"> </span>Axe Specialist</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Gueron -<br>
    Interesting question. It's certainly been a while since the Great Boobie 
    Dress Wars. ;-) For the newer people to the game, I'll just briefly recap 
    some of the concerns that were expressed when the dress was added. My personal disappointment was the addition of asymmetrical sexual 
    content; the women had content added to make them look &quot;sexy&quot;, 
    but the men did not. I felt that they had hard-coded an attitude about women 
    into the game that had not previously existed on Dereth. </span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">(I will refer to the dress as 
    the &quot;Boobie Dress&quot; because that is the name that has &quot;stuck&quot; over time in 
    the community, as often happens. I'd also like to take this opportunity to 
    apologize for coining the term &quot;Chicken Hat&quot; for the beautiful Siraluun 
    Headdress! ;-)</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">One Boobie Dress critic said 
    that she felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by the addition of the dress. I understood what she 
    meant. When I first began to play AC, I was so taken by the way the men and 
    women were designed equally in every way. This was *real* fantasy!! You 
    know, the kind where the size of a woman's breasts or being &quot;sexy&quot; was 
    irrelevant. So totally different from other games I had seen (UO's Xena 
    armor, EQ's Elf, and more recently, AO's implants). I said to myself: &quot;This 
    is a company who realizes that over half the current Internet users are 
    female and is making a game that has a completely non-hostile environment 
    for girls. They are forward thinking and enlightened.&quot; And then I added: &quot;Wheeeeee! 
    oh-my-god-this-is-so-cool!!!&quot; </span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">The outcry and strong feelings 
    on all sides was a good indication that the dress really touched on tensions 
    and issues that currently exist in the culture at large. I think some of the 
    initial responses were handled badly by the Devs and they perhaps should 
    have anticipated the possible range of reactions ahead of time (such as the 
    187 screenshots I got in my email that patch with overhead views of cleavage 
    and &quot;BOOBIES!!!!!!&quot; in the subject line ;-). Turbine finally publicly 
    settled on a position of &quot;more choice&quot; along with assurances that they 
    weren't heading down the slippery-slope. That was definitely the stance to 
    take and one I couldn't really find fault with (although the question, and 
    the crux of my concerns remained: why was it necessary for the women only to 
    have the choice to be &quot;sexy&quot;).</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">I feared, however, that the 
    damage was done. Something was gone irretrievably. Forever. That's how I 
    felt then. Which brings us back around to your question. Do I still feel 
    that way?</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">I must admit, I look fondly back 
    on my gut level appreciation of the early (what I always liked to think of 
    as) purity of vision with nostalgia. But maybe it was unrealistic to not 
    expect the real world to intrude, with its market forces and messy 
    multitudes of viewpoints and desires. </span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Here is where I stand now: the 
    game is not the same game it was then. The Boobie Dress is just one of the 
    many gender specific pieces of clothing to have entered the game. It no 
    longer has the same impact it had when its uniqueness emphasized its 
    over-obvious sexuality. Then there's the Siraluun Dress which I like to 
    personally think of as &quot;balance&quot; for the Boobie Dress, showing that gender 
    specific clothing is more than just about exposing some breastage and sexy-ing 
    up the chicks, but can also be about strength and power and kick-ass 
    protections.</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">So in conclusion (hee hee, yes, 
    finally! how I do run on!), I think Turbine has kept their word and has 
    *not* gone further down the slippery-slope. When this particular camel stuck 
    his nose under the tent, someone on the other side whapped it.</span></font></p>

    <p>Dear Maggie,<br>
    I was just relaxing in my cottage the other day, polishing my garden 
    drudge, when my AC husband <span lang="en-us">Lai Blip</span> came rushing in through the door, a look of 
    bewilderment on his face, as well as a healthy shiner to boot! It would seem 
    that while adventuring, he happened upon a woman who he <i>thought</i> was his 
    cherished wife, and had snuck up behind her to giver her the ol' bum 
    squeeze. Flinging around in shock and outrage, this woman, who was not his 
    wife, did not seem to appreciate strangers fondling her bottom, and popped 
    him a good one, right in the eye.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    He later discovered that this woman was the famed 'Maggie the Jackcat', and 
    had rushed straightaway to my cottage to tell me of the remarkable 
    resemblance between us, squinting through one purpled eye. I immediately set 
    about locating a portrait of you, and discovered that indeed, we could pass 
    as twins, if not clones! What is at play here, dear Maggie? Some foul magic, 
    perhaps... or is there something our parents did not tell us?</p>

    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">What an amazing resemblance! I 
    definitely see it around the eyes. And the nose. And we look to be of an 
    amazingly similar build. Fair complected, to be sure. But your hair. It's 
    much darker. Almost black. And I would think that from the back... I almost 
    hate to suggest this... but from the back, without seeing my face... are you
    <i>sure</i> he mistook... well, uh, nevermind! Thank you for writing. It's a 
    pleasure to meet someone as good-looking as you! ;-)</span></font></p>

    information you've provided us. Actually, I don't even know if anyone of my 
    crew has ever visited your site. I keep telling them to, but they don't 
    really follow directions real well, which is ok. I know I have, and the 
    knowledge it provides me helps me maintain my illusion of omnipotence. Now 
    that I think of it, I'd appreciate it if you could somehow filter out the 
    following folks from accessing your site: Guesclin, No Bueno, Eloy, 
    Moirgainne, Big Gay Chris, Okn the Wikkid, I Dont Wanna Die, Death's

    Thanks for the info! The way I get to be all knowing (hear that, Ned

    this change. I've been carrying around a couple of Atlans for ages, and just 
    couldn't bear to give them up to a Town Crier. They were tucked away in that

    <p>Hey Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I was just reading 
    <a href="April02Letters.htm">Danier<span lang="en-us">'</span>s excellent article</a> on the changes done to the 
    portal system in Dereth, and I'd like to point out one thing - soft ties 
    still exist, in the form of the old portal recall spell. In fact, you can 
    now have a soft tie even though you have tied to both a primary and a 
    secondary portal. This is HIGHLY useful when out questing, since it means 
    that everyone can get back for their corpse.... <br>

    would give us a prize. <span lang="en-us">W</span>ithout hesitation
