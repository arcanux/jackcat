    General Maps</a> page updated! Many broken links removed. New links to
    dungeon maps, portal maps, new land masses, and other maps added. In
    addition, I resurrected some very old AC maps of the different heritage
    regions that used to be found on the old Turbine AC site. Town Maps updating

    page in the Tourism section updated as well with the Dark Majesty goodies.
    They're all grouped under Marae Lassel instead Redspire/Timaru, etc. on the
    page to make them easier to use. The Maps are still woefully outdated and
    full of broken links, but I hope to update the pages soon to finish out the

    and talking to people in-game. However, I'd like to mention the following:
    1) Please do not track me down in-game to ask about being on the Runway.
    This will not increase your chances; 2) I do not know when houses will be
    going on the market, or where they are currently for sale. I have no inside
    information. I repeat: I have no inside information!! 3) If you call me a
    &quot;lier&quot; because you think you have found inaccurate information on
    the site (which, by the way, *was* accurate, you moron), you will be
    immediately squelched. If you <i>must</i> insult me, or bad-mouth my site, I
    prefer email, so I can at least get some good content for the Letters
    section out of it! 4) No, I do not need a Patron.</font>&nbsp;</p>
