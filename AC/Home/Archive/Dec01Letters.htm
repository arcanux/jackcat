    <p><b>December 11, 2001 -&nbsp; Tale of a Tusker: &quot;Pun's Outing&quot;</b>
    </p>
    <p>I was in the heart of the dungeon the locals call the Black Spawn Den. It was a shabby little hole in the
    wall; the Portal Ride in was riddled with turbulence. I had first discovered the damned Dungeon when a clueless mage had
    supposedly summoned the "Subway"... I knew I wasn't there when my calls for an explanation echoed around the corner, and caught the
    gibbled ear of a Tusker Guard.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p> So there I was, standing in my towel, with my Zombie mask over my head, drool leaking from my gaping
    maw staining the inside of my mask, a huge Tusker running at me full bore. I threw my
    collector Tusker Wand into my hand as I tried to run. The Guard behind me, seeing his
    auntie's shrunken head shoved onto a pole, went into a fury. As I turned, my
    limited edition Tusker Backpack was exposed. I don't think that helped any, either. I stopped to recall, but my spell was interrupted by his fist slamming into, and through, my spine. Wow... I was sent flying into the Lifestone before I could say Asheron's yer Uncle... so... you got the BSD? I need to recover a corpse...<br>
    <br>
                                ***<br>

    Heh heh, anyway, that's my little story. I call it "Pun's Outing&quot;...
    Anyways, I wanna tell you just how much I like your site. Like you don't get enough people telling you that... and
    I'd just like to say that I'm the Vitae King. On my level 48 character I have racked up an impressive 14.8k deaths! And
    I'm dead serious. Because of this, I DON'T LEAVE CORPSES! Only the items I lose on death. Of course this
    isn't Pun. Its a different character who id like to leave nameless.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p> By the way, which world do you play on? I'm on Wintersebb and would like to meet the legend...
    Well, that's all I have to say for now... I know you prolly get -alot- of emails, and
    I won't be discouraged if you don't reply... I'll just send the message over and over again until your entire system cracks, sending millions of bytes of information streaming out of your computer, filling your house, drowning you to death in a MASS OF SWIRLING MINDLESS MADNESS! MWA HAH HAH HAH HAH HEE HEE HEE HAH HEEE!<br>

    <p><b>December 11, 2001 -&nbsp; Aun Ralirea and the Skill Credit Quest</b><br>
    <br>
    Maggie,<br>
    I thought I'd send you a little more info on Aun Ralirea and the skill credit quest.  Aun Ralirea is a level 111 Tumerok.  He casts
    level 4 and 5 war, creature, and (POSSIBLY) life spells.  When I fought him yesterday, he hit me with every type war spell there is (slashing, bludgeoning, electrical, frost, etc ).  He also debuffed me with Vulnerability 5 and Magic Yield 5.  The weapon is definitely hollow.  I had my
    AL 223 base Amuli coat on and my AL 183 base Amuli legs on.  I was fully buffed with 5s in
    Life and Impen on the coat and Amuli legs.  He never hit me for under 15
    damage.  My best advice is to fully buff w/ life protects for his war spells and let him shoot war spells at you until
    he's out of mana.  Also, when I found him, he was surrounded by Aun Elder Shamans.  I pulled him out by
    imperiling him.  Be careful with this mofo.<br>
    <br>

    <p><b>December 11, 2001 -&nbsp;Mace Fighter Chooses Lilitha's Bow</b>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        As a Mace fighter I have come across a reason to carry a bow. Simply put, the island is packed with monsters that you don't want to fight all at once, so many melees have started to carry a bow to draw just what they want out of the pack. But to carry a 980bu bow just to get the 80yd range is crazy even if it does have +113% damage.
        It's not like a melee can really shoot anyway. So I personally have
        chosen to quest for Lilitha's 80yd 450bu low damage bow. The side perk is that
        it's cool looking and matches my dress. lol&nbsp;<br>

        <p>Hi Maggie!<br>
    <br>
    First I must say I love your website. Any time I need info on AC I check your site first. I would be lost without it. LOL<br>
    <br>
    Today a friend and I were wandering carefully around the plateau of ML with our level 43
        battlemages and we ran across some Small Golems. Talk about cute! I didn't see them on the Dark Majesty pages, so I thought I'd let you know about them. They were level 383 and exactly like miniature diamond golems. I never laughed so hard hitting the lifestone before. We did manage to kill two of them before the third one killed me. They were in a group of 5 and quite slow moving, kind of like the very small shadows are. All 3 dropped a mote,
        a SIK, and a heart along with various gems. They yell Blood! at you when you first attack and on death they yell "Blo-ack!". I probably wouldn't have died as it's easy to step out of their way, but I was laughing too hard. LOL One
        tip: bane those sollies. For little guys, they have a huge stomp. ;)<br>

        <p><b>December 11, 2001 -&nbsp;Can You Customize Swords?</b></p>
    <p> Hi&nbsp;<br>
    I am Bloody Bassist of Solclaim (sorry, I just want to sound big), and I have a question. Is there any way to "customize" swords, i.e. put different crystals on it, or infuse it with different things?
    I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not you can go beyond the loot or quest swords?
    If there is a way, PLEASE let me know.&nbsp;<br>

        There is no way to customize swords, beyond slapping some Item Spells on
        them. They are what they are. The only Sword that can be infused is the
        Sword of Lost Light Quest Sword. It's a cool idea, but... needs new

        Maggie,<br>
        First, let me say that I am a big fan of your site. You give us, the
        brave adventurers of Auberean, all the information we need to complete
        our quests and to generally keep informed of &quot;world&quot; events.
        And you do it in way that demonstrates that AC can be a lot more than
        just a &quot;hack and slash&quot;<br>
        kind of game. I applaud you.<br>
        <br>
        My primary reason for writing, however, is to applaud another
        individual.<br>
        All too often we hear complaints about thieves, grief players, and
        &quot;Kewl Doodz.&quot; That's why I wanted to tell you about an
        individual who deserves our praise.<br>
        <br>
        I've recently been camping an Olthoi Horde Nest (did you know that
        Olthoi have a creamy, nougat center?). Last week I had an unfortunate
        experience. I assume you've been there, so you know how easy it is to
        get turned around (I miss the days of the Lugian Citadel and its
        right-angles). Well, I was in a hallway, got turned around, and then
        about 2,000 Olthoi Workers spawned around me (okay, maybe more like 12).
        I tried to run, and then I got the dreaded yellow chain--you guessed it,
        the Lag-Monster. Well, when it went back to green I had just enough time
        to glimpse a room before I was kicked reeling back to my Lifestone. I
        had no idea where my corpse was, no idea how to navigate that terrible
        hive, nor the power to wade through all those bugs to get my
        corpse--which contained my NEWLY imbued Shield of the Simulacra.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It was getting late. I was tired. I had a lot
        to do the next day. I was standing in the entrance realizing that the
        vitae penalty was going to prevent me from casting my usual level 5
        buffs when two figures appeared from outside. I shamefully asked for
        their help and offered to pay them each an SIK for their troubles. They
        agreed and we began scouring that accursed place. After a LONG time,
        just when it seemed like we were out of luck, one of them called out,
        &quot;I found it!&quot;. I got my Shield and Master Robes and gave them
        their Keys as promised. They RETURNED the keys and said, &quot;That
        isn't necessary, we're glad to help&quot;. Their names are Innigo and
        Jyun Tsai-Xi. They have my gratitude and greatest respect.<br>
        <br>
        Last night my brother, Sadiq al-Harb, also lost a corpse in OHN. Guess
        who showed up to help him? Innigo. Innigo set a great example of how
        much more fun this game would be if we all worked together. I salute
        him.&nbsp;<br>
