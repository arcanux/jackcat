        Matron Hive information</b><p>What's inside: Regular Soldiers (L79, not 
        61), Swarm Soldiers and Nobles (L80, the blue ones) up top. Not very 
        many, however. Very very soon, you get nothing but Swarm Eviscerators 
        (lots and lots and LOTS of these) and Warriors (not so many). Archers, 
        bring tons of arrows if you're alone. Melee, you'll want to load up on 
        stam biscuits (field rations). Respawn is roughly 3 minutes anywhere you 
        are in there, so rebuffing inside is tricky. There are a couple spots 
        where only two or three bugs can get to you at once. The exit portal at 
        the end is in a small room across from the entrance to the Queen's 
        room--if you can make it in there, and not lag out the portal, it's 100% 
        safe.<br>
        <br>
        The dungeon is neither recallable nor summonable, but you can log out 
        inside.<br>
        <br>
        The Adolescent Matron is fairly to decently easy to kill. She's got a 
        good amount of armor, about a thousand health (estimated; couldn't ID 
        her), and is level 115. She *feels* like a big Brood Noble with more 
        armor; same fast regen, for sure. Is blue and red. There are two in 
        there for sure; might be more, but I saw only two.<br>
        <br>
        The Adolescent Queen is green and red, has about twice the health of the 
        Matron (about 2,000; again, couldn't ID her), has 1/3 more armor 
        (derived from comparing the difference in average-damage hits on her and 
        the Matron), and is level 120. There are two of these in there as well, 
        one on each side of a split corridor right near the end.<br>
        <br>
        It's a very long way down to the first Matron, but once you find her, 
        you're about 70% done with the place--the next Matron, then the two 
        Queens, are very soon after that.<br>
        <br>
        The Matron drops one of three things: The tarsis (foot thing), the tail, 
        and the tibia (pincer thing). The Queen drops two items per kill in one 
        of three groups that I noticed. One is the head and stab claw; the other 
        two groups I don't know, because I lagged through the exit portal before 
        I could kill her enough to get everything. Would imagine it goes 
        thorax/femur and crest/carapace. So, you have to kill each one at least 
        three times until they drop the stuff you need to complete the suit.<br>
        <br>
        Completed armor is both droppable and giveable, and early reports 
        indicate it's dyeable--the blue lines, not the purple panels, are what 
        changes color.<br>
        <br>
        Lots of info. Hope some of it's useful. :)<br>

        Hola Maggie! <br>
        Just got back from the 60-80 matron dungeon and thought
        <span lang="en-us">I</span> should write you. First thing. Matron is 
        super easy to find. When you first drop from the portal, go straight 
        ahead down the ramp after you clear the spawn. Once down, kill any 
        olthoi in the area and head to the left. Go north as much as possible 
        till you find the first acid pit. Once you find it, it's pretty much a 
        straight run to the Matron. Only problem is that my fellow just spent 40 
        minutes camping her spawn so we could all get crests with no luck. She 
        only spawned once in that 40 min<span lang="en-us">utes</span> and 
        didn't drop anything both times. Hope this helps.</p>
        <p>Shuzo<span lang="en-us"> of WE</span><br>
        <br>
        P.S. This is by far the BEST site <span lang="en-us">I</span> have ever 
        seen for anything AC. Keep up the awesome work!<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Shuzo -<br>
        Thanks for the directions! I've been getting a lot of requests for more 
        details!! Good luck getting your undies, and I'm glad you like the site!</span></font></p>
