        Hi Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for the compliment on my ACPL write-up. At ACPL a reporter did a 
        br<span lang="en-us">i</span>ef interview with me. He said it would be 
        in the news a few weeks ago and it wasn't so I figured the story got 
        cut. Then I got news clippings of it in the mail. Check it out at

        Okay, so I'm confused. I thought I remembered you saying you role play a 
        girl and that you are really a guy. Now, I see a picture of you, on your 
        site, and you are female. Also, why is Ned so old, he seems so young? 
        Maybe he is just young at heart.<br>

        <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Rashan the Destroyer -<br>
        Oh dear. This letter made me laugh and laugh. I've never said I was 
        really a guy, although I've read posts on the boards where people claim 
        that I am. And your appraisal of Ned. Made me laugh. I decided I had 
        better get his permission before publishing it. Boys can be so delicate 
        about their age. Here was his suggested reply:</font></font></span></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Do 
          you think *not* publishing it will make me look younger? Me neither. 
          Ned looks old because 1) he was born a long time ago, and it shows, 
          and 2) he stays up way too late playing computer games and arguing on 
          message boards and inventing lies to counter the lies invented by his 
          friends. It's all very wearing -- both physically and mentally 
          draining. The only compensating mechanism is that 3) Ned is, thank 
          God, very immature for his age.</font></span></p>

        I think the elemental spawns are temporarily replacing the normal spawns

        On this page: (at the very bottom)<br>

        It is written: <br>
        <br>
        &quot;Note: even though the Storehouse guards say you can only enter once a 
        week, you are actually able to go through as many times as you want.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        A more correct assessment is: <br>
        <br>
        The Storehouse Guards allow you entry for a period of one week, after 
        which you must wait another week before you can enter again. So if you 
        begin the quest on a Saturday, you have seven days during which you can 
        enter the Storehouses as many times as you need to. On the second 
        Saturday your timer expires and you will not be allowed in for yet 
        another week. On the third Saturday you can gain entry again, for the 
        next 7 day period. <br>

    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Hannibal -<br>
        I'm back! It's rather a tragic tale, but it has a happy ending. First, 
        my business partner was out of town for a week, so I was just a little 
        extra busy in the work arena. A staple attack, I fear, would have been 
        no help. (But thanks for the offer! ;-) Then I had a wedding to go to. 
        Then, well, I was in computer HELL!!
    </span></font></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">My system has been having... 
        issues for several months. Frequent lock-ups, sluggishness, and just 
        general bad behavior. The downward spiral began accelerating and I knew 
        I had to do something fast. I decided the best solution was to wipe my 
        hard drive, get rid of Win98 and do a fresh install of Windows 2000 
        professional. But since I've been kinda sloppy with back-ups and had 
        almost 40GB of data on the drive and had procrastinated myself into a 
        somewhat desperate situation, I decided the quickest easiest way to save 
        all my data was to get a nice new larger zippier hard drive. (This 
        excellent idea was actually my vassal's. He are smart!) I installed the 
        new drive and copied all my data over before the wipe. Then I did the 
        wipe, did the Windows install... and still had issues. Serious issues.</font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">My computer-whiz 
        brother-in-law diagnosed hardware problems: failed hard drive. Or maybe 
        mother board! Whee! I disconnected the old drive, made the new drive the 
        main hard drive and so far so good. I'm back up and running!</font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Ok, so it really wasn't 
        *that* hellish. It could have been a LOT worse. It was just, as these computer things always are, time 
        consuming and a pain in the behind, with brief moments of great panic 
        and fright! It's not like I wasn't using my laptop or didn't have DSL at 
        work. It's just that I prefer working on my main computer at home,
