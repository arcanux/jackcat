    <p><b>August 26, 2001 - ***More info
    re: Ned's Spellcasting Essay!</b>
    </p>
    <p>Just wanted to drop a line on the spellcasting tips essay by Ned. Excellent article, but perhaps he doesn't know this, and it is SUPER
    helpful, so please pass the word to him for me!<br>
    <br>
 When in war mode, the following are also valid commands:<br>
    <br>
    ctrl-insert: go to Last spellbar (V)<br>
    ctrl-page up: go to First spellbar (I)<br>
    ctrl-delete: go to First spell, current spellbar<br>
    ctrl-page down: Go to Last spell, current spellbar<br>
    <br>
    This creates opportunities to further organize spellbars. Needless to
    say, spellbars 1 and 5 are my most important spellbars in light of this.<br>
    <br>
    I put 'urgent' spells at the beginning of a spellbar so that they can
    be instantly addressed by number (ie: Drain health is ALWAYS 7 for me). I put
    frequently used but 'not so urgent' spells at the end of a spellbar (ie: heal others, portals, non-mage related self buffs, true value) where they
    are instantly accessible no matter where I am on the current spellbar, with just a few keystrokes (as few as 2! ctrl-pagedown+end to cast the very last
    spell on the bar)<br>
    <br>
    I'm sure there are aspects of this that I may be missing which some
    other brilliant mind out there may think up or even already know, so keep your
    thinking caps on!

    Yes, that Ned Cleversun is a smart boy. *I* didn't know some of this stuff!
    :-) Great info! I passed your letter on to my vassal who said that he *had*
    known about those commands, but just didn't think to put them into <a href="../../Ned/Tip6.htm">his

    <p><b>August 26, 2001 - Tips on
    Spellcasting Key Setups</b>
    </p>
    <p>I read Cleversun's new tips on spellcasting key setup with interest. However, I feel I must add my own 2 pyreals, because I feel I have a nice
    alternative. It is less intuitive than using the navigation keys, but here goes:<br>
    <br>
    I reconfigured my AC to use other keys for movement. I prefer to have
    my left hand near the TAB key, and the right hand on the mouse. The left block
    of my &quot;crooked&quot; Natural Keyboard has these keys<br>
    <br>
    1 2 3 4 5 6<br>
    Q W E R T<br>
    A S D F G<br>
    Z X C V B<br>
    <br>
    Q W E are used for turn left, forward and turn right<br>
    A S D are for Step left, back, and step right<br>
    Z X&nbsp; are used for sit, rise<br>
    <br>
    Now I use R T for Id and Cast spell.<br>
    I use&nbsp; F for prev spell and G for next spell.<br>
    I then use V for prev tab and B for next tab.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;That means I have spell tab navigation, casting and use of shortcut
    keys 1-6 at my left hand's fingertips. That is very efficient since it allows me
    to move around and cast all spells with one hand. Also you can move to the END or BEGINNING of any active spellbar by pushing CTRL+F or CTRL+G, and to
    spell bar 1 with CTRL+v and to spell bar 5 with CRTL+B.<br>
    <br>
    I have put my recall to lifestone spell on tab 5, last position. In a jeopardy I can quickly recall by pushing CTRL-B, then CRTL-G and lastly T
    for casting the spell. This also allows you to put the recall command on a
    keyboardmacro, like I use my MS Strategic Commander for. Also it prevents you from
    accidentally casting Portal Recall while in a heated combat situation. I have done that a couple of times during a quest that I lead,
    because my recall was on shortcut 9. Quite embarrassing.<br>

    <font color="#FFFF80">Hi Immacolata -<br>
    Thanks for the letter. I'm sure people will really enjoy hearing how someone
    else has customized their keyboard commands. I'm not that adventurous with
    my commands and stick pretty much to the basics, I'm afraid.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">The last point in your letter really caught my eye,
    though. I, too, have accidentally hit my portal recall button at the most
    inopportune moments! I spent half the day making my way to Rumuba's Hidey
    Hole when the Vesayen Isles were first opened. Unfamiliar territory, many,
    many bodies to recover, and the routes to the island were still unfamiliar,
    so even getting back there was a big ordeal. Finally, my vassal joined me
    and helped me make my way to the dungeon entrance. I equipped my wand to
    buff. Then, pumped and ready for action I reached for my sword (hot key
    5)... remembering too late that I was still in spellcasting mode!!!
    Arrgggghhhh! Yes, you guessed it. Portal Recall was in the #5 spot of my
    spell bar.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">So, I yelled and screamed at my vassal telling him
    it was all his fault, logged out of the game and sulked for the rest of the
    afternoon. (just kidding)</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">I have since moved my Portal Recall spell to a new
    location on the spell bar. ;-)</font>

    Armour Quest</b><br>
    <br>
    Thx for your walkthrough on the Hieromnacer's Quest.&nbsp; I got my Exarch
    plate armour in 4 days :)<br>
    <br>
    After using your walkthrough and completing the quest.&nbsp; You may may
    want to update it with this information.<br>
    <br>
    -- Exarch Plate has no war 270+ requirement.&nbsp; Only Thaumaturgic Plate
    does.&nbsp; The only requirement for Exarch is war specialized.<br>
    <br>
    -- Took me three days to find the acid.&nbsp; Best to look around the
    Slaughterhouse which is where most people go to get to Heiromancer Hall.&nbsp;
    Acid can be found on Virulent and Bane Grievvers, not just Harrowers.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    -- I got my stones first.&nbsp; I concur that its best to get the armour
    before the stones.&nbsp; 50 stones weren't enough to make my armour Exarch at war 280.<br>
    <br>
    -- Exarch can be unkindled.&nbsp; 1st stone makes it Thaumaturgic, 2nd
    Exarch and 3rd unkindled.&nbsp; Possible to unkindle it at any stage as you
    know.<br>
    <br>
    -- All golems at training halls are very weak to frost.&nbsp; Good idea to
    frost vuln and magic yield them.<br>
    <br>
    -- Guardian Golems outside are easy to defeat.&nbsp; Just bolt them and run
    behind wall and repeat until dead.<br>
    <br>
    -- Dont die! The final golem got me to 22 health hehe :)<br>

    <br>
    Maggie,<br>
    How much can one mage say to express his thanks for the incredible web site
    you run? Simple words are not enough, were you on the Harvestgain server I
    would shower you with kisses, gifts and buffs innumerable!<br>
    <br>
    I have another piece of advice for completing the Lyceum. Take 4 or more
    gems of stillness in particular for the last and most difficult of the three
    dungeons. It may be common sense, but I have not seen it printed. The last
    dungeon was easy with these in hand but could have been disastrous without
    them.<br>
    <br>
    Other web sites have noted that the golems can be drained, this is true, but
    for me they only gave up one point of health per drain. So mages should plan
    on strictly taking the vapor golems out with war, AFTER THEY HAVE VULNED the
    baddies as they can be vulned rather safely from a distance. I used the
    quiddity orb to vuln them then changed to my war V orb to take 'em out.<br>

    Keep up the incredible work my dear! You are quite an asset to my life in

    <p>Hey Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    Well my printer is still going.&nbsp; I was so impressed with your website I
    have been printing my favorite pages for the last 2 days! :)<br>
    <br>
    One suggestion, on your pages describing quests, articles, etc.&nbsp; The
    width is a bit too wide for my browser to print the entire page and it cuts
    off the right side, thus I don't get the tips section in most cases.&nbsp;
    Any chance of putting your links on the top or bottom instead of the left?&nbsp;
    Either way it is a great website, I would say the best AC website on the
    net.&nbsp; Keep up the good work.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br>

    get two letters from others saying they LOVE how the site is set up and how

    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Amendment to response: My clever vassal has solved
    the printing problem!! This is cool. All you need to do is upgrade your
    browser to IE 5.5. It has a built-in smart print preview option which allows
    you to format your page setup so that everything prints properly. Once you
    have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/ie55sp1.htm?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D25479%26redirect%3Dno" target="_blank">Internet
    Explorer 5.5</a> installed go to File, then Page Setup on your Internet
    browser. If you change the left and the right hand margins to .4&quot; then
    the page should display correctly. (Top and bottom margins can remain the
    same.) I also recommend going to Tools/Internet Options/Advanced and make
    sure that the &quot;Print background colors and images&quot; is not
    selected. Now go to your favorite page, choose the Print Preview option and
    voila! You should see a nice printable version of your favorite page. Pretty
    slick! And certainly a lot easier than redesigning the whole site! ;-)</font>

    <p>If you don't mind, I would like to know HOW Ned Shot a shadow for 606 pts
    damage? I mean, what spell was thrown onto the shadow, what arrow did he
    use, and what his bow skill is. I am in a dungeon with Drudge Raveners by
    the dozen, all by myself, and am trying to find the best arrow to kill them
    with. First I tried slashing: 24-34 damage with some crits as high as 70. Then 
    greater slashing, and still the same
    range. Then fire arrows, with the
    same range. Then greater fire arrows, with average 40 pts damage, sometimes as high as 80.
    
    <p> How does someone do 606 pts damage???? I am using the Comp
    bow with a 230 buffed skill level. I think I have about a 13 damage
    modifier. What am I doing wrong? Are vulns really that big a difference in
    the damage that you do? And how does a person throw a spell and switch to a bow in time to kill
    something? What am I missing here??? Anyway any help you can give will be

    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80">The 606 was my personal best against an Umbris. As the 
    infomercials on TV say: these results are not typical. A lot of factors came together. 
    I have pretty good Life and Item magic. I start with Greater frog crotch arrows and 
    a composite bow made from the finest materials crafted by specialists (not me!) with 
    very high skill. Then I add BD7, HS7, Def7, and SK7. My working bow skill is 301, 
    exactly. The resulting package is so horrible that many monsters turn and run when I 
    bring the bow out. Before shooting this particular Umbris, I dropped Imperil 6 on it, 
    followed by Blade Vulnerability 5.
    
    <p align="left">Using this system, Umbris sometimes die with one shot and usually die in fewer than 
    4 or 5 shots. The trick, of course, is not to die yourself. That is not always easy!</font>
    
    <p align="left">&gt; I am in a dungeon with Drudge Raveners by the dozen, all by myself, and am trying 
    to find the best arrow to kill them
    with.
    
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80">I have standardized on Greater frog crotch arrows, and use 
    Greater Armor Piercing or Greater blunts for special situations. Greaters work better, 
    enough better to make them worth whatever trouble it takes to get them. I avoid elemental 
    arrows.</font>
    
    <p align="left">&gt; are vulns really that big a difference in the damage that you do?
    
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80">Vulns make a breathtaking difference. A good, solid Imperil 
    can easily triple or quadruple the damage done by each shot. The problem is that it 
    can be difficult to get past the resistance of any particular monster. Vulnerability 
    spells and Imperils have created a lot of dead archers, let me tell you! Half of my 
    deaths (currently over 1200) came while I was standing on the battlefield failing to 
    Imperil a monster. It is a wretched, embarrassing way to die. But when you hit, 
    ahh ...then they are toast.</font>
    
    <p align="left">&gt; and how does a person throw a spell and switch to a bow in time to kill
    something? What am I missing here???&nbsp;
    
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF80">This is an excellent question. There is a trick to it, as 
    you inferred there might be. Use the control key to switch between the wand and the 
    bow, with each assigned a shortcut number. My bow has been in the #8 slot since I 
    started, with my wand or orb in #1.
    Ctrl/8 brings up the bow straight from the wand.
    
    <p align="left">But it is not instant, beware! It still takes a steady heart and strong nerves to 
    stand firm while a monster is charging and attacking. Many times I've had to grit my 
    teeth and tense my body to resist the visceral urge to break and run. It is a scary 
    business. But if you do it right -- WHACK! You get some monster beat-up that is very 
    cool.
