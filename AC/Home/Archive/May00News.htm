    the Jackcat</a> shows off her sexy new leggings on the Runway!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I also changed the Fire Auroch Meat to show that
    it restored Health, not Stamina on the <a href="../../Food/food2.htm">Food</a> page, plus removed the
    incorrect portal information from Khayyaban to Yanshi on the <a href="../../Travel/portals.htm">Towns &amp; Portals</a> page, which
    actually didn't exist, but led right into a dungeon! Sorry guys!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Thanks Pharfig Neugan and Sunny D for pointing
    out the errors!</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 28, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>As I promised, I'll be adding several more additions to the Runway,
    including myself!! I want to look my best, you know. But for now, here's another of
    Dereth's most fashionable ladies: Nocta of Leafcull. The outfit is absolutely smashing! <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Nocta.htm">Take a look</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 26, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small><a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Subutai.htm">Subutai</a>
    is on the Runway! I finally got the page finished of Subutai wearing his Greater Koujia
    Shadow Armor. Thanks for posing! I also added the new Greater Amuli Shadown Armor stats on
    the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow Armor</a> page
    thanks to Achmed II of Leafcull. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Congratulations to Mary the Mad II of
    Morningthaw who got her Peerless Atlan Mace just the other night! And thanks for sending
    in the missing pic for my <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Atlan.htm">Atlan
    Weapons</a> pages. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Thanks also to Chronus of Harvestgain for letting me know the stats of the updated
    stats of the Peerless <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Atlan2.htm">Atlan
    Sword</a> since the patch.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 25, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New stuff! Ok, well, I didn't finish the Runway piece of him wearing it
    yet, but I *did* get the updated stats of the Greater Koujia Shadow Armor contributed by
    Subutai of Thistledown up on the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow Armor</a> page. Plus I
    added a note under the Nexus Armor, making people aware that it was one time loot only --
    one set per server. You simply would not <em>believe</em> the amount of mail I get asking
    about it!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Thanks to Archer from Hell for the pic of the
    Tiny Shard!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a>
    Section. See Maggie cave in to vanity!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Put the <a href="24Apr00Newsletter.htm">April 24 Newsletter</a>
    up.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated Ned Cleversun's Stats: Loyalty up by 1;
    Deaths up by 9. Does that seem unbalanced to you?!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 24, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Well, I've actually been playing the game lately, so no time for updates!
    ;-) But I'll do more soon. Going live with the <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">Crossroads of Dereth</a> quest section helped to introduce my site to many
    new people, plus it filled my inbox with<em> lots</em> of mail that still needs to be
    answered. I don't know how Allen Grey does it!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I'll have several new additions to the Runway in
    the near future, including ...Maggie the Jackcat! I just got some kick-ass stuff and want
    to show it off -- something even better than a purple chain girth!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 21, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Still catching up on the Heroes' Respite changes! </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
    Armor</a> page with the new burden stats for the Greater Celdon, thanks to The Cooking Guy
    on Thistledown!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated more of the <a href="../../Food/food2.htm">Foods</a> with the new burden stats.
    Thanks once again to the marvelous Crick the Cook for the research! I also added Royal
    Cabbage as well as a few other missing foods to the page.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the <a href="../../Hobbies/formulas.htm">Alchemical Formulas</a> Page with
    the new Potions, plus added a few other missing formulas.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 19, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Thanks to <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Nan.htm">Nandesu
    Ka</a> and her enterprising brother, Obunaga, I've added the stats to the Lesser Celdon
    Shadow Armor on the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
    Armor</a> page. It's a wonderful shade of deep red. Thanks to both of you!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Ned Cleversun' loyalty creeps up another point
    to 104! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 17, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Matty Coats for everyone! Yes, you guessed it. Ned Cleversun finally has
    his Mattekar Coat thanks to the generosity of Pigroast II. See both <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Ned.htm">Ned Cleversun</a> and <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Pigroast.htm">Pigroast II</a> modeling
    their furs on the Runway. And that's not all! <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Nan2.htm">Nandesu Ka</a> has a Mattie
    Coat as well, thanks to her enterprising brother! I simply cannot forget to mention
    Vilegoroth of Thistledown, who also offered a Matty Coat up to the cause. Yes, there was
    joy in the streets of Zaikhal, most certainly!</small><br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>Additions: </small><br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
    Armor</a> page with information on the new elemental protections. I don't have *any* of
    the new burden stats. For anybody out there who has Shadowhunter Armor, if you could
    please take a minute and <a href="mailto:thejackcat@xrgaming.net">email me</a> with the
    new burden stats, I'd certainly appreciate it! I'm also still missing most of the stats of
    the lowest level Shadow Armor. If anybody has this, I'd love your assistance in filling
    out the section.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the <a href="../../Shopping/Locksmth.htm">Locksmith</a> page with the
    Sturdy Iron Key and put a link to Truebolts page on uber chests.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Changed the <a href="../../Shopping/MagicItm.htm">Magic Items</a> page to reflect
    the change in burden for scrolls, down to 30 from 270! Thanks to David T for the info!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Corrected some coordinates on the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/tikola.htm">Dagger of Tikola</a> quest
    page. Thanks to Angyr for the head's up.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> Section.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 16, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Sadly, I've just been too busy to do much updating. Today's news: Ned
    Cleversun's Death total is up, and his loyalty stat is up three points to 103! What could
    have prompted that?! Well... More news coming soon!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 13, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>During the Heroes' Respite update, foods suddently became lighter! Thanks
    to Crick (of the great <a href="../../Travel/maps3.htm">dungeon
    maps</a>) for helping to compile some of the new burden stats for the <a href="../../Food/food2.htm">Food</a> page. Updated stats are in
    yellow. My favorite: while everything else is reduced in burden, cookies are <em>heavier!!</em></small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 10, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Just a little minor updating fixing misspellings and so forth. I did
    update the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> Section,
    though! Find out what a Terrible Patron Maggie the Jackcat is!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 8, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small><a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Archmage.htm">Archmage
    of Doom</a> is the latest participant on the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a>! I secretly tried on his
    hat when he was busy with his mule. It matches my eyes!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added the new town and Portal coordinates for Ayan Baqur on the <a href="../../Travel/portals.htm">Towns and Portals</a> page. I also
    made several miscellaneous corrections on this page. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added the coordinates to the 13th Spire
    Discovery on the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Spires.htm">Spires</a>
    page. Thanks to the House of the Curious Dead for the discovery!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added a few new map links -- one to the <a href="../../Travel/maps2.htm">Town Maps</a> page for the House of
    the Curious Dead's Ayan Baqur map, and links to two Allegiance portal maps from House of
    Thunder and EpiK under the <a href="../../Travel/maps3.htm">Dereth
    Maps</a> page.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> Section with a response
    to all the questions I've been getting about the Nexus Shadow Armor.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added a page with the sayings of <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Ulgrim.htm">Ulgrim the Unpleasant</a>,
    the new town drunk.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 4, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>The Town Criers are busy talking about fashion. They must have seen <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Nan.htm">Nandesu Ka</a> take a walk down
    the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a>. Check out the
    new addition -- simple yet elegant! Who says you can't go killing in an evening gown?</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added several miscellaneous <a href="../../Apparel/Armor.htm">armor</a> pieces courtesy of Spot
    and David T. Thanks for sending them in!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added a new picture and background color under
    the main <a href="../../Shopping/shopping.htm">shopping</a> page. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added the pack and sack color selections on the <a href="../../Shopping/Money.htm">Currency / Shopping Bags</a> page.
    Thanks to Mareid Longreach for the suggestion.</small><br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>Added my vassal Ned Cleversun's death total to the right of this
    page!</small><br>
    </font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>I also just briefly wanted to mention that my bout of spring

    <font face="Arial"><strong><br>
    <small>May 3, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New Patch!! Yay! Maggie the Jackcat, Sword Fighter, is tickled with the
    latest update. Look at all the goodies! (Already she hears the faint rumblings of the
    Archers preparing their complaints ...unless that rumor about Lilitha's new bow is true!) </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Pigroast II was kind enough to send along a
    picture of the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Respite2.htm" target="_top">new Rapier</a>. If you remember, <a href="Apr00Letters.htm" target="_top">Pigroast
    II</a> was the fellow who accidentally deleted Pigroast I on the way to work one day. His
    pain has saved numerous others from the same fate as Turbine responds with an option to
    restore deleted characters for a limited time! Read all about it along with the rest of
    the build notes <a href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewsmay2build.asp" target="_blank">here</a>!</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>May 1, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Ahh. Spring has sprung. What better way to start the month of May than
    with a new addition to the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm" target="_top">Runway</a>! Check out <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/ItoMenya.htm" target="_top">Ito Menya</a>
    of Frostfell in a sharp looking black suit. The section is proving to be even more popular
    than I expected, so I'll try to add more soon! Thanks again to everyone who has
    volunteered!</small></font></p>
