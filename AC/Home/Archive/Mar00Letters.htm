    Question</font></strong></small><p><font face="Arial"><small>Hi Maggie,</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Thanks for all the info. You've answered quite a few
    lingering questions I've had about certain aspects of the game. I'd like to ask something
    else, however, regarding Frore: how many people should I have accompany me when I do Frore
    itself? I'm a level 28 War/Life Creature Mage, and have a good friend who is level 25. How
    many more people would you suggest? I can call in a few heavy hitters (i.e. lvl 40+) but
    would like a challenge.</font></small></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Thanks for the&nbsp;fan mail! As to your
    Frore question, I know that before the Great Work was destroyed, groups of 15 or so higher
    level players would go through with only a very few making it out alive. Now that Frore is
    just a pale shadow of its former greatness, you can get through it with fewer. However,
    you should probably err on the side of caution. If you die in Frore, you're sort of
    screwed. You *have* to have two people&nbsp;to open the doors, but I don't think you
    should try with less than three at the very minimum, preferably more. You might drop by
    the COD site for further research. I think they've got the stats of the Gelidite Lords
    posted, so at least you'll see what you'll be up against. Good luck! Let me know how it
    turns out!</small></font></p>

    <font face="Arial"><small>Hi Maggie,</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Based on your advice, the quest was a great success!</small> <small>I invited an
    intrepid band of adventurers together for the last leg of the journey. There were nine of
    us in all, ranging in levels from 20, all the way up to 38. We met in Zaikhal as the sun
    set in the land and with high spirits made the long trek to Plateau high in the North-West
    of Dereth. We even picked up a lone Warrior along the way.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">We then reached our destination and had the scholarly woman
    open the portal to Frore. One of the funniest things I've seen in the game was watching 9
    adventurers buffing up to the maximum. The air was filled with protection spells, buffs,
    and god knows what else for about a minute straight. Then, seething with power, we jumped
    into the portal... popping out onto the highest plateau you've ever seen! </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">After quickly dispatching 2 hapless Ice Golems, we then
    descended into the entrance to the lost city itself. After some initial confusion with a
    maze, our stout band found the entrance to Frore and explored the mighty underground city.
    A more beautiful dungeon I have never seen. However, I must admit opposition was rather
    lacking, and in fact, the only time my War Mage got to shine beyond a support role (It was
    bloody cold down there....) was blasting the several Gelidite Lords we met along the way.
    We then found the Gelidite Chest, and Draax took his robe. The Hammer went to Thayne, and
    Heaume of Frore went to Asemeus, as he supplied the Lich Seals making the whole adventure
    possible. The group then portaled to Teth, and everyone made it out unscathed.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I would like to thank everyone who participated in the
    adventure: Gryth the Guide, Al'lan Mandragoran, Demascus, Miru, Sammathia the Maze
    Cracker, Thantos, Leng the archer, and the dependable Dr. McCoy. </font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">Since then, I've been invited to Frore twice more, and plan
    to help anyone who wants to complete this incredible adventure.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial">Just wanted to let you know that your site is GREAT!<br>
    <br>
    I also had a question about Frore.&nbsp; I am looking for a good axe and I<br>
    wandered onto your site and saw the stats on the Silver Battle Axe in Frore. PLEASE tell
    me that the axe still exists there.&nbsp; I don't care about anything but that awesome
    axe.<br>
    <br>
    I have one other question.&nbsp; I know that the Great Work is gone, but what about the
    lvl 80+ undead?&nbsp; My friends and I are trying to get&nbsp; together a small party to
    go there.&nbsp; Right now, we are all about lvl 25 - 31, with a good mix of fighters and
    mages.&nbsp; Does that sound good?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for your help,</font></small></p>

    <font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Thanks Brian Boru'!<br>
    Yes, as far as I know, the axe still exists, although the staff is now gone. But did you
    look at the stats carefully? Axe skill required 394+! It's more of a trophy than anything
    else. And as I understand it, the level 80+ undead is also gone now. You will, however,
    run into the Gelidite Lords and some Golems. Sounds like a great group. Have fun!</small></font></p>
