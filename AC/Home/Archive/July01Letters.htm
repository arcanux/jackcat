    <p><b>July 31, 2001 - Explorer Quest Unfair To Xbow </b>
    </p>
    I just want to point out that the Society Letter/Explorer quests allows
    archers access to elemental arrows (50 of each) with a red letter to/from
    Shoushi/Al-Arquas. Also, you can obtain 100 blunt, froggies and
    regular
    arrows with another red letter. I think that there should be a
    corresponding society agent/stamp for the same kinds of quarrels (i.e.,
    special and elemental). Each weapon is available, including the
    explorer
    yumi for bow archers. Only the archers have an additional two ways to
    obtain ammunition; xbow people, none.&nbsp;
    <p>
    
    Thanks, Maggie. Love the site!!&nbsp;</p>

    Glad you like the site. I see your point about the short shrift Xbow has
    gotten from the Exploration Society. I believe I have an explanation! While
    at the Asheron's Call Player Luncheon (ACPL) in Boston, we heard <a href="http://ac.xrgaming.net/index.php3?library=misc/acpl2" target="_blank">a
    talk by Ken Troop titled &quot;Designing Asheron's Call</a>.&quot; He gave a
    great explanation about why there were no Exploration Society Gauntlets: he
    had, um, forgotten them!! Ta da! I have a feeling the story for the Xbow
    ammunition is the same. Ah well. Crossbow got some nice Quiddity love this
    month, so all is not lost. :)</font></p>

    <p><b>July 31, 2001 - Singularity
    Weapon Quest Correction</b>
    </p>
    <p>Hiya Maggie!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    
    Love your site - use it frequently and have said &quot;hi&quot; to you
    a couple of
    times in-game on TD.
    
    Just wanted to let you know of a minor correction in your Singularity
    Quest description.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    
    You list that the Tattered Virindi Coat is collected from Mosswart
    Mire-Witches - true.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    
    You also list that Mire-Witches can be found at the Versayen Islands -
    also true.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    
    However, the Jungle Island variety of Mire-Witches do NOT drop the
    Cloak.
    Only the South Dires (mainly at Ayan and Weijhou) do. More specifically,
    there are two types of Mire-Witches - a Level 60 and a Level 68 version (the
    only critter I've seen that has the same name yet two different levels). And
    it's the Level 68 version in the South Dires that actually drops the cloak.<br>

    <p><b>July 31, 2001 - A Note About Tibri<br>
    </b>
    <br>
    One additional note on <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Tibri.htm"> Tibri’s Fire
    Spear</a>: Returning Tibri’s Fire Spear to Tibri gains you… nothing. I had done the quest well over a year ago, and I always wondered if
    Tibri gave you a reward for returning her prized fire spear.  I finally got a chance to try it a month or two ago.  She took the spear and didn’t even say “thank you.”  Oh well, it was cool to try.  &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
 I tried another non-quest maneuver. The mnemosyne lore talks about Hamud the assassin:&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <i>“And should I be wrong, should all my hedges and guesses and instincts come to naught, as one day they must, then will my letter go out. It goes to a man who is not quite a man anymore.<br>
    <br>
    Hamud is not the only Isparian who has given over to the Shadows, he is merely the most famous.<br>
    <br>
    And I am sure that this contact of mine will be quite happy to pass along to the Shadows the news that I have to give. The Horror and his assistants have talked much of what their battle plans will be during this upcoming war over the Shadow Lord. They have talked much and in detail. Details which I am sure will be interesting to the Shadow leaders.”  &nbsp;</i><br>
    <br>
 Based on this lore, I took an unlocked small mnemosyne to Hamud in the Mountain Fortress near Qalabar.  He accepted it and didn’t blink, either.  Oh well, I’ve got to keep trying different things.  It keeps the game interesting.  &nbsp;<br>

    <font color="#FFFF80">Hi Karoline -<br>
    First of all, thank you for the generous comments about the site. To answer
    your question, the higher level Summon Portal spells will keep the portal
    open longer than a Summon Portal I spell. This can be important if you're
    opening a portal for a large group to go questing; it takes them a little
    more time for everyone to scoot on through. The description isn't complete
    on my <a href="../../Hobbies/Magic/Item.htm">Item Magic</a> page because I
    couldn't remember the duration for the different levels of the spell. And

    <p>Hi Maggie!<br>
    I can verify that you don't always get plants for your seeds. I was just
    there and turned in my first and only collected seed and I got a message:
    &quot;These are not seeds, but pebbles! You wouldn't know what a seed is if
    it were growing out of your ear!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I was kind of hurt by his/her (had a woman's face &amp; hair, but a man's
    body) harsh words. Anyway, a player that was there told me that you don't
    always get plants...sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't, and
    sometimes she tries to kill you!!! I'll let ya know if that turns out to be
    true.<br>

    So far she has complained to me that I was interrupting her lunch that was
    free of meats, diary ,eggs and cheese and any product from a animal or
    something like that, and she also said I didn't know the difference between
    seeds ands pebbles. If anyone has a clue about seeds with power in

    <p><b>July 31, 2001 - Ned's Controversial View On Hunting Etiquette</b></p>
    <p>Hiya Maggie:<br>
    <br>
    Read your vassal Ned's recent essay, I take issue with several things that
    he had to say about hunting etiquette (we we warned that they were
    controversial), but the one that really poked me in the side was his
    thoughts about the loot timer on a kill.<br>
    <br>
    According to Ned, when we get the kill, we have two choices: loot the kill
    or keep fighting. If we choose to keep fighting and someone else loots the
    kills, that is the way the cookie crumbles. I don't agree with this.<br>
    <br>
    I've got a mid-level sword fighter and had her at the Cit slashing away at
    lugians. Recently I had 4 gigas on me. Now if I play it smart, heal as
    needed, and suck down the stamina potions, I can survive such a situation.
    If the gigas get behind me, or I drop my shield, there is going to be one flat
    Anataki (my sword fighter). I managed to kill of the gigas and was working on the
    other two. Someone else comes up and stands next to me. At first I thought
    he was going to be one of the gentlemen that slaps a couple of heals on me.
    But nope, he starts looting the gigas and then runs off. In this situation,
    I don't think looting was even an option for me if I wanted to live.<br>
    <br>
    I will say that once the monster corpses dissolves, it is fair game on the
    loot.<br>
    <br>
    Take care and cya next week.<br>

    <p><b>July 31, 2001 - A Place For Politeness</b></p>
    <p>Hi Maggie....<br>
    <br>
    Let me start off by saying I love your page :)<br>
    <br>
    I just wanted to mention that I just read Ned's last tip, and I don't
    necessarily agree. When I first went to BSD (level 35 or so), I
    couldn't
    hit a darn thing. Quite depressing (and pretty scary). Finally I
    had a
    Tusker slave cornered, and slapped away at it for about 5 real time minutes,
    and it had about 10 hps left. I was at full health, and was obviously
    going
    to be able to finish the mob off in short order. Then a mage wandered
    by
    (albeit safely behind a wall), and drained it for the last few hp.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
   
    Yes, I got just about all of the xp. Yes, I did get looting rights.
    But I
    also think it was very rude. I got my xp, but was my sense of
    satisfaction
    of a job well done was lessened. I obviously didn't need any help: the
    other char might have gotten at most about 1k xp from his joining the fight
    at the very last second.
    
    Yup, this is only a game. But I still think being polite should still
    hold
    true in the make believe world of AC.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> I mudd'd for many years, and we
    never
    seemed to have this kind of problem. Probably because instead of
    thousands
    of players on at once, you'd only have 100. It was a closer knit
    community,
    and there were more serious social consequences for similar behavior.
    
    This behavior is rampant in BSD, and I've grown to accept it. Mages,
    melee, archers, it's a killing frenzy on the poor gorillas. Heck, I've
    pretty much given up and joined in. But I am glad, though, that this
    behavior
    is mostly absent in Linvak Tukal, another high spawn, high xp area (though
    less than BSD). 90% of the people will run by the monster I'm fighting
    to
    find one of their very own.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    I agree with Ned in terms of looting kills and such: you snooze, you lose.
    But I think there's still a place for politeness in AC :)&nbsp;</p>

    lots of places to hunt, and lots of different types of dungeons and hunting
    areas. A little something for everyone. One thing I've always found to be
    true is that when people are bugging me in-game and acting in ways I don't
    like, I've always been able to find a new location to hunt undisturbed.</font>

    The Niffis Shells, like the Ursuin Fang, must be given to a Leather Crafter.
    Weird, but true. It actually was listed correctly on the <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Crafters.htm">Crafters
    &amp; Collectors</a> page, but it was confusing. Since certain items can be
    given to more than one type of Crafter/Collector, I used the left most
    column to list which types take which items. Unfortunately, people weren't
    noticing that there could be more than one.&nbsp;</font>

    <p><font color="#FFFF80">I posted a warning at the top of the page, after
    receiving a letter or two like yours, asking people to please note which
    type Crafter the item should go to. But since I'm receiving your letter <i>after</i>
    the posting of the warning, I was forced to conclude that it was <i>still </i>confusing.
    Therefore, I have revamped the page and moved the shells and fang up into
    the Hides section, where the rest of the leather crafted items are. I'm
    sorry you lost your shell because of my poor design decision! I hope you can
    forgive me. :)</font>

    </p>
    <p><br>
    Well I was in AB tanking some drudge ravs... Well, I was hittin em' pretty
    good and workin on the second one. Then I lagged out fighting them... I
    relogged and found myself at the LS. NO VITAE!! Obsidian dagger gone. Item
    IV orb with extremely low diff gone. I looked in the inventory. The hot keys
    for the dagger and orb were still toggled but greyed out with no item in
    them.&nbsp;
    
    </p>
    <p>So, I relogged thinking they will reappear. That didn't happen! So, I went to
    AB where I was tanking the drudges. No body. I talked with my patron and he
    said forget about it. But, I didn't give up just yet. I invested a lil over
    an
    hour looking for a body that might not exist. FINALLY, I found it so far
    away that it was impossible for the lag to last that long and for me to log
    back in... What was that all about? Well, one thing I am very thankful of is still having my Obsidian
    Dagger. . . . .
    Just&nbsp; a lil experience I wanted to share with everyone so don't panic if
    it
    happens to you.

    Something very similar to this happened to me before! I was in the hub, and
    my system locked up, so I had to reboot and log back in the game. When I
    came back on, I was at the lifestone, but sadly, I did have vitae. I was
    confused and disoriented and wondering where the heck my body could be. I
    went back to the hub, looked up and down the stairs, looked outside just in
    case I had been sucked out the surface portal. No body anywhere!! I
    eventually gave up, but I was sad because I had lost some of my favorite
    loot.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    After I had given up all hope, I suddenly got a tell from someone who asked
    me if I had found my body yet! He was nice enough to lead me to my corpse,
    which was in some out of the way room in the Abandoned Mines -- far away
    from where I had been. I *never* would have found it and I still don't have
    a clue how it got there. I had the same reaction that you did. What was that
    all about? Anyway, I was glad to have my stuff back and I'm glad to hear you
    got your Dagger back.</font>

    Hi, Maggie!<br>
    <br>
    I absolutely =love= your website, and thank you (profusely)
    for your comprehensive tables of dungeons, landmarks, portals, towns, etc.&nbsp;
    What
    a tremendous asset to AC gamers!<br>
    <br>
    One thing I'd like to ask you to change on your
    website: on the Map section, you offer the tip to use the &quot;@squelch&quot; command to
    eliminate the annoying spellcasting chatter of mages around you. Please, consider
    instead using the command &quot;@filter spellcasting&quot;. This will allow
    mages to talk to you but keep you from hearing them casting spells. It makes mages much
    less annoying to be around! Save the &quot;@squelch&quot; command for
    shutting out people who offend you outright.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for all of your effort in making and keeping your website. I intend to tell all my AC friends about it!<br>

    here and clicking there and realized that the whole section needed some
    major attention. I am sure the @squelch suggestion was a remnant from way
    back when too, before the filtering options were even available! When I

    <p><b>July 3, 2001 - Lyceum Training Grounds (*spoilers*) </b>
    </p>
    <div>
      Maggie:
    </div>
    <div>
       
    </div>
    <div>
      I hope you are well. Indeed it has been a while since we last
      corresponded, so I send greetings and a bit of news.
    
      <p>My second trip to the Lyceum was a success. Unfortunately the time
      warps and lost adventuring time we experienced at the start of this
      season resulted in my Mage Armor top being lost as our world was
      cleansed.   And so today I set off for my third run through the
      Lyceum.  I have struggled to determine if I should even share this
      with you, for any emerging mage may consider that the secrets of the
      Lyceum are just that.  Secrets. A training area.  A place to
      prove your skills.  Indeed, you may recall my first trip was not a
      success -- the third Threshold, indeed the very last golem, broke me. 
      Any mage seriously wanting to pass the trials and become a full member of
      the Heiromancer's Guild should not read, but then the training ground is
      truly a trap for those with blade and arrow, so perhaps these words will
      help satisfy their curiosities and save an adventurer or two.
    
      <p>As you have well described for your pupils, one should enter the Lyceum
      Training area by way of the Humming Crystal portal, use an acid-cleansed
      key on the humming crystal and break open the recall gem after stocking up
      on supplies.
   
      <p>Do spend some good time with Eaushi the training golem, he can help all
      who enter. Indeed, today he welcomed me and yet again rewarded me with a
      Globe of Auberean.
    
      <p>Grab a slip of paper from the upstairs room and hand it to Eaushi. He will
      deliver a portal to you and a present you with a decision.  Three
      thresholds present challenges for the mage and promise death for
      anyone without war magic.  I experimented thoroughly this afternoon
      with my war magic ranging from 258 to 308 and have concluded that the
      First set of golems needs about a 250 war magic skill for success, the
      middle ones 270, and the largest ones approximately 290 skill.  Those
      last ones must have 600 health!
    
      <p>Each training area is shaped and sized similarly.  Go slowly, explore
      the basement and clear the path to the exit portal first.  Use the
      ramp back up from the portal area and you will likely have the attention
      of the golem on the upper level -- this is a good thing, as they are very
      difficult to see -- they are but a vapor!  Fortunately, gas, when
      frozen quickly, will shatter into a shapeless puddle.
   
      <p>Cautiously enter the last slope and the bed of the leader.  He will
      reward you with a stone, but his sleeping area is well guarded!  Any
      student of The Shendolain Vestibule and its see-through golems will know
      what sort of environmental effects to expect.
   
      <p>For bonus points all students should take on the guardian golems. 
      They appear to be diamond golems with particular job titles; one will
      drop a key.  Also be sure of your footing if you wander up the hill. 
      A friend shared last week of his death as he slipped off the slopes
      leading up to the lighthouse.
    
      <p>I hope you're doing well. My magics have progressed quickly with the
      advent of the level 7 spells. It was good seeing you at the Essence.
    
      <p>May your spellbook grow strong!

    This item cannot be placed on the ground nor can it be given to another

    items in possession at time of death. I have dropped mine twice now. It is

        Just thought I'd give you a heads up on the Baron's Amulet Quest, so that you might check it out for yourself to verify.  I completed it shortly after the last patch, and the timing seems to have been adjusted on all of the spawns inside the dungeon.  It did not occur to me to check the spawn rate outside..<br>
        <br>
        1.  The Undead Minor (Scratched Key) spawns every 5 minutes now (instead of the original 15 minutes).<br>
        <br>
        2.  Chest containing Treasure Chest Key spawns/locks every 2 minutes (instead of the original 30 minutes).<br>
        <br>
        3.  Treasure Chest spawns/locks every 5 minutes now (instead of the original 10 minutes).<br>
        <br>
        You can still only pick up one Treasure Chest Key.  Attempting to collect a second key will give you the "You solved this quest too recently" message.  I can also only assume that the quest timer is still 24 hours.<br>
        <br>
