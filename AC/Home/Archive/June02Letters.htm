    <br>
    You probably already know this, but just in case no one has noticed it with 
    all the new quests, the elementals are out and about in lower level areas. I 
    took my vassal out to a place near Hebian where I trained when I was lower 
    level, like ten or so. Well, we're doing fine, until we get to Golems. I 
    barely manage to heal my vassal in time, because I'm an idiot and am nearly 
    out of mana. Well, before you know it, I i.d. a creature I've never heard of 
    before... what the heck's a Mox, I think. I look at it, level 56! Here?!? I 
    must have been standing too close, or maybe I ran up to see what the heck it 
    was, but I had forgotten that I'm running around with all my mana consuming 
    items off... and without the right quarrels.... So, of course I died.<br>
    <br>
    I came 
    back with lightning quarrels, ready for that darned Mox, and couldn't find 
    it anywhere. (That Mox must like peek-a-boo.) Later, that same day, I'm 
    taking my vassal up to the Mossy Fort in Hebian-to, and right there in front 
    is a scintilla, which I kill with slashing (didn't have acid quarrels with 
    me). Ok, today I try to take my vassal to the Zombie House in Hebian-to, and 
    well, I'm off course a little bit... (anyone who knows me knows I'm 
    directionally challenged). Right there is a nice Scintilla with a 
    little lightning elemental with it. I think it was called Static or 
    something similar. <br>
    <br>
    So, if you've already read any other accounts of these surprise party 
    elementals, that's all good and fine, you can disregard my letter :). If 
    not, feel free to edit as you see 
    fit. After all, you're awesome.<br>

    they had read on my site how much I liked it. I still have every

    As a long time fan of your site, I had always thought it would be neat if I 
    could help your site out in some way. I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it 
    was intended, but medium-grade ore refined is no longer 50 burden. When

    the Fathomless Chasm<br>
    </b></span><br>
    Pcmorris here again. Well, being the action-starved quester that I am, I 
    brought my friend, Muten Roshisama, with my archer, Morris the Haze, to the 
    Devex level of the Fathomless Chasm (we did the whole quest in several hours 
    with nothing but 2 l<span lang="en-us">e</span>v<span lang="en-us">e</span>l 29's). Your previous informant probably saw more than 
    I did, as I didn't see any <span lang="en-us">F</span>rosts until I hit the only real jump in the 
    entire dungeon. The place was child's play until we hit the jump. The Frosts 
    and Shivvers like to buff themselves with Fire protection, so my fire arrows 
    did a bit less damage to them whenever one of them buffed, but I simply 
    switched to some frog crotch arrows I was carrying (all arrows are greater 
    only, I didn't manage to hit 230 bow before becoming dangerously close to 
    being too high).<br>
    <br>
    The last section came up pretty unexpectedly (I was expecting the place to 
    be quicker than Clough, but not this much quicker), and we came upon the 
    main Frosts a little unexpectedly. We were pushed back twice to the main 
    drop (it's a much bigger room than the one you get in Clough), but managed 
    to clear them all. When the time came to meet the main golem, I realized I 
    forgot to ask for a focus buff or a monster attunement buff... oh well, at 
    least I got the golem<span lang="en-us">'</span>s name and level.<br>
    <br>
    The sad part of this whole trip was the boss... The Glacial Golem Margrave, 
    a level 42 golem. I ran up and tried to ID it with no luck. Muten landed an 
    imperil on it... it walked toward him... I turned... fired a single greater 
    fire arrow into it's back... and... watched as this golem, who we had spent 
    5-6 minutes trying to clear dozens of frosts to reach... dropped like a sack 
    of potatoes in a matter of seconds... from just the one arrow.... I didn't 
    find out how much health it had, but after being imperiled, a level 29 
    archer, using greater fire arrows and buffed with level VII's, dropped it in 
    a single shot.<br>
    <br>
    I know, the place is supposed to be a lot easier than Clough, but mercy... 
    that was so anti-climatic that I still can't get over it...<span lang="en-us">.<br>
    </span><br>
    I really would like to go back down and get his stats for you, but... having 
    Muten help to clear all those Frosts and getting nothing else for the effort 
    seems like such a waste... although if anyone 'else' was with me to pick up 
    'their' decanters, I'd jump right on it. I really don't think it'd be very 
    healthy for me to try soloing the dungeon. I would likely be killed by the 
    frosts before I could get close enough to Margrave for the ID'ing shots (but 
    apparently I'll have no problem running up to him and wiping the floor with 
    him to clean them out).<br>

    Absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed! I get asked this numerous times a 
    week. Since I haven't addressed the question since February, I figured it 
    was time to drag it out onto the Letters page again. Previously, I said I 
    wanted to actually *play* the game before deciding, because, you know, I 
    need to *like* the game to be willing to devote a chunk of my free time to a 
    second web site! ;-) However, I fully expect AC2 to be just as fabulously 
    wonderful as AC has been, so I have been giving it some serious thought. <br>
    <br>
    At this point, I fully intend to do a site for AC2 as well, but other than 
    formulating some ideas, I've haven't really started work on one yet. I don't 
    see the need to be one of a gajillion sites re-posting the same news that 
    every other AC2 site and their brother is posting at this point. When I do 
    get an AC2 site up and running, I will be looking for people to help me keep 
    it regularly updated. I expect trying to keep 2 sites current will be more 
    than I can handle alone! </span></font></p>

    I sorta feel sorry for the guy. So I came up to him and had a nice chat with 
    him. Several players tried to kill Martine, but they didn't even have a 
    chance before Martine one shot them all to the lifestone. Afterwords, 
    Martine said he was glad to have such respect from an Isparian. He gave me a 
    small shard, but then said, &quot;I beli<span lang="en-us">e</span>ve you have overstayed your welcome

    Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    After all these months of using your site I decided it was time to drop you 
    a note of thanks. You are the standard, as far as I'm concerned, the first 
    place I go with AC questions. And not only do you have the most useful info, 
    but you are far and away the best designed of any AC site. I am a web 
    developer myself so I know how time consuming this sort of thing is, and we 
    really, really appreciate all your hard work.<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

    Just a quick note to say, &quot;Thank You&quot;, for all the work you've done on this 
    site. My Monarch and Patron referred me to your site in August of '01, when 
    I first started playing. Many a time I've used information you've provided 
    and organized to enhance my in game experience. I hope you continue to play 
    AC and to provide information on this wonderful (dare I say, truly 
    &quot;kick-ass&quot;?) site, for all of us who rely on your information to assist us 
    with <span lang="en-us">our </span>game play.<br>
    <br>
    Again, Thank You, Maggie, for all the work you've done to make my AC 
    experience more delightful.</p>

    <br>
    I heard they sent out the first wave of Beta invitations on the 25th. 
    No-one I know has got in, but even if they had, they couldn't tell me any 
    more than &quot;I got in!&quot; (confidentiality rules, y'see.) Still, I was thinking 
    how cool it would be to know that, say, *my* patron or *my* monarch had been 
    invited - you know, sort of a status boost :P <span lang="en-us">A</span>nyway, it suddenly occurred 
    (sp?) to me - NO beta would be complete w/out the Jackcat! If the Devs 
    weren't smart enough to invite you, random lists or not, then they should be 
    fired, for the good of AC2! :D So... just so I know whether or not to picket 
    Turbine or not, you understand... did'ja get in? huh? huh, did'ja? well?<br>
    <br>
    :D<br>
    <br>
    (<span lang="en-us">I</span>t would be cool if we could all say that *our* Maggie the Jackcat got in

    Sadly, no. I did not get my invite. WAAAAHHHH!!! :) But I am in TOTAL 
    agreement with you! That *would* be cool! They DO need me. After all, my 
    site is just full of [sic]'s. I know my its from my it's, and raiment from 
    rainment, and my &quot;this item needs a use string&quot;. They NEED me! Plus, for the 
    last 6 months, I've been sending, by email, a &quot;daily suck-up&quot; to the Devs, 
    with a cc to Ken Karl, praising their unparalleled coding ability, their 
    daring vision, artistic integrity, good manners and their personal hygiene. 
    You'd think, after all, that they'd jump at the chance to have all that free
