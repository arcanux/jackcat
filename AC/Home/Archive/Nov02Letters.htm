        You can get money the old fashioned way: by hunting and selling your 
        loot! As anyone who has ever played with me for any length of time 
        knows, I have what is commonly referred to as &quot;waddle-butt syndrome.&quot; I 
        simply can't hunt without checking every single last monster corpse for 
        loot. And I pick up a lot of it! I can't help myself. Junk that other 
        players reject, I'll squirrel away in my pack. Of course it means that 
        I'm constantly overburdened, but I support myself quite easily. Good 
        luck! I'm glad you like the site!</span></font></p>

        I'm sorry to tell you, but there really is no easy way to identify which 
        complexes have available apartments. I think a site like the Vault with 
        their active server boards might be a more appropriate place for people 
        to post openings, rather than my site. Good luck in your search. I hope

        <br>
        Is it just me, or was Turbine having some, err... lets just say 
        &quot;problems&quot; when they made the new Aluvian mask. The mask has good stats 
        including minor dagger. Now my brother found a Virindi Profatrix Mask 
        and is a Bow/Mage (I think you published one of his letters, his name is 
        Shadow Rising) who wants to think he is good with a dagger. He went out 
        and turned his mask in to Alexander the Deft and received what I think 
        looks like a deformed clown. Now this may just be me but I liked the old 
        Pywll's Guard much more than the new one. The other new racial masks are 
        nice, and I especially like the robot look on the new veil, but the once 
        proud Pwyll's mask is now a joke. I just thought I'd let everyone know 
        that they should see what their getting before they get it. By the way 
        keep up the good work!<br>

        <i>Sic</i> is Latin for &quot;thus&quot; or &quot;so.&quot; When it appears in brackets 
        [sic] it indicates that quoted material is being precisely reproduced. 
        Usually it is used when the quoted material has an error in the 
        original. In other words, when you see [sic], it's my way of saying, 
        &quot;No, that's not a typo, Turbine spelled it wrong.&quot; or &quot;Yes, I know it 
        should be 'its' but Turbine, once again, is using 'it's' instead.&quot; You

        Hiya Maggs!<br>
        <br>
        Don't know if anyone else has showed you this, but while I was doing a 
        little holiday shopping for those on my &quot;nice&quot; list down at the Tusker 
        Emporium, I happened to notice something interesting. The Emporium's 
        proprietor is none other that Sultan of Shysters, that King of 
        Conmen....Ketnan! (I guess the heat was on with the rebuilding in Arwic 
        and the Better Business Bureau told him to take a hike!)<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for all the awesome stuff you do!<br>

        Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Under the updated information about Harlune, you have posted the 
        following:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;A report from Archui: All the talking to him [Harlune] in the world 
        wouldn't elicit A Crabbed Note. from him, so I decided to re-do the 
        Impious Staff quest. The new version looks *really* nice :) But still no 
        Crabbed Note.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        This is a mistake. All the talking in the world WILL get you the Crabbed 
        Note. It just takes more talking than it used to. Must be because he is 
        a snooty Empyrean now.<br>
        <br>
        As always, I love your site and would be lost without it.<br>

        <p>HI Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        I was wondering, Do you think Ned will move out of BSD now that there is 
        a tusker only island?<br>

        Well, that's certainly the question that was on many people's minds. 
        Just how did Ned Cleversun react to this Tusker patch, his gift from the 
        Devs? You can find out the answer to the question right

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Ms. Jackcat,<br>
        I noticed your site hasn't been updated in a very long time. I was just 
        wondering if you still intend on playing AC2 (if you ever did, but since 
        you made a site and all...) and if you would mind notifying the public 
        of your decision.<br>
        <br>
        If you DO play... I must request that you come back to Thistledown, 
        since I know I will miss seeing a real celebrity on my home server (Mithan 
        doesn't count ;).<br>

        <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Dengar -<br>
        Hee hee. I haven't even officially launched my AC2 site, </font>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.derethliving.com">
        <font color="#FFFF99">Dereth Living</font></a><font color="#FFFF99">, 
        and already, the demands are pouring in for me to update it!! ;-) Since 
        I'm still receiving way too many questions about the site, I'll mention 
        it again here on the letter page. Yes, I plan to play and do an AC2 
        site. I stopped working on it because my system kept crashing during 
        Beta (once I <i>finally</i> got in the beta) so I couldn't play. And 
        when I did get on, I had some, er... serious vitae issues. So I put 
        major content updating on hold until retail. </font></font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">And 
        yes, I will continue to play and to update my AC1 site even after AC2 
        comes out.</font></span></p>

        P.S. I promise not to tell Mithan you said that. ;-) </font></span></p>
