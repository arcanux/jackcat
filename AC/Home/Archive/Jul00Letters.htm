      <br>
      It was the end of a long night of toil and trouble in AC -- the night of the July 11 patch. I spent the evening trying to stay alive (very
      uneven success) and carefully testing the creatures around Teth for changes.<br>
      <br>
      I checked your site just now, and ...I am amazed! Good grief, you have LOTS of info.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I know it looks bad to have me (I am your only vassal, after all) spewing immoderate praise, but this effort -- the extensive coverage of new info, thrown together in less than a day -- is outstanding.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      And I was VERY glad to read that the shadows are now transparent. I'm embarrassed to say ...I thought my (very fancy) video card was going haywire.</font></p>

 Thank you so much for thinking I would be a good Patron. I'm very flattered to be asked. However, I'm going to have to decline your generous offer. I've had people ask me in the past and I've always explained to them what limited time I really have to play the game. I'm lucky if I get an hour or two in several times a week. The web site, of course, cuts into actual playing time as well. I think most players would be better served by having a Patron who can spend more time with them in-game.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I've pretty much decided not to take on any more vassals than I currently
      have. <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Ned.htm"> Ned Cleversun</a>, now 17 levels above me, is very indulgent and understanding, as well as fairly self-sufficient and manages fine with a little assistance from other high level players on the server, such as
      <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Danier.htm"> Danier</a>. Again, thank you very much for asking me! I appreciate your offer and hope you understand why I must decline. I'm sure you'll get hooked up with a nice group in no time at all!<br>

      The answer is no, as far as I understand. When we were in Boston for the

      time, Stamina Potions cannot be made because if they were possible, it
      would nerf cooking too much. Makes sense when you think about it.</font></p>

      <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">July 11, 2000 - About the
    Composite Arms...</font></small></strong></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">I have discovered
    the following about Composite Arms. There are four possible arms that one can make. They
    are:</font></small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">1. Fire Auroch Horn + BLUE colored Sinew (regualr or small).
      Shows up as a white horn with grey cuts.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">2. Fire Auroch Horn + Cured Large Sinew. Shows up as a white
      horn with blue cuts.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">3. Mattekar Horn + BLUE colored sinew. Shows up as an orange
      horn with grey cuts.</font></small></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><small>4. Mattekar Horn + Cured Large Sinew. Shows up as an orange
      horn with blue cuts.</small></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">That is what I have found so far. For some reason, the Auroch
    horn shows up as white (?) and the Mattekar horn shows up as orange. The blue sinews
    (regular and small) show up as grey cuts into the horn, and the Large sinews (orange) show
    up as blue cuts into the horn. That is what I have found from pictures and my own
    experience in making composite arms.<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Thanks for sending the info in! I'm still
    working on compiling the stats and the biggest unknown right now is the Melee defense. So
    far, I pretty sure that the type of Horn used for the Arms determines the Melee Bonus. If
    you're correct that there are four types of Arms, and if the Arms follow the pattern of
    the other components, giving three possilbe outcomes (the better of the lesser pari
    equaling the lesser of the better pair), then my best guess at this point is as follows:</small></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>#1 produces +2% melee<br>
      #2 and #3 produce +4% Melee<br>
      #4 produces +6% Melee. </small></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>[Update: It has been
      confirmed that the horns do determine Melee Defense. A Fire Auroch Horn
      (from a Bull only) yields +2% and a Mattekar Horn yields +6%.]</small></font></p>

    As far as I understand, the handle is not removable. Once it's on, it's on. That means

    on. Good luck&nbsp;with it! And when you have it put together, I'd love it if you

    <br>
    <small><font face="Arial">Maggie, your site is an inspiration to me.&nbsp; So many young
    adventurers willingly sacrifice fashion for added protection at the expense of everyone
    else's eysight.&nbsp; I love to see the fashion showcased on your site.<br>
    <br>
    I was wondering if you could help me with a fashion problem I've been having.&nbsp; I'm
    attempting to assemble some outfits, but the shopkeepers keep fooling me!&nbsp; They'll
    show me a nice white pair of pants, but when I buy them and try them on, they look dirty
    and grey!&nbsp; Or they'll show me a nice dark blue hat, but when I buy it and put it on
    it looks purple!&nbsp; I try the clothes on right there in the shop's fitting room, but
    the shopkeeper always insists that I pay up front, and he never lets me exchange my
    clothes for a full refund!&nbsp; I keep the receipt and everything!&nbsp; First they
    misrepresent the color of their clothing and then they won't even give me my money back.
    It's so dishonest!&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I have the same trouble when I find clothes and armor in the dungeons.&nbsp; I dislike
    trying on clothes in the dungeons (no privacy!) so I often end up carrying around hideous
    garments for a long time before I can try them on and see how they look.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    Can you offer me any advice?&nbsp; Do the merchants have some secret color-mapping code
    that I need to know, like &quot;hot pink = purple&quot; or something like that?&nbsp; Is
    there somebody I can report these crooks to?<br>

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>Your complaint is a common one, and one I've
    made myself many a time. I'm afraid there's just no easy answer. Dereth is, in many

    suits me fine, because that means *I* can assume the mantle of authority just as well as
    the next person.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF80"><small>The merchants will not change their ways.
    They'll sell you some green looking leggings and when you get them on they'll be orange.
    Your complaints fall on deaf ears. They'll insist you made a good buy! Your best bet, if
    you're looking for items of a particular hue, is to trade with your fellow players. But if
    you do, be cautious. If you think the shops are full of crooks, just wait 'til you get to
