      <font face="Arial" size="2">Dear Maggie,<br>
      <br>
      I was wondering if you had any confirmed information of the location of
      the new dye plants.&nbsp; I have found the white plants in both the
      northern and southern mountains, the blue along the beaches, but I cannot
      find the greens.&nbsp; I was told they are on the newest islands but I ran
      around like crazy for several hours and didn't find even one.&nbsp; Just
      hoping to get a confirmation that is where they are supposed to be (and
      maybe narrow it down a little).<br>
      <br>
      Keep up the great work!!<br>

      the ones who do, aren't telling! ;-) I've heard rumors that they are on
      the lower level Vesayen Isles, but don't have confirmation. Another rumor
      I heard was that you can find them in the mountains near Lin. Yet another,
      in the woods to the west of Bandit Castle. Good luck!</font>

    <br>
    Undeads have been improved. I don't have all the stats but I do know ...
    Liches are now level 30, Undeads are level 15, and Lich Lords are now 55.
    I'm sure the other undeads have changed too, but I have not checked out the
    High Undeads. Hope this was helpful.<br>

      <strong>December 18, 2000<small>- </small> </strong><b>New Spines and SoCS</b></p>
    <p>Hi.&nbsp;<br>
    I was reading your letters page and I had a strange thought.&nbsp; Since the
    Silifi of Crimson Stars can be made with various spines to produce an axe
    with various stats, Have you heard of anyone making it with the new Island
    Dillo Spine? I was wondering if it is possible and if it would make an even
    better axe.</p>
    <p>By the way, Great site.&nbsp; I only wish it had a site index to make
    finding things a bit easier.<br>

    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Hi Sinjin Smythe -</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">I know that last month several people tried, but it
    was not possible to use an Island Spine with the SoCS. This month the build
    notes stated the following:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Kayna bint Isawas now talks a bit about
      the speed vs. damage choice in SoCS armoredillo spines.&quot;</font></i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Although I haven't made it over there yet to see
    what she says differently, I haven't heard anyone mention that the 'Dillo
    spine was added as a choice. I assume the answer is still no.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Thanks for the compliment on the site. I'll
    consider the index idea. I've had lots of people ask for the feature, but as
    always, it's a matter of time constraints. If only I didn't have this pesky
    job! ;-)</font></p>
