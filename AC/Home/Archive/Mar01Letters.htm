    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I love your site!  It's the absolute best one out there.  I saw your recent letter
    on death items and knew I had seen how they are determined and just HAD to find the info.  After many fruitless searches, I finally hit
    upon the site that has the straight dope on Death Items.  Here's a link for you to post:<br>

    Thanks very much for the link! And thank you for the compliment on the site.
    I read the article and was reminded of the waaaaay early days, when pyreal
    was precious, and we first went through the process of deciding whether
    trade notes were a good deal or not. Was losing that 10% a good trade off
    for that low burden and the not-lose-on-death thing? Seems almost unreal
    now. :)</font>

    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    Just wanted to let you know that ever since I more or less accidentally stumbled across your pages last week, I've been completely hooked. Haven't
    had such a great time looking at anybody's pages for a veeeeery long time. A couple of times I was thinking I might need some medical attention due to
    acute respiratory problems caused by a laughter-induced-but-hopefully-
    not-brain-damaging-lack-of-oxygen.<br>
    <br>
 I have only been playing for a couple of weeks now and I have, thankfully, only encountered a few - ahhhm, how shall
    I put it? -- nasty people so far. Most of the people I've met have been very nice indeed, but encountering
    someone who will go to incredible lengths just to rip you off can be an off-putting experience. Knowing there's people like you out there, though,
    trying to help and share the huge amounts of fun they're obviously having with everybody else makes the game worthwhile. So, thank you for your
    pages.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
 Seriously.

    You're welcome. Thanks for writing. I'm glad you enjoy the site! It's a lot

    Overall, I think the AC Community is fantastic. I've only been
    &quot;stolen&quot; from one time, when I was careless while muling. It was
    terrible and anger making. He had taken my purple yoroi leggings!! *sniff*</font>

      </p>
    <p>Well one beautiful afternoon I was wandering the streets of Holtburg
    hopelessly. Well then I had an idea! I would travel to Glenden woods to
    visit my friends who like live there. I was about a few miles outside of
    Holt on my way to GW when I got an itchy trigger finger for war magic. hehe.
    I spotted a useless old drudge but I decided to kill him, he was in front of
    a store on the side of the road. I wasted him in a single blow but I
    happened to notice that the door was open. I went in all I saw was a corpse
    rotting on the ground. I clicked on the corpse but nothing happened. Outside
    the hut was a part of the roof! Not joking, weird things can happen. My
    friend told me that some day major towns will be no longer than ruins. I
    just wanted to know if dead shop keepers ever came back to life. Thanx!

      </p>
        <p>I vas of mine who currently hunts the Hall of Helm sent me a tell one
        day that he had been killed in the Moss Chamber in Zak and said he would
        need help. I replied you're kidding right? (As that place WAS a joke.)
        He said no that he had been hit for 35 point of fire damage before he
        even exited the portal and was dead before he barely even had a chance
        to turn and run.<br>
        <br>
        I went there with fully buffs &quot;Just In Case&quot; and sure enough
        there was a moss something or nother wielding a big nasty flame sword
        who I sent screaming home. Once my vas had collect his body I decided to
        explore. I managed to get to what I believe in the end was a Moss Witch
        and a Gragghk (Which I had never even seen!)&nbsp;
      </p>
        <p>I finshed the Witch off and the Gragghk decided at this point he
        wanted a part of me and sent me screaming to the life stone in one hit.
        :( I went back in and got jumped by 3 mosses this time and a debuff
        latter was back at the Life Stone. :( :(
      </p>
        <p>Called in some friends and we cleared this place all the way back
        down to the Gragghk and I saw a portal that I believe went to a deeper
        Moss Chamber. The area we had come to with the Gragghk did not appear to
        be the end. Just for your info... :)<br>

        You may recall me mentioning that it would be nice to have links to the
        server updates under the archived new stuff links. You mentioned that
        these pages where under Culture, and then <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm">Dereth
        History</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Well, I went there and didn't find any of the info on the patches. In other words, there is just text and no screenshots, things like that.<br>
        <br>
        For instance look at the difference between<br>
        <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Lonely2.htm">http://www.thejackcat.com/AC/Culture/Dereth/Lonely2.htm</a>

        <br>
        Lonely2.htm is the page I'm looking for not Lonely.htm.<br>
        <br>
        So what I suggest is placing links to the &quot;Patch Pages&quot; like<br>

        below the links to<br>

        This way I and others looking for these pages will be able to find them.

        I actually think the New Stuff page is already a little overcrowded.
        What I did instead was replace the links on the Dereth History page with
        links to the Patch Pages, instead of linking to the page which has the

      2001 - </b><b>Charges Laid Against The Jack Cat</b>
      </p>
    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I now present before you the Case of Maggie The Jack Cat.
    As all of you know, Maggie The Jack Cat has a fabulous Asheron's Call website.
    Charges are laid against Maggie The Jack Cat for catalyzing an already dangerously addictive game to a degree unheard of.<br>
    <br>
    The Prosecution:<br>
    *You're hopeless.  You couldn't push over a brown bunny.  Desert bunnies give you nightmare.  Spell? You don't even know how to speak properly.  You're heading for the nearest Shadow spire to come crashing down to your oblivion.  On the way down, you capture the view.  You're telling yourself, Hey, probably Maggie could use this one.  Bam... there you go... looking for terrible deaths all over Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    *The idea of spilling (un)living blood all over the landscape revolts you.  You heave a sigh of relief, that finally you can let go of that AC game.  Wrong.  Bammm.  Here comes Maggie with her chocolate cake, Holtburger and Ice cream
    recipes.<br>
    <br>
    *You've been wiped out.  Your corpses litter the Direlands.  You freeze you tush off whenever there's a breeze as you have nothing left.  Ahhh, freedom from the addiction.  As you're heading back to town, you stumble
    across an apple orchard.  Whammm... Maggie can tell you where to get yourself
    stinking rich with these meager apples.<br>
    <br>
    *You've mastered all the beasts Dereth can throw at you with two hands tied behind your back.  Finally, you can hang up that Katar.  Crash... here comes the newest quest from Maggie.<br>
    <br>
    *You've tried every type of Hero.  You've got mana coming out of your ears.  Crunch...
    Have you tried Maggie's Extreme template?<br>
    <br>
    *You get lost coming out of your pajamas, let's not even consider knowing how portals work.  Splash... Here's Maggie's World Wide Maps.<br>
    <br>
    See that amount of unnecessarily added addiction Maggie lathers all over the place?  Prosecution rests.<br>
    <br>
    The Defense:<br>
    Errrr... he's right Your Honor.<br>
    <br>
    The Verdict:<br>
    Maggie's Asheron's Call Kick-Ass Fabulous Web site is even more than that.  She contributes hours upon hours of scheming, planning and
    reflection upon a game that already eats up more than its fair share of (un)conscious hours.<br>
    <br>
    One thing to say:<br>
    It's one Kick-Ass Fabulous web site.<br>

    When people refer to Death Items, they usually mean items of high value that
    they carry hoping those items will be selected to be lost, instead of their
    regular, crucial every-day armor &amp; weapons. I don't remember exactly how
    death items are calculated, but the higher your level, the more items you
    will lose. Items are also categorized (weapons, items, armors, etc.) and
    you'll tend to lose one of the highest valued items from the different
    categories.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Mage Master Robes are popular death items because
    they are lightweight and they are a very high value. Plus they are easily
    replaceable. The new Recall Gems to the Master Robe Archmages are also good
    death items for the same reasons. Some people carry useless (to them) pieces
    of armor with absurdly high values (nearly flawless pyreal greaves with
    Strength VI, Coor VI, Imp VI, Rank 8+ -- value: 46,974p) or pieces of
    jewelry, or some outrageously expensive footwear, like <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Sara.htm">Sara

    I was given a bag of C notes with explicit instructions that I wasn't
    allowed to go on any more quests which involved jumping and
    nearly-impossible recovery areas without a good selection of death items.
    (Thanks Danier! ;-) I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank Laurianna and her fine

      </p>
        <p>Hey Maggie,&nbsp;<br>
        I love the site, but I've got one question. While perusing your site I
        noticed a section called 'Peas', filled with pictures and descriptions
        of items like the Pyreal Pea and the Taper Pea. I hate to be the noobie,
        but what's a Pea for? And what's it do? Maybe you could toss an
        explanation at the top of that page. That'd be great :)
      </p>
        <p>On a side note, I'm tied in Bandit Castle and can get you the rates
        of the merchants, if you need them. Just tell me what you need :)
      </p>
        <p>Also, I had an item on a mule of mine a while back. I got it in Stone
        Cathedral, I believe; that dungeon by Shoushi West Outpost (1-5).
        Anyway, it was &quot;Finely Aged Cider&quot;, and wasn't droppable.
        Needless to say I deleted that mule, so I don't know its 'flavor text',
        but I found it odd. It's also not on your Food Bargains page. It had the
        same icon as Grape Juice.

        Thanks very much for the offer of the Bandit Castle rates. I would have
        loved to have taken you up on it, but I had already made the run up
        there myself! I loved your suggestion about an explanation of what peas
        are and wrote one up on the <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains/Peas.htm">Peas</a>
        bargain page. I've been getting a lot of newbie questions lately, and
        sometimes forget that what seems so obvious to me isn't obvious to
        people who haven't been playing a while.</font>

        <p><font color="#FFFF80">The Cider is also a newbie item. It's part of
        the Shoushi Starter Quests. Nen Ai needs it for her sickly pet drudge.
        You can find more information <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Shoushi.htm">here</a>.
        Thanks again!</font>

        Do i need arcane lore to use the Ring of Endurance. I am specialized in

        <font color="#FFFF80">Hi Latimus -<br>
        You don't have to be specialized or trained in Arcane Lore to use the
        items, but you do need an Arcane Lore of 15. The Difficulty of the item
        is the required Arcane Lore to activate the item's spells. If you don't
        have Arcane Lore trained or specialized, you cannot add points directly
        to the skill. However, you can raise it by putting points into Focus. If
        you put your mouse over any skill, you'll see the formula appear in the
        top left of your screen. The Arcane Lore skill is calculated by Focus
        divided by 3. So for every three points of Focus you raise, your Arcane
        Lore skill will raise by 1. I hope that helps!</font>

    Hey Maggie,<br>
    Just wanted to say that the PK story is a perfect example of why I like your
    site so much. Everyone has formulas and coords, but only you take the time
    to show the world that this game might actually be fun. Those crazy Ned
    Cleversun stories always make me laugh. Keep up the great work!<br>

    <p>Dear Maggie,&nbsp;<br>
    First, I love your site. It is a wonderful resource. Anyway, I have recently
    learned that on the Frostfell server at least, Advocates and Sentinels have
    been removed from the game. I don't know if this occurred on other servers,
    but you may want to update that fact on your site :)<br>

    Thanks very much for the reminder. I've updated the <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/advocates.htm">Advocate
    &amp; Sentinels</a> page with a note about them being replaced by paid
    employees. I also provided a link on the page to Asheron's Helpers where
    many of the former team have gathered to continue providing assistance in
    Dereth on a less formal basis! Thanks very much, also, for the compliments
    on the site! I'm glad you like it!</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie<br>
        <br>
        I really like your site, so please, keep the great work up. I am a
        quest-junkie, just love it. Now to the point of this mail...<br>
        <br>
        I recently completed the Dagger of Tikola quest, and I have some
        information if you would care to update it. The NPC who asks for a
        Parchment is Felscuda. If you give a Parchment to her, she will give you
        info about the quest: you are supposed to give Lady Folthid a Wood Heart
        from a Golem; the dagger is no-give; and she tell you a little about the
        dungeon. The Aste and the Se Sclavus in the bottom of the dungeon are on
        10 minute spawns. The Aste has a dagger each spawn, and the quest is not
        on a timer. You can camp it and get as many daggers you want.<br>

        Hi Aethelgrin&nbsp; -<br>
        Thanks for the information on the Dagger of Tikola. Updating some of the
        older quests has been &quot;on the list&quot; for a while now! I finally
        did an upgrade to <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Brogord.htm">Brogord's Axe</a>
        the other day. I'll try to get the great information you sent posted
        soon. It's always a trade-off between updating old pages or putting new
        ones up. I've got a pile of new quests researched and ready to go up;
        it's just a matter of finding the time. I'm glad you like them! More
        coming soon! ;-) Thanks again!</font>
