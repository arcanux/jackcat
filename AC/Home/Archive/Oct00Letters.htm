        and not-so-serious role-players. That's still the intention. Granted, if
        suddenly AC permanently turns into a giant low-cut dress carnival I'll

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi Maggie,<br>
      <br>
      I just wanted to drop off a message of support for you regarding "The Dress."  My personal opinion is that I don't like the dress and no avatar of mine will ever wear it.  I'm willing to let that just be my personal opinion, but apparently that opinion is not allowed to pass unmocked by the CoD community.<br>
      <br>
      I have grown tired of being vilified for not liking the dress, so I've avoided posting about it after the first dev board thread.  Nonetheless, I wanted to reassure you that not all female AC players besides yourself are like those samples on the Discussions board.<br>
      <br>
      My current position is not even asking asking for removal of the dress. Some women want the cartoon images of themselves to look like that, I suppose.  I personally like to think that we've come a long way since the Renaissance, when sewage was thrown into the street. But I digress.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> The facts that:<br>
    A.) Turbine either "sexied up" or "made formalwear for" (depending on who's arguing) ONLY the female avatar;<br>
    B.) there is no room for female players to express dissatisfaction with this "sexiness" or "formalwear" without being ridiculed, thought hostile, or accused of having certain nasty characteristics in real life;<br>
    C.) that the group of people that agitated for this change congratulate themselves at every opportunity for what they see as their support of femininity and engage in such logical fallacies as referring to themselves as a "majority" when they have no statistical grounds to speak from disturb me.<br>
      <br>
      Basically, then, I have not so much a problem with what I see as Turbine's oversight as to keeping the gender content balanced--it would be lovely if they could just tell us that that's what it was--as I do with the truly disheartening responses of the fansite communities of Asheron's Call players. I have rarely seen so much anti-woman and misinformed drivel permitted in a public forum.  While my playing of AC is not at stake here, I do know that CoD will be seeing less of me for at least a while after all this, as I am made rather ill.<br>
      <br>
      That's my side of beef. I'm not even sure anymore how closely it aligns with yours, but I figured that you would give it a fairer shake than the sharks currently circling in posting-land.<br>
      <br>
      With all best wishes,<br>
      Kate&nbsp;<br>
      </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Hi Kate -</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">You letter certainly sums
      up the worst of this discussion. When I initially expressed my
      disappointment over the dress on the Dev Board, I was pretty satisfied
      with the discussion overall, and thought that Sean and I had come to an
      understanding that our positions weren't far apart. I had registered my
      opinion, because I thought it needed to be said, and that was that.&nbsp;I
      thought Turbine needed to know that if they continued to add content that
      sexualized the women only, they were going to lose customers like me.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Then after
      the discussion had died down a bit I was attacked with a sarcastic
      response in a way that I thought was a little bit of &quot;piling on&quot;
      and totally unnecessary. It's pretty much been that way since, with
      over-the-top responses and posts directed at me and others that are, well, irrational
      and uncalled for. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">I'm pretty comfortable
      swimming amongst the sharks, and extremely comfortable being the lone
      dissenting voice in a crowd of jackals. My initial days on the Internet
      were spent arguing in political forums. ;-) However, I realize that many
      people are not. I certainly agree that the current climate on the boards
      is so hostile, that anyone agreeing with a position remotely associated
      with mine -- that adding the dress perhaps showed some poor judgment -- is
      instantly labeled as being &quot;silly,&quot; &quot;emotional,&quot;

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi there. I'm one of the EpiK members,
        and all grievances aside, I still can't agree with you on the dress.
        This is no worse than what Britney Spears, etc, are all wearing to
        prominent events such as the MTV awards, etc. In fact, this is much
        better, and while it does reveal a bit more cleavage than the standard
        dresses, it is by NO means a &quot;bad&quot; dress. If you think this is
        going to somehow affect a 7 year old girl playing AC, then I think you
        are wrong, because she'll have seen Britney Spears and Courtney Love
        wearing worse anyhow.</font>

      that the dresses are &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong.&quot; I have never
      said, nor has anyone else, as far as I know, that I wanted them removed from the game. I <i>have</i> said that I
      dislike them, and I gave specific concrete reasons why. I have also said
      that I thought adding them showed poor judgment, that I was disappointed
      in their addition, and that I thought they looked trashy. If you, or
      others, think they do not look trashy, I certainly can't argue with that.
      Opinions of taste can never be wrong, no matter what some of those folks
      on Lum are saying. If your fiancé wants to wear low cut dresses, more
      power to her. I've been known to expose my own tits a time or two myself.

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hmmm... what to say... the dresses are fine, a bit of cleavage instead of the olive tank top.
      It is unfortunate that this game gets reprimanded for adding a dress to accentuate female characteristics, when the same game gives males no undershirts and instead that
      chiseled chest to show off. As for the codpieces movement, those can be added with the thongs if they ever
      do, though at that point I would be forced to cancel my subscription, as we both know the guys would be wearing both!
      lol!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think the chest hair was added to attempt to keep the guys from wearing it, but even
      I have one next to my Grey Dryreach one (level 36 male Aluvian Blademaster).
      Personally, I'm in for the equal treatment and desire some fancy duds for the men, so that half the male population of
      Dereth are not crossdressing. Crossdressing is fine by me, but it's a little silly when everyone is doing it!
      I want a white suit and a 70s pimp hat with a large red feather sticking
      out. C'mon Turbine!<br>

      </small></strong></font><b>Female Avatars</b></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My first reaction to the news of the red dress was "Someone actually tried to do that, and it worked!" I was amused sat the idea of someone thinking "What if
      we....&quot; I wonder if they tried to do it with Shadow smiths, too.<br>
      <br>
      Next, I acquired one for my female alts. I tried it a bit, noticed the cute detail of the tan lines. I did what every guy around has done when nobody else was looking...try it on my male main. Okay, funny. And then I stashed it away. I decided that only one of my female alts looked right in a dress, and then it was in the grey Yifan robe.<br>
      <br>
      I didn't pay it much mind after that, half expecting some negative over-reactions plus some over-enthusiast opinions being
      slung back and forth on the boards. That was until I found that a couple of known moochers of Eastham had quickly adopted it as working uniform. You know the type... they walk around in their undies, begging for everything you can think of, acting silly and coy and going from group to group of highbies trying to get freebies.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is, they existed before, and they tried the very best they could to use their female avatar condition to get ahead in the game.
      And it seems they did well before.<br>
      <br>
      I remember something that happened to me recently when making my latest character. I tried the character's template using a male avatar first, logged in a newbie town, went to a dungeon, and discovered something was utterly wrong with not having melee defense and being melee without being twinked, no matter how  good the eq or potions. I died three times in a row while the other guy hunting in the dungeon paid me no attention. So, I re-rolled, and this time in a whim I got a female avatar.<br>
      <br>
      ...you guessed it. As soon as I entered the dungeon, the guy who had ignored me completely all of sudden got all helpful and
      cooperative, offered to level me and get me some beginner stuff, and be my patron.<br>
      <br>
      I needed no revealing dress, acting bimbo, or having a cute name. I was a female avatar. That was enough. If you're a gal, I suggest you try playing a male avatar without telling anybody, you'll be surprised how male's attitudes suddenly change.<br>
      <br>
      People brings their attitudes with them into the game. You can't avoid it. The red dress won't spawn a whole new batch of sexism, either in their mildest, more civilized forms (patronizing gallantry) or in their the crudest ones (outright harassing)...it is there already; but it'll make it more obvious.<br>
      <br>
      The red dress may stay if you ask me; I guess real roleplayers will put it to good (or naughty) use. Me, I'm not a roleplayer, I dislike beggars and female avatars that can't stand on their own in the dungeon, keep their word, or give as much as they take given their ability, the things I value in a hunting partner. Even if they wear a red dress. But hey, a female avatar I can call friend isn't going to offend me for wearing one. Quite the contrary. If anything, it'll teach guys playing female avatars what gals have to put up with sometimes.<br>
      <br>
      PS: I'm in the "I want formal parade-style clothing for guys, darn it!" camp. I was also a bit
      disappointed that Sho got Chinese style dresses instead of Japanese, but I guess it was easier to model them. I may not be a rper, but I'm fashion conscious in a way (when it doesn't interfere with the AL of my armour, that is)<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>October 22, 2000 - </strong><b>How
      Do I Take Screenshots?</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I was wondering if you
      could tell me how to capture a screen shot of my character.&nbsp; Thanks
      for your help.</font></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">
      Hi Soul Calibur -<br>
      Sure. Taking screenshots is easy. There's already a key mapped to the function. It's your
      astericks key on your numberpad. Each time you press it, a screenshot will automatically be saved on your hard drive in .bmp format. If you take a bunch of screenshots, they will automatically be numbered for you in order.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To retrieve your screenshots, you need to open your Windows Explorer and find your Asheron's Call folder on your hard drive. That's the folder that was created when you installed the game. More than likely, it will be on your C: drive under Program Files\Microsoft Games. If it's not there, you can use the Find function under Tools to search for it. When you've located the Asheron's Call folder, open it up and you should see your screenshots right there. They will be numbered like this: ACscrn1.bmp, ACscrn2.bmp, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Graphics saved in .bmp format are large files! If you take a lot of screen shots, they will start to eat up space on your hard drive. To make them more
      manageable, and to make them more suitable for posting on the web or emailing to your friends (or sending to CoD as
      <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/daily.shtml" target="_blank"> Fan Pic</a> of the day!!) you should convert the files into .jpg format.<br>
      <br>
      To convert your pictures to .jpg, you'll need a graphics editing program. You can download any number of free ones from Download.com. A popular one is Irfan View. You can get it
      <a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10077-108-38759.html?tag=st.dl.10077.upd.10077-108-38759" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
      [Insert legal disclaimers here!!]<br>
      <br>
      Using Irfan View as an example, open up one of your screenshots in your editing program. To convert to a .jpg, choose "Save As" under the File menu. Make sure the the .jpg extension is selected, THEN (important part) click on your Options Tab to select quality. You'll see some sort of slider bar with 100% being best quality/large file size. The higher the quality, the larger the file size. Personally, I prefer better quality and slightly larger file size than lesser quality/smaller file size. In general, I wouldn't suggest going lower than 70% or higher than 95% when selecting quality, but it's a matter of preference.<br>
      <br>
      Click Save and you're done! You have a nice .jpg file suitable for emailing or posting on the web!
      Don't forget to delete the original .bmps from your hard drive to conserve
      space.</font></p>
