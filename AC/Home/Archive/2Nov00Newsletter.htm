      HAPPY BIRTHDAY!<br>
      -------------------------------------<br>
      I'm not sure what the official date is of the one year anniversary of AC's release, but I figure this is close enough! Let me just say...<br>
      <br>
      Happy Birthday to youuuuu,<br>
      Happy Birthday toooo yooouuuuuuu,<br>
      Happy Biiiiiiiirrrttthhhdaaaaaayyy Dear Tuuuuurrrrbiiiiiiiiiine,<br>
      Happy Birthday tooooo youuuuuuuuuuuu!!<br>
      <br>
      Big thanks to Turbine for the amazing game you've made and for the loads of fun you've given us over the past year (and even longer for some). I still remember that very first time I surfaced from the Tutorial Dungeon. It was *raining* out! I could hardly believe it, it was so cool! I must have taken a million screen shots! I look back on those early pictures and laugh. Yes, I have the obligatory shot of the giant flower. And my first kill (a white rat; they were everywhere in beta). My prized mint green scalemail pauldrons. And about 40 from my first trip to the Tou-Tou lighthouse.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      That was my mission in beta, trying to reach the tip of that land mass, before Tou-Tou officially existed. I can't tell you how many countless times I died, fried by a Gromnie or some other undesirable before I finally made it. It was exhilarating, exploring the vast unchartered land, finally looking out over the ocean from my vantage point far above the earth.<br>
      <br>
      After all this time, I am still amazed at the delight Dereth gives me. I still can't resist snapping a pic of a particularly beautiful sunset, or the moon over Zaikhal. I love the view of Teth as it appears in the distance when I round the bend after a portal recall. I love my sexy yoroi leggings, and my Lavender Jade Long Sword. I still cherish my first good sword, now safely tucked away, my beautiful gold tachi with the BD III -- a Valentine's Day gift from my wonderful vassal, Ned Cleversun.<br>
      <br>
      I still get a thrill when I can begin to solo creatures I could previously only attack with help. The first time I sliced a Lich dead all by myself was a glorious day for me! I like the way the people in AC just seem nicer than in other games I've played, and how the Devs respond to their player base. I even love the random loot generators, down to hunks of cheese and the festive crockery. Really, I just like it all!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I've played other games for extended periods of time and they always seemed to stop being fun after a while. Not with AC! It just seems to get better and better. So thanks again Turbine for this great game! And Happy Birthday on this 1 year anniversary of Asheron's Call!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>

      AC SITES IN THE NEWS!<br>

      Turbine Question and Answer Page<br>
      <a href="http://www.turbinegames.com/qa/" target=_blank>http://www.turbinegames.com/qa/</a><br>
      You've probably heard of it by now, but just in case.... Turbine has created a question and answer page, in lieu of a FAQ, to, well, answer questions about the game! Just another example of their fantastic level of service to their fans. Of course I am totally well-disposed to this idea since my question got answered almost immediately! ;-)<br>
      <br>
      The Unrepentant Archer<br>
      <a href="http://www.pongo.com/brash/" target=_blank>http://www.pongo.com/brash/</a><br>
      I have no idea how long this site's been around, but I only just discovered it. If you play an archer, you really should check this out. Besides its clean, sharp looking design, it has info on Tactics and Strategy, Hunting Areas, Essays, Journals, Interviews, plus links to me! ;-) It's so well-done, it almost makes me want to put aside my sword and pick up a bow!<br>
      <br>
      Bane this, Sucka!<br>
      <a href="http://www.cyberramp.net/~robertp/ac_rap.htm" target=_blank>http://www.cyberramp.net/~robertp/ac_rap.htm</a><br>
      I know this has made the rounds several times, but every time I hear someone mention it, I have to go listen to it again!  It's Xane and Ronu-san's hilarious AC rap song, complete with a scenic graffiti-ized Meeting Hall. "Bane this, Sucka!" was my favorite line of the whole thing.<br>

      MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS SITE NEWS!<br>
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      Thanks to the Zone for mentioning my site in the Annals of Dereth newsletter for both my Pumpkin Carving Guide and my Masks page!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      October also brought the new content that could finally knock the Shadow Armor page off the top of my stats list. That's right. The only thing more popular in October than Shadow Armor was... cleavage!<br>
      <br>
      I've been extra busy at work lately, so haven't had as much time to get up some of the new content I had planned. Thanks to my tour guides, Danier and Vilegoroth, I should have several more quests written up soon. Unfortunately, because I am so jumping impaired, the Atlan Fire Stone will have to wait! As a result of my humiliating display, I got special private jumping lessons inside Artifex Vault and hope to try again soon! :)<br>
      <br>
      I also have another treat in store! As a special feature for AC's 1 year anniversary, I've caught up with a few of the earlier Runway participants. "Where They Are Now" is coming soon! Find out what folks like Pigroast II, Zenk &amp; Danier have been up to since I first put them up on the Runway.  Look for it on Maggie the Jackcat's Kick-Ass Fabulous Web Site soon! (I know; famous last words! :) The Runway should also have some new additions in the near future as well.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      See you in the game!<br>
