      BOSTON PLAYER LUNCHEON<br>
      ------------------------------------------------<br>
      As many of you know, I began my vacation with the AC Player Luncheon in Boston! For those of you who couldn't make it, I've done a little (actually, it's, um, wordy :) write-up of the event on my website. You can find it here. You can also see the bundle of love I deposited on the
      <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank"> CoD</a> site -- photos of the event, offered as a token of my great esteem and affection.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I know I speak for so many of us when I say thank you to Allen Grey of <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank"> CoD</a> who did an absolutely fabulous job of organizing the event. He is simply amazing. And another big thank you to
      <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Az.htm"> Azeraphel Lorekeeper</a>, who MC'd the event and patiently posed for multiple photos. (Is he really only 22?) I'd also like to thank the people of Turbine for participating wholeheartedly in the event and for their graciousness to the fans. It was incredibly fun meeting the people who bring us such a kick-ass game. Special thanks to Cassie for her contributions to the fabulous door prizes, particularly Teen Digital Diva II.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      ---------------------------------------------------<br>
      TO RAISE A BANNER OF FLAME<br>
      ---------------------------------------------------<br>
      I will say it again (and no, I'm not being sarcastic); what a great patch! There was so much new content that much of it is still undiscovered. Stop by your favorite news site to read the statement released by Turbine about The inside scoop on July's Quests. The major
      &quot;Frore-like quest" is still waiting for your ingenuity, as well as the improved Sword of Lost Light, rumored to be in this patch. I know many of you were too obsessed about the Shadow Hunter armor to notice all the goodies dropped on us in July, but you can find a summary of some of the new content on my To Raise A Banner of Flame page in the Culture section.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Turbine's wicked sense of humor was really working full force this patch. They added a "Camping Ineptitude" spell which not only reduces your chance of finding phat
      lewt, but also bursts forth the face of Allen Grey when you spring the trap on the chest. In addition, there's a new vendor on Aerlinthe who sells Monarch and Patron T-shirts which read, "My Patron went to Aerlinthe and all I got was this lousy shirt." Made me laugh.<br>
      <br>
      --------------------------------<br>
      TIDBITS<br>
      --------------------------------<br>
      For those unfortunates (like myself!) who turned their Fire Auroch Horns into the NPC and received a big fat nothing in return, I have this tidbit of help for you: the Fire Auroch Horns must come from a Fire Auroch BULL, not a Cow or Yearling. And finally, I think we've got the stats hammered out. The bows built with Fire Auroch Horns yield a +2% Defense Bonus; Mattekar Horns yield +6%.<br>
      <br>

      AC SITES IN THE NEWS<br>
      ---------------------------------------<br>
      Guardians of Dereth<br>
      <a href="http://god.acsage.com/" target="_blank">http://god.acsage.com/</a><br>
      You might have seen this site mentioned on some of the news sites. The Guardians of
      Dereth, a Harvestgain allegiance, have compiled an economy report which gives approximate values for some of the items which double as currency in
      Dereth: Motes, Sturdy Iron Keys,  Shards &amp; Fragments, Composite Bow Components, etc. Since this is a dynamic game environment, values are constantly shifting, but this is a invaluable resource for people like me who just don't have a clue. I use the report to get a general idea of what things are currently trading for!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      AC Explorer 2.2&nbsp;<br>
      <a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/ac" target="_blank">http://www.zuggsoft.com/ac</a><br>
      A new version of AC Explorer, using the new map from David Simpson derived from the cell.dat files, has been released! If you've never used AC Explorer, you're missing out on a great tool to help you navigate your way through
      Dereth. AC Explorer uses the data from AC Spedia locations database and is provided to you by the Silver Citadel Allegiance.<br>

      AC Tracker<br>

      Ned Cleversun swears by Asheron Call Location Tracker (ACTrack) -- a real time location monitoring utility. One function he particularly likes is its ability to help him locate his corpse. Of course that doesn't help him much when his corpse is surrounded by those dreaded new skeletons, but at least he knows where it is! Running on a network? Watch your activities on a 2nd computer or monitor as you travel through
      Dereth.<br>

      MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS SITE NEWS!<br>
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      Congratulations to Ned Cleversun who recently got his Composite Bow! I am proud to say that as his Patron, I helped contribute to the cause by providing the two Mattekar Horns. Thank you Subutai for making the trade with me. And special thanks to Danier for arranging the alchemist and for buffing Ned's stats while he strung his bow. Ned Cleversun broke two strings before succeeding on his third with a buffed bow skill of 272.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      June site stats inched up with approximately 1,145,000 hits for the month and over 144,000 page views. Unique user sessions rose over 200 per day from May's stats, averaging just over 1400 per day. People visiting tend to stay a while and browse, I was pleased to note. The site had visitors from over 50 countries around the world! The most popular pages continue to be the quests, although the Runway and Letters are increasing in popularity. I was especially delighted to find that due to my whining of last month, my own Runway page was the most popular in June. (But only by a smidgen. :) I think it was my purple legs; they're very attractive.<br>
      <br>
      I've also added a page titled Stuff I'd Like in response to all the visitors who write to me offering help with the site. The screenshots and information a small loyal core of people email to me are invaluable in helping me keep on top of the new quests, weapons, etc. and other changes in the game. If you'd like to help, stop by and see if you have stats or screenshots for the items I have listed. I will be eternally grateful for your contributions! :)<br>
      <br>
      See you in the game!<br>
