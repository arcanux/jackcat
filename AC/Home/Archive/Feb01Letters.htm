    I have never gotten a virindi cloak off a mossie mire witch from anywhere
    but the one spawn south of the Wai Jhou hut. The one south of the Wai Jhou
    hut spawns every 20 minutes and will drop the cloak and a lore book every 4
    out of 5 times.

    Thanks for the info. I've heard conflicting reports. Some have claimed to
    have gotten a Cloak from the Mosswart Mire Witch that spawns near Gragghk.
    Yours is the 2nd confirmed report I've received about the spawn
    near Wei Jhou. I've also had confirmation that a spawn near the East
    Direlands portal drops the cloak as well. I'll go ahead and update the quest to reflect
    the info. Thanks
    again!</font></p>
