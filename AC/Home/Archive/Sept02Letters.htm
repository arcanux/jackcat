        I am sorry to inform you that the guild tagged War Angel has dissolved 
        into ruins. Nearly 50 percent of the guild members have merged the 
        remnants with NWA, but I did not. I have joined the Fremen Knights (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.funnylittleman.com/knights">www.funnylittleman.com/knights</a>) 
        and am happy. <br>
        <br>
        I just thought I would let you know so you can update the you site. 
        Thank you for the exposure<span lang="en-us">;</span> it was nice to be 
        known. <br>
        <br>
        Also, thank you for the sit<span lang="en-us">e</span> that you do. It 
        has made playing the game completely fun. I a<span lang="en-us">pp</span>reciate

        would be honored to assist. <br>

        <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi War Angel -<br>
        Thanks for updating me on your allegiance. Since I started the
        <a href="../../Monarchy/index.htm">Monarchies of 
        Dereth</a> section, I've received mail from many of the allegiances I've 
        listed so far, asking me to change this or that, update it, remove 
        so-and-so's comments because they left, and so forth. Because of the 
        natural fluid nature of monarchies, I've been re-thinking the section. 
        It's really impossible for me to keep up with the wok it would take to 
        keep the changes current. Instead, these may simply have to be snapshots 
        in time. And I may make a commitment to update the pages quarterly, or 
        something like that. I'm giving it some thought right now. I figured 
        your letter would be a good chance for me to respond to the letters I've 
        been getting asking about the section. Good luck with your new 
        allegiance!</span></font></font></p>

        James Arrowswift -<br>
        You're right that there are still some elementals. Certain towns are 
        under attack from special golems, accompanied by elementals. But these 
        are special localized spawns. What people are referring to is that in 
        the previous patch, normal spawns throughout the landscape were replaced 
        by elemental spawns. Where you used to be able to find Mattekars, you 
        would then find Elementals. Want to hunt Lugians outside? Elementals. 
        And so on and so forth. These elemental spawns are gone and creatures 
        have returned to their natural habitats. Hope that clears things up.</font></span></p>

        Hi Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Lately, I've been hearing numerous hypotheses both in game and on the 
        forums regarding the pending &quot;cataclysm&quot; with Dereth. You know I'm a bit 
        of a lore junky, so here's my thought:<br>
        <br>
        I feel that all three story arcs will converge into one again - The 
        Virindi, Shadow, Olthoi will swarm Human Towns after the defeat of 
        Gaerlan. The only way for us to defeat it is by killing some &quot;crystal&quot; 
        which will kill everyone on the server instantly (cool, huh?). After 
        this, we scurry into the tunnels made by Asheron.<br>
        <br>
        What do you think will cause the downfall and destruction of our cities? 
        What do you think Turbine will do to combine the AC 1 arc into the AC 
        1.5 Arc (after the Cataclysm) to keep gamers interested?<br>
        <br>
        Thanks!<br>

        Hi Nocturn of LC -<br>
        Since the cataclysm is still 300 years in the future, a lot could happen 
        between now and then. But as cataclysms and human downfalls go, I think 
        it will be the classic usuals: lust for power, blind ambition, greed, 
        etc. etc. An early
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamespy.com/e32002/pc/asheron2/">

        the fight for shards of power among the different kingdoms of Dereth. </font></span></font></p>

        <br>
        I don't know if it's appeared publicly or not, but fighting on Aerlinthe 
        against Virindi Executors and an Inquisitor, Nuo, also in Alliance with 
        me, had some breaking news for me.<br>
        <br>
        I Have a 318 base Axe, 222 base strength and was fully buffed with VIIs 
        and was still hitting Virindi Executors for 1 or 2 points of damage. Nuo 
        told me that the new Phantom axe, which I had previously considered 
        another vanity quest item, was somewhat effective against them. Indeed 
        it was; I slew my first Inquisitor with no little help from Nuo, hitting 
        for 15 -21 normally and up to 43 on criticals.<br>
        <br>
        Again, maybe others had already known of this, but I sure didn't<span lang="en-us">,</span>

        The easiest way to find all the Axe quests is to simply look on the
        <a href="../../Sports/Axe.htm">Axes</a> page in 
        the <a href="../../Sports/sports.htm">Sports</a> 
        section. The axes in the game are separated out into quest/crafted axes, 
        store bought axes, and a random sampling of looted axes. Hope that

        meeting me in-game, that's not something I usually agree to. I actually 
        get a lot of requests from people and I just simply don't have time. I 
        have an extremely busy job that eats up a lot of my time. I usually only 
        get to play AC a few times a week, and then and for not-long periods of 
        time. If I spent that time socializing, I would have very little left 
        over for actually playing. So, I'm sorry, but I always have to say no to 
        these sorts of requests across the board. Nothing personal.</font></span></p>

        <br>
        Dear Maggie -- <br>
        <br>
        I saw your mention of the upcoming AC2 site, and have looked over the
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.derethliving.com/">Dereth Living</a> 
        pages. Everything looks wonderful! Really good work, congratulations. 
        Your efforts will help Asheron's Call adventurers master a new world. 
        Eventually.<br>
        <br>
        But, er ...when were you planning to make the new site available to 
        every body out there? I mean, that's not what we did last time, 
        remember? <br>
        <br>
        Your first site was up for QUITE A FEW MONTHS for just ME. I was able to 
        benefit from all the tables and lists and coordinates and data and so 
        forth. It gave me an &quot;edge,&quot; and helped me compete effectively. It was 
        very handy!<br>
        <br>
        So, I was wondering if, you know, we could perhaps do the same thing 
        with the new site. Put it up for everyone some time next Spring, or 
        early Summer. That will give you time to make it EXTRA GOOD and may 
        actually increase its success and acceptance. People can be VERY 
        CRITICAL, as I know you know. <br>
        <br>
        I would be glad to act as a sort of one-person beta team. I could 
        provide valuable feedback about what types of information to emphasize. 
        I know you'll want to have a lot of material about archery, for example.<br>
        <br>
        Another benefit is that you would save the cost of hosting and bandwidth 
        -- because you wouldn't need to actually host the site until next Summer 
        or Fall! Just send me the new or updated pages via email or ZIP disk.
        <br>
        <br>
        I could also stop by and pick up print-outs of the pages. I'm excited! 
        Let me know how we should handle it; I'm ready to start testing whenever 
        you give the word. <br>
        <br>
        What do you think about shooting for a super-duper rollout maybe next 
        Christmas? That is, Christmas 2003. Lots of press releases, lots of 
        &quot;buzz,&quot; the works! I think this project will set a new standard for 
        wonderfulness, so let's take the time we need to get it right. Thanks!<br>

        That's a very interesting idea you have. As you know, I'm actually quite 
        a perfectionist and very detailed. I can see how working on the site for 
        another year or so will make it just that much better.</font></font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Rest 
        assured that as of right now, although I have announced the URL, I have
        <i>not</i> done the official public launch of the site. I think it's too 
        soon; too much work remains to be done. So although you may have to 
        share the data with a few enterprising individuals who are secretly 
        poking around the site in these early days, I want you to know that 
        everything there so far has been published just for you!! </font></span></p>
