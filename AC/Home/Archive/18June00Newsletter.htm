    EXCITING NEW SPELL RESEARCH IN DERETH!<br>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    It's the most exciting part of this month's event, in Maggie the Jackcat's opinion! Mages
    from all worlds have banded together to pool information on the new War Spells introduced
    in June's patch. There's been much gnashing of teeth, flaring of tempers, moments (or
    days) of frustration and despair, and the usual accusatory remarks tossed at Turbine for
    not doing things right! ;-) But who can't sense the thrill of an impending discovery,
    hovering on the edge of the horizon! <br>
    <br>
    Incredible research is currently taking place at the Council of Collegium Arcani -- a
    group of players determined to unlock the secrets of the new spells. These travelling
    teachers will then use their new found knowledge to assist other players through demos and
    instruction. Building on each other's work, they are compiling a database of information
    as they methodically test new theories and formulae. <br>
    <br>
    Two Darktide mages, Shattenkind, a well-known monarch famous for his role-playing skills,
    and the mysterious Brittle Mage, have apparently uncovered some of Dereth's magical
    secrets. Links to screenshots of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; and &quot;Searing Disc&quot;
    have appeared on the Crossroads of Dererth's Collegium Arcani board! Also released have
    been some fascinating and mysterious missives by the two mages, which give hints to the
    elusive formulae. &quot;Sentinels gone bad?&quot; Jesse in disguise? These are just two of
    the theories bandied about by the non-believers! I, however, have complete faith in the
    citizens of Dereth and know that their hard work, intelligence, native craftiness and
    cooperation will soon pay off in knowledge hard won! <br>
    <br>
    *Sigh* Ahhh, nostalgia. It all reminds me of the early days of Beta when the winds carried
    whispered rumors of &quot;Portal Spells.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    For more discussion on magic and the new spells, visit Crossroads of Dereth's Collegium
    Arcani board:<br>

    Be warned, though! They sound like a buncha Archers, before the patch! ;) <br>

    Crossroads of Dereth<br>
    <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">http://cod.xrgaming.net</a><br>
    Crossroads of Dereth is in the News again! (Yes, I'm biased! :) Two excellent events are
    now being touted on this fabulous gaming site. <br>
    <br>
    1) The Grand Loremaster Competition, hosted by Ryan Idol of Thistledown<br>
    Congratulations go out to Keth al-Sheth, Thistledown Loremaster, the winner of the first
    round in this unique contest. More players battle tonight on Morningthaw for the title,
    with competitions on the other worlds to follow. The winner from each world will meet to
    compete for the title of Grand Loremaster! Vertitus Venatus from CoD was there on
    Thistledown with a camera and took these great pics! Special appearance by Stormwaltz! <a href="http://www.engl.niu.edu/cwilliams/lore/contest.html" target="_blank">http://www.engl.niu.edu/cwilliams/lore/contest.html</a><br>
    <br>
    For more information on the contest and contestants, visit the Hall of Lore on CoD.<br>

    <br>
    2) Asheron's Call Player Luncheon<br>
    Crossroads gaming network is sponsoring a Player Gathering in Boston, July 15th! <br>
    <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/gathering/" target="_blank">http://cod.xrgaming.net/gathering/</a><br>
    Maggie the Jackcat attended the first Player Gathering in Minnesota and just couldn't pass
    up another chance to see the hilarious game &quot;Whose Drudge is it Anyway?&quot; Come
    join us in Boston for some food and fun. Meet your favorite Turbinites. Have your burning
    questions answered in the Q&amp;A session hosted by Azeraphel Lorekeeper. (So, is it
    SAHL-claim, or SOLE-claim?) Find out if I'm as good looking in person as I am in the game!
    There's still time to register. Don't miss it!<br>
    <br>
    Paladins of Asheron<br>
    <a href="http://www.paladinsofasheron.org/" target="_blank">http://www.paladinsofasheron.org/</a><br>
    Here's another great Allegiance site with an attractive design and good info. They've got
    a great list of Merchants which includes both the buying and selling rate. This site also
    includes dungeon maps, portals and lifestones, town information, and other databases.
    Looks like the only thing they're missing is a link to me! Nicely done.<br>

    MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS SITE NEWS!<br>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    <br>
    I just love checking my stats, to find out what people like and what they don't like. I
    thought others might like a quick rundown of the May stats of my Jackcat site. For the
    month, there were over 1,000,000 hits and over 133,000 page views. Unique user sessions
    have steadily risen over the past weeks and now average over 1,200 a day.<br>
    <br>
    The most popular pages continue to be the quest pages, with the Shadow Armor and Atlan
    Weapons leading the pack. Frore and the Impious Staff are not far behind. The Runway
    continues to get amazing amounts of traffic, and generates quite a bit of mail as well. I
    was disappointed to note that I was *not* the most popular Runway model for May. (No, I
    won't tell you who was!) I am sure it could only be because I was on at the tail end of
    the month. Ha.<br>
    <br>
    Volunteers for the Runway are stacking up, in part because of my limited play time lately.
    Thanks to everyone who has volunteered so far. I will try to get each and every one of you
    up on the site soon. Try not to lose your stuff in the meantime!<br>
    <br>
    Letters, Maps, Portals, Coordinates, Fletching, Alchemy, Designer Wear and Beasties round
    out some of the top pages. Thanks to all for visiting! And thanks for all the fan mail.
    Sometimes it takes me a while to respond, but I appreciate each and every letter. I will
    continue to try and keep my ego in check in the face of your effusive praise and generous
    compliments! I am also happy to report that the mail requesting information on the Nexus
    Armor has slowed to a manageable trickle!<br>
    <br>
    ------------------------<br>
    STUFF I'D LIKE<br>
    ------------------------<br>
    <br>
    In my continuing efforts to provide some of the best quest guides in the game, I'd like to
    ask for some help on the new bow/X-bow quest. Thanks to Loki the Lucky, I have great data
    on the Sinews, including pics of the different versions and skill check stats. I'm looking
    for similar information on some of the other components. If you have screenshots, or skill
    check data for the quest, for any of the following, please send them to <a href="mailto:thejackcat@xrgaming.net">thejackcat@xrgaming.net</a>. Thanks!<br>
