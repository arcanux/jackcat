      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I absolutely love getting your
      letters, and love all the contributions you make, but I must admit that I
      may have to change my statement that all letters will receive a personal
      response. I've been from 200-300 letters behind for several months now and
      don't seem to be any closer to catching up. I'll see how it goes in the
      next few weeks and hope that I haven't hurt anyone's feelings! It doesn't
      mean that I don't love you! :)</small></font></p>

      But on a more exciting note, his loyalty is also up 2 more points to 142!
      I must say that <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Danier.htm">Danier's</a>
      bragging about his 147 Loyalty stat turned out to be super-good for me!
      Congratulations to both Ned and Danier: Ned for breaking the Level 50
      barrier (he's actually Level 51 now!), and to Danier for making the Top 10
      list for Focus!</small></font></p>

      of publishing more of the many, many letters I received, I've summarized
      the major themes for your enjoyment. Did you know that women in the

      soooo glad that Maggie the Jackcat's Kick-Ass Fabulous AC Web Site doesn't
      get the kind of visitors that seem to populate Lum's site and CoD's
      boards!! ;-) I received so many thoughtful, interesting letters from
      people commenting on my Boobie Dress page, I was impressed once again with
      the intelligence and maturity of AC players! I have the *best* fans!&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Some still like them and some
      still hate them, but I think this discussion over the new boobie dresses
      has generated more interesting discourse than any other issue in AC so
      far. Read more letters <a href="../../Apparel/Boobie.htm">here</a>!
