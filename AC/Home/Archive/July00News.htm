      31,
    2000<br>
      </strong><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters section</a> updated! I wanted to
      try to get a few more posted before the end of the month since so many of
      you have written to me telling me how much you like to read the
      letters.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Once again, I will just mention how behind I am in answering email. It's
      amazing how much mail can pile up while you're out of town. I apologize to
      those awaiting responses. It doesn't mean that I don't love you. :)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July
      30,
    2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>The <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a> has a new
      model! Meet <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Zenk.htm">Zenk</a>, otherwise known
      as the &quot;Greave Queen.&quot; This high level player pointed out that I
      had sadly neglected the lowly greave in my Runway section. But not
      anymore! See if you agree with Zenk's claim that Gharun'dims have nice
      legs.</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Special thanks to everyone who
      has sent me some of the pics I requested on the <a href="../Stuff.htm">Stuff
      I'd Like</a> page!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 25,
    2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I'm back! And you can read all about my summer vacation <a href="../ACPL.htm">here</a>,
    as I go on and on and on about the recent Player Gathering in Boston. It's going to take
    me a few days to get back in the swing of things, so don't expect major site updates too
    soon! And, as always, I'm <em>extremely</em> behind in answering mail.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I did manage a few addtions! Upped Ned Cleversun
    loyalty by one point to 121 and upped his death total by 42 to 431. I just can't
    understand why the game is still so unbalanced. ;-)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I also added a page called <a href="../Stuff.htm">Stuff
    I'd Like</a>. I've had so many people offer to help gather screenshots and info, but
    haven't really had an organized way to let people know what I need. If you're feeling
    virtuous, and know how to take screenshots, I'd appreciate the assistance!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I also put the <a href="18June00Newsletter.htm">June 18th edition</a> of the Newsletter up on the
    web.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Last of all, I meant to make this change before
    leaving town, but somehow, time just got away from me (ok, ok, I was playing the game
    instead of packing for my trip). I incorrectly identified Nandesu Ka as the person who
    discovered Garaena. It was actually her wonderful vassal Ha'ak al-Qulus</small>. <small>Sorry
    Ha'ak! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 13, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Since I'm going to be heading out of town early Friday, and still have
    massive amounts to do to wrap things up at work before my longest vacation in years (don't
    freak; it's only a week and a half :), this may be my last update for quite some time. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>For that reason, I've put up the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hollow.htm">Hollow Weapons</a> quest, even though it's still
    missing a few pics and stats. Sorry, but didn't have time to finish the Ravenous Weapons
    or Jitte quest.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I've also updated the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Banner2.htm">To Raise A Banner of Flame</a> page with more pics,
    weapons, stats and lore, including a pic of Garaena the Emissary, sent by Nandesu Ka. Is
    this the start of a new Frore-like quest on the mysterious ass-kickin island of
    Aerlinthe?! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>It's possible I may be able to do an update or
    two while out of town, but no promises. Please don't stop sending pics and info while I'm
    gone! And maybe say hello to Ned Cleversun in-game now and again. I don't want him to get
    too lonely while I'm gone. :)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 12, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>The new patch is here!! Maggie the Jackcat would like to thank Wynder at
    CoD for his assistance this morning in correcting my AC.dll troubles.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>What an update! New creatures, new spells, new
    weapons (Melee got some LOVE!!), new quests, new landmass, new boots and a NEW FEZ!! Yay!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Check out the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm">Dereth History</a> Section and
    the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Banner2.htm">To Raise A Banner of Flame</a> pages for more!
    As always, those cheeky <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Rumors.htm">Town Criers</a> have
    all the latest news, including word on those poor <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
    Armor</a> Smiths. How many times were they killed? Yes, that's right! Repeatedly!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To read some of the boards, you'd think this
    (and that known transfer spell bug) was the only change in the game!</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Other news:</small><br>
    <small>Ned Cleversun's death total rises again. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Plus I finally updated the stats of the new creatures from the last patch in my <a href="../../Pets/beasties.htm">Beasties</a> section. Thanks to Kev and to Danier for all the
    screenshots of the stats!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 11, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Maggie the Jackcat has a new look! I did so much whining all over the site
    about this wonderful purple girth I lost a long time ago (my first Tusker!) that people
    from several servers started writing to me, offering me their special purple finds. First
    Vilegoroth bedecked me in the most fabulous Yoroi leggings ever to be seen (with boots,
    gloves, hat and sword to match!), then Gheres Reficul passed on a Studded Leather girth to
    me. Now, thanks to the very generous Lycius Hawkblayde of the <a href="http://silverwolves.acsage.com/" target="_blank">Order of the Silverwolves</a> and
    an unsuspecting Olthoi, I'm the proud owner of the prettiest Hauberk on Thistledown!</small></font>
    </p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">I used to poke fun (in a completely loving way,
    of course!) at the foolish ones, striving for their monochrome look. But now that I am
    decked out in purple from head to toe, I am convinced there's no better looking fool in
    the game! I'm so taken with my new look that I've updated my main page with a new pic!
    Thank you, thank you to my generous benefactors!</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> updated with several questions on the finer
    points of Composite Bow making. Too bad I didn't know all the answers! I'm still seeking
    stats on lower level bows if you have some to share!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 9, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small><a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Stiletto.htm">Stiletto</a> is up on the Runway!
    This page is a companion piece to <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Sara.htm">Sara Truflight's</a>
    page. Stiletto is her in-game fiancé!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Ned Cleversun: Up 2 Loyalty, up 10 Deaths. He's
    just got to be the best vassal ever!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 6, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I knew Ned Cleversun's death total had not been updated for a while, but I
    was shocked to hear it had skyrocketed from 310 to 367! In his email to me, telling me his
    current stats, Ned has asked me to publicly mention his gratitude to <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Danier.htm" target="_top">Danier</a>,
    who saved his bacon, not once, but twice last night, during lag-related carnage at Fort
    Teth. Thank you, Danier, for rescuing my impetuous vassal once again!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>On a happier note, Ned Cleversun increased his
    Loyalty another three points to 118! I think Danier has been a good influence on him! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>New <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm" target="_top">Runway</a>
    feature!! Sara Truflight, Morningthaw Archer and Grand Council Member for <a href="http://www.illuminati-ac.com" target="_blank">The Illuminati</a>, shows off some of
    her many beautiful outfits! Sara has a collection unlike any I have ever seen, including a
    set of Celdon Shadow Armor, several sets of Yoroi, multiple Koujia sets, plus more, too
    numerous to mention! Take in peek in Sara's enormous closet <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Sara.htm" target="_top">here</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I've done some minor tweaking to the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Composite.htm">Composite Bows &amp; Crossbows</a> quest, updating
    the Crossbow speed for the medium level. Thanks to Deadly Pride of Darktide! It also is
    appearing more and more that the type of Horn used determines the Melee defense. Again, if
    you have stats for some of the lower or medium level Bows or Crossbows, I'd love to have
    them! Thanks to Koveras for the picture of the twisted guts!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>July 5, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I know it's been several days since I updated the site, but I hope it's
    worth the wait! I've finally gotten the new <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Composite.htm" target="_top">Composite
    Bows &amp; Crossbows</a> quest written up. Stats on the lower level bows are still pretty
    scarce. If you've made one of the Bows or Crossbows using the Fire Auroch Horns, I'd love
    it if you could <a href="mailto:Maggie@thejackcat.com">email your stats to me</a>. Thanks
    once again to Loki the Lucky and to Quixotic for their help.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The quest is also up on the <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">Crossroad of Dereth</a> site, in addition
    to a few others. If you're interested in the starter quests, I've added the Holtburg
    Starter Quests and the Brogord's Axe quest there.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Other Addtions:</small><br>
    <small>Ned Cleversun's Loyalty up to 115! His death total, I know, can't still be 310, but
    I am waiting for an update.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> Section
    Updated. <a href="OldLetters_TOC.htm">June Letters</a> and <a href="June00News.htm">June New Stuff</a> Archived.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Maggie the Jackcat is now level 25, thanks to my
    28% vitae and the need to work it off! Yay! (Yay to the leveling, not to 28% vitae :)
    Thanks to Shaarak and my wonderful vassal Ned Cleversun for helping me recover my bodies.</small></font></td>
