        thinking something along the lines of visiting galleries, and going to 
        craft fairs and so forth.) I was happy with Lockpick in Shopping until 
        the addition of Mnemosynes, and with the new keyrings, I think it's 
        finally earned its place under Arts &amp; Crafts. Yes, I know my

        but spare a thought for us European players. Turbine and Microsoft are 
        happy to take our subscriptions but the game provides no European 
        support. I would think that they could hold some kind of European event. 
        There are quite a few Euros who play whom I am sure would like to meet 
        the people at Turbine.<br>
        <br>
        I know you like the Devs and people at Turbine so this letter may not

        <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">
        I'm sure it has to do with time and money and the fact that all the Devs 
        are in Boston. That'd be a big commitment of resources and it's probably 
        not in the budget. The ACPLs really are great fun!! A few European 
        players have made it in previous years, but I know it's too expensive 
        and difficult for most. A European ACPL would be cool. I'd be tempted to 
        go! Some of my favorite online friends are European players.</font></span></font></p>

        <p>Hello, Maggie. I've just been reading 
        your letters page. They are, as usual, fine and entertaining. They also 
        induce a certain, er, nostalgia for the good old days of November, 2002. 
        That is because they were written in November 2002. As I said, fine 
        material!<br>
        <br>
        I propose some NEW letters! How about April, 2003?? I'm sure that in 
        some nook or closet there is a steadily growing pile of April emails 
        accumulating! I betcha many of them are absolutely funny and 
        fascinating.<br>

        Look! All your incessant nagging and pestering and wheedling and whining 
        has finally paid off. I am updating my Letters section! Your email was 
        also a little, er, nostalgia inducing, but I thought it'd be a fine one 
        to get back into the groove with. It has an added benefit of showing 
        people that I'm serious when I say because of the volume of mail I 
        receive, I cannot give personal responses. See? I don't even answer my

        <p><span lang="en-us">Sorry I had to bugger out last night towards the 
        end of the quest. I just wanted to let you know that you can make it 
        through the room of rolling balls WITHOUT jumping on the platforms. <br>
        <br>
        I went back to the dungeon this morning. In the room of rolling death, 
        run over and stand UNDER the first platform on the left that causes all 
        of the balls to explode. Just hang there until you feel comfortable with 
        where the ball spawn, and how they roll, and run straight across into 
        the portal. <br>
        <br>
        I made it once and thought I was lucky, only to find out that my jump 
        wasn't high enough for room two. Being the mage I am, I had a bow, but 
        no arrows. I promptly recalled out grabbed some arrows and did it a 
        second time. So I'm fairly confident in saying that it can be done 
        consistently; if I did it twice without a death, any could learn how!<br>
        <br>
        One other thing I didn't see listed. In the room after the rolling 
        balls, there are arrows that continually hit you. My personal suggestion 
        would be to buff up before doing the rolling balls of death, and be 
        ready to whip out that bow and arrow! ;-)<br>

        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Hi Dumbledore -<br>
        Thanks for the great info. For a quest whose most ferocious opponents 
        are a spinning puzzle box and a stationary target, that certainly was 
        one heart-pounding nerve-wracking adventure! I couldn't believe it when 
        I made it across the platforms over the rolling balls of death and 
        through the Eagle's Sight portal. Thank heavens for the hours Danier 
        patiently spent with me in Artifex Vault teaching me how to jump, after 
        my numerous embarrassing attempts at the Major Smoldering Stone. 
        Nonetheless, I still panicked and dumped 40 points into my Jump skill 
        right on the spot after watching one person after another get crushed 
        flat as a pancake right before my eyes. Your fellow Dumbledore has died!

        Hi Maggie!<br>
        I just wanted to say thanks to you for all that you do for the players 
        of AC.<br>
        <br>
        I recently purchased AC:DM for myself and my lovely wife. We love the 
        game, but aside from the newbie quests, a lot of the game was a mystery 
        not easily cracked by a couple of ol' farts like ourselves. After 
        joining a 'guild' (Knights Who Say Ni!), we quickly learned that the 
        best place for information was your site. Quickly I learned to find a 
        vast amount of information about the game here, both big and small in 
        detail. Each day at work I study the site's many pages to look for what 
        my wife and myself can quest for later that night.<br>
        <br>
        You have poured so much of your energy into this site, and while I'm 
        sure you get praise from many of your in-game friends, I just wanted you 
        to know that the new players (yes, many still are buying it for the 
        first time) of AC truly truly truly appreciate what you do, and thank 
        you for the effort you put forth. Keep up the good work, and even though 
        the game may be old or burnout has arrived for many, this site is needed 
        more than ever by us new folks.<br>
        <br>
        You're very kind and generous with your time, so it was the least I 
        could do to send you a thank you. We luv ya kiddo, you rock!<br>

        I love this kind of mail. In my book, there's no such thing as too
