    <font face="Arial" size="2">I'm sure I'll be updating the Aerlinthe quest 
pages in the near future with fabulous screenshots: Maggie kills the Behemoth; 
Maggie kills the Hellfire; Maggie tours Aefalle's Keep; Maggie hides behind 
Danier in the Nightmare Wisp room; Maggie kills the Lady; Maggie loses all her 
buffs by setting off all the Magic Traps. ;-) For now, everyone can enjoy this 
pic of me with my new Robe and Sword! ha.</font></p>

    <font face="Arial" size="2">Yet another page in the
<a href="../../Pets/pets.htm">Pets</a> section updated 
    with pop-up pics: the
    <a href="../../Pets/siraluun.htm">Siraluun</a> from 
    Marae Lassel. Thanks to everyone helping to fill in the holes!
    <a href="../../Pets/undead.htm">Undead</a> section 
    updated with pic of Lady Aerfalle... ;-)<br>
<br>
    Yet another lowbie quest added to the

    section: visit the

    Banderling Camp</a> for your very own Quarter Staff of Fire or Fire Spear!</font><p>
