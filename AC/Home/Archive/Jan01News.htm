      Platinum scarabs into the Dereth economy. Possible rollback! Ned Cleversun
      reported from remarkable scene at Teth, where people were dropping stuff
      all over the ground to make room for D notes. Trident sent some pics from

      This high level monarch and his fun crew have been extremely helpful, not
      only assisting in keeping my needy vassal supplied, but also by their
      generous contributions to this website. I originally intented to launch
      this section for AC's 1 year anniversary, but better late than
      never!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For this first entry, I've gone the extra mile and posted snazzy
