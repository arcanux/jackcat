    <p><b>September 12, 2001 - Recent Events</b>
    </p>
    <p>Hi Maggie,&nbsp;<br>
    I play on Morningthaw, but I live in England. I was just writing to say that
    I am a big fan of the site, and that my thoughts are with you and all the people of America this past
    twenty-four hours.  The events that I have  seen are almost beyond belief on
    T.V. and have brought me almost to tears many times. Every 15 minutes there are new news reports on the radio and
    T.V.<br>
    <br>
    I just thought that I'd write to you after logging on and seeing your message, to offer some small token of support, both to you and yours and all the
    AC players that will have been affected by this terrible event. I'm lost for words
    really; nothing I can say can possibly help, all I will say is keep your chin
    up:)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    (I hope you didn't mind me writing, seeing as I am a complete stranger, and don't feel that you have to
    reply. I just thought that I'd write to say that our prayers are with you
    all.)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Respectfully,&nbsp;<br>
    Dominic Blaze
    </p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Dear Dominic Blaze -<br>
    Thank you for writing. And thank you for allowing me to publish your letter on
    the site. I think we've all been feeling the need to reach out, in whatever
    way we can, over these devastating events. I'm sure there are many many
    people who will appreciate the sentiments.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Your letter (and your 2nd one as well), and the
    letters of others from the AC community, touched me in a way that the
    countless news reports have not. It's hard to explain really, but it made the enormity of the
    tragedy hit home. Maybe it was the echo of how helpless
    so many of us are feeling. Or maybe it was seeing that the whole world is
    grieving. I'm not sure. I do know, however, that *I* felt better after
    reading your letter. I hope others do too.</font>
