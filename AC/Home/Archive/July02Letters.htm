    in Creature AI</span></b></p>
    <p>Dear Maggie,<br>
    <span lang="en-us">L</span>et me start off (as always) by saying how much I love your site. Thanks for 
    ma<span lang="en-us">k</span>ing the ACPL pictures available as well; looked like everyone had tons of 
    fun. As a side note, please meet up with me in a dark alleyway of your 
    choice and make sure you have all your Beta account details on you. I 
    promise I won't hurt you. *grin*<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I am sending you a copy of a post I made on our Guild's message 
    boards (The Rangers of Dereth) concerning the seemingly changed spawn 
    density and creature AI. Hope this information helps!</p>
    <p>I have not noticed any density changes, either on Vesayen near Cathedral or 
    in the South Dires near the Emissary.<br>
    <br>
    What I have noticed, however, are two changes<span lang="en-us">:<br>
    </span><br>
    1) The respawn rate for critters on <span lang="en-us">the </span>Vesayen
    <span lang="en-us">Isles </span>seemed to be much higher, 
    especially for the undead. I would kill a group, run away from them, and 
    before the spawn point even left my compass range there was a respawn. I am 
    not completely sure about this<span lang="en-us">,</span> however, might just be my faulty perception.<br>
    <br>
    2) Creature AI has definitely changed, at least I can confirm this for 
    Sclavus and Undead near <span lang="en-us">the </span>Cathedral on Vesayen. Wher<span lang="en-us">e</span>as their usual strategy 
    was to fire War spells and debuff you from afar and only run up to you after 
    a while, their current attack pattern is just the reverse. That is, they run 
    up to you first and then let off their fireworks display. Be aware of that 
    when you take your archers over there to hunt. :)<br>
    <br>
    Cheers,<br>

    Thanks for the info! In addition to the Vesayens, the Obsidian Plains have 
    definitely changed as well. They are the treacherous death traps of old, the 
    land of 40% vitae and permanent item loss! Whoo-hoo!</span></font></p>

    <p>I know that your webpage is a place for hard information -<span lang="en-us">-</span> it's not a public 
    forum :P And I'm not trying to get this published <span lang="en-us">-</span>- I just wondered what 
    *you* thought of this possibility: <span lang="en-us">s</span>ince there is a portal to Ispar on top 
    of Gaerlan's... whatever it is, do you think that maybe Martine will finally 
    have a chance to go back home?<br>
    <br>
    I'm guessing this from 1) the information on your page about the Ispar 
    Portal -<span lang="en-us">-</span> I could never live long enough to go see for myself! 
    <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;and </span>2) 
    Martine is now being given a chance to <span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>reform<span lang="en-us">,&quot;</span> it seems, and I'm hoping 
    that the Devs would be kind enough to give Martine's story a HAPPY ending if 
    possible. What could be better than Martine going home, after all these 
    years? Of course, I don't know how his wife would handle seeing a Humarindi 
    running up to her for a hug and a kiss, but... at least he could find out 
    what happened to her. That would be good, right?<br>
    <br>
    Anyway... I bet you 2 pyreal that Martine is gonna at least TRY to go 
    through that portal!<br>

    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Agent Blank -<br>
    I've always liked that Martine character, one of my faves. I'd be ok either 
    way, with an unhappy or happy ending. He reminds me of the tragic Greek 
    hero, his own misfortunes self-wrought by his own hand, his willingness to 
    walk away from his happiness with Melaney and Arrita to heed the call. At least 
    he has finally acknowledged that he had a choice and he made the wrong one. 
    Odysseus made it home, just in the nick of time. Maybe Martine will do the 
    same. Or maybe he'll get there too late! Melaney will be dead, or remarried, 
    or worse, and his daughter will be unforgiving with a heart of stone. And in 
    therapy! And even the dog hates him! </span></font></p>
    <p>
    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Of course he could dive through 
    that portal to Ispar and <i>we may never know</i> what he finds on the other 
    side. That would be oh so cruel, would it not? That's my vote!</span></font></p>

    up Isparian Weapons</b></p>
    <p>I've completed my tests on the Shimmering Isparian Bow. It buffs to 30 
    Bonus Damage (Blood Drinker VII on a normal bow gives you 22 BD) which 
    accounts for many people doing much higher damage. <br>
    <br>
    However, it does NOT do <span lang="en-us">&quot;</span>extra<span lang="en-us">&quot;</span> damage to single-elemental monsters or 
    physical monsters<span lang="en-us">; </span>rather the damage bonus reflects the higher damage many 
    people are seeing. <br>
    <br>
    The Bow does, along with the other Shimmering Isparians, the bonus 300% 
    damage to the dual and triple elemental monsters, such as those found on the 
    Quiddity Ingot and Decanter of Essence quests.<br>
    <br>
    All in all, it is a wonderful bow that is well balanced and now is my 
    primary choice in battle!<br>

    Thank you very much for the compliments. I will tell you a secret. I add the 
    punctuation in!! Sometimes I leave the letters just as written for effect,

    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I was wondering if you'd be willing to update the Quiddity Weapons quest 
    page to state that the <span lang="en-us">Q</span>uiddity <span lang="en-us">
    D</span>agger is capable of multi-strike. It came 
    as a great su<span lang="en-us">r</span>prise to me to find out that I didn't go on that quest just for 
    the uber loot. ;p Upon testing it out on some hapless victims on Marae 
    Lassel, I immediat<span lang="en-us">e</span>ly starting putting the smack on them with double slashes; 
    it is unknown at this time if it can do triple strike, because my dagger 
    skill isn't that high.<br>
    <br>
    I figure it may be important to mention on that page because other dagger 
    users may choose not to go on that quest because maybe they'd think the 
    dagger would be useless to them (like I originally thought).<br>

        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Hi Cyrriss -<br>
        If you create a 2nd character to hold your extra stuff, you can mule in 
        one of several ways. If you own a house or residential quarters with a 
        storage chest, give your mule storage access, put your item in the 
        chest, log out, then log on with your mule to retrieve the item. </font>
        </span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">If you don't have storage, 
        you can do one of two things. You can either put the item on the ground 
        where you mule is logged out, then log out and log your mule in to pick 
        it up, or you can ask a trusted 3rd party to hold the item for you until 
        you can log your mule on. Both these methods involve risk. The item on 
        the ground could decay or could be picked up by someone else who happens 
        to see it lying there unattended. If you choose the wrong person to hold 
        your stuff, they may not give it back. You can minimize your risk by 
        muling in a secluded, out of the way location, or by choosing a trusted 
        friend to help you. Good luck!</font></span></p>

        Thanks for the info on the orb and glad you like the site. To answer 
        your question about the Monarchy listing, I have a page which explains where people can 
        send preliminary information. After I receive the request, I will be in touch with the monarchies to 
        gather additional data a few weeks before I plan to feature that 
        particular monarchy. I intended to try and publish one a week, but 
        that may not be realistic with my current crazy work schedule. Right 
        now, as usual, I have an enormous back-log that I need to try and get 
        finished and up. </span></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">To have a greater chance of

        extra time tracking down the missing information myself. If you gather

        published sooner rather than later. Hope that answers your question. My

    <br>
    Sadly, I did not get *my* invite to beta either. It would be cool if I could 
    get a slot. I'd like to continue the Maggie/Ned partnership in AC2 beta! 
    Remember the fun we had in AC1 beta, watching the comet de<span lang="en-us">s</span>troy the world? 
    Ahhh, those were the days.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I thought I'd review my beta qualifications, just in case a Turbine 
    beta-picker is reading: 1) I provided wonderful, useful service in AC1 beta. 
    My thoughtful bug reports were specific and easily replicated. A few people 
    said so! 2) I have a cranky old-timey computer (Pentium II) with lots of ram 
    and a weirdo (ATI 32 meg PCI) video card and a cranky dial up connection. 
    All *made* for beta testing. Some good should come from such a pile of ...<br>

    Here's hoping we can continue our adventures in the new AC2 Dereth. Until 
    then, I'll be huddled in my house here in AC1 awaiting word. (Wiggles PCI

    Microsoft --&nbsp;<br>
    About a year ago I sat on a high cliff-edge by the sea, with my companion 
    and Monarch Maggie the Jackcat, and watched&nbsp;a comet descending, as we waited 
    for the world (of beta) to end.&nbsp;It was sad, but Turbine promised that&nbsp;the 
    best was yet to come.&quot;</span></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">It's certainly a 
    promise kept. Who would ever have thought those early days of beta, with my 
    crappy computer and my crappy graphics, would have inspired my kick-ass 
    fabulous AC site? I'm certainly looking forward to many more happy days with 
    you in the Dereth of the future. That is, if we ever get there. *sigh*

    <p>Just saw the ACPL pics and stuff. Nice to see all the R/L faces! Will 
        you marry me? Ok ok, got that out of the way...*grin*... Always wanted 
        to compliment you on your fine website and this is a great time to do it 
        I guess. Thanks for all the good work and for the ACPL reporting. Best

    You are a babe. <span lang="en-us">A</span>nd I thought you were really a snot nosed 14 year old 
    kid.<br>
    <br>
    I am jealous of Ned. In fact I want to be Ned.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, take care<span lang="en-us">.</span> I enjoy all the stuff on your fab site.<br>

    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Kared Tung-Po -<br>
    Thank you very much. I am definitely not 14! Ha. Out of all the letters I 
    got about the ACPL or the subsequent write-up, this was one of my favorites. 
    Ned thought it was very funny too! He kept repeating under his breath, &quot;In 
    fact I want to be Ned,&quot; and heh-heh-ing to himself in a self-satisfied 
    manner. ;-) </span></font></p>
