    to me asking why I didn't list the most important stat of the Bow: the
    damage modifier! Well, when I first did the page, lo many moons ago, the
    damage modifier was not visible! Archers would have to complete complicated
    field tests to gauge whether they had a decent weapon or not. So until I

    </b>Yet two more <a href="../../Apparel/Armor.htm"> Armor</a> sections updated:
    <a href="../../Apparel/Girth.htm">Girths</a> and <a href="../../Apparel/Greave.htm">Greaves</a>.
    Thank goodness for <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Zenk.htm">Zenk's
    Runway</a> page, or I would barely have had any Greaves examples for the
    Random Loot Generated Section! ;-) I also realized that although I had been
    updating the elemental protections from the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Ways2.htm">Changing
    of the Ways</a> metal armor love, I had forgotten the changed values and
    burdens. I *knew* the Horned Helm burden was 666! Stats for the store-bought
    armor on the previously updated pages have now been corrected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I've also finally finished going through all
    the email with housing coordinates. <a href="../../Directory/RECoords.htm">Real
    Estate Coordinates</a> page updated accordingly. If you don't see the
    housing locations you sent in, please resend them. Thanks!</font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>October 3, 2001<br>
    </b>Two more <a href="../../Apparel/Armor.htm"> Armor</a> sections updated:
    <a href="../../Apparel/Feet.htm">Feet</a> and <a href="../../Apparel/Gauntlet.htm">Gauntlets</a>.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a>
    updated! Maggie talks about one of her favorite subjects: herself! (j/k, I
    actually talk about the site) Other topics include: When Monarchs Cry, and a
    Big Fat Thank You from Maggie the Jackcat.</font></p>
    <p>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>October 2, 2001<br>
    </b>Two more Armor sections updated: <a href="../../Apparel/Coat.htm">Coats/Hauberks</a>
    and <a href="../../Apparel/Cuirass.htm">Cuirass</a>.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">By request, I've also added a Tip Jar for the
    site. Use the button to the right to send me money via Amazon's Honor System
    or Paypal! An <a href="../Tips.htm">About the
    Tip Jar</a> page added as well.</font></p>

    </b>Finally, on my third attempt, I retrieved the Blood of the Hopeslayer
    from the Remnants of Ilservian in the Sepulcher of the Hopeslayer! Thanks to
    DaMonchary under <a href="../../WhereNow/Danier.htm">Danier</a> for the grand
    adventure! Read about it in the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SoLH.htm">Sword
    of Lost Hope</a> quest write-up! Includes <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SoLH2.htm">fabulous
    screenshots</a>!</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I've also started the long overdue updating
    of the <a href="../../Apparel/Armor.htm">Armor</a> section in response to
    countless requests for cross-links to the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm">Quest</a>
    section or the <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Crafters.htm">Crafters &amp;
    Collectors</a> page. The quest/crafted items have been separated out, as
    have the store-bought items. As before, I've still included a sampling of
    the randomly generated items to show the wide variety of items available in
    the game. <a href="../../Apparel/Bracer.htm">Bracers</a>, <a href="../../Apparel/Breast.htm">Breastplates</a>,
    <a href="../../Apparel/Head.htm">Head</a> and <a href="../../Apparel/Shield.htm">Shield</a>
    pages completed so far.</font></p>
