      </strong><small>Several people have written to me asking me to put a <a href="../Search.htm">search
      engine</a> on the site. I've added a link to one on the <a href="../../index.htm">Home</a>
      page. However, I haven't tested it at all yet, so if it doesn't work, give
      me a few days to tweak it, before sending me mail!&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Speaking of mail, I realized I
      hadn't updated the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters Section</a> in forever.
      That's because, of course, I am still so behind answering mail. But I am
      catching up, slowly but surely. I am only two weeks back instead of
      three!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I also added the base stats for the Medium Shadow Amuli on the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
      Armor</a> page.</small></font></p>

      </strong><small>I sent out a newsletter a few days ago, but didn't put the
      last edition up on the web as I usually do. It's up now! You can find the

      as well as links to other past newsletters on the lower right of this

      the Table</a> page was updated with a few more colorful selections of
      Dinnerware.</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>A selection of Rapiers was
      finally added to the <a href="../../Sports/sword.htm">Swords</a> page.</small></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Other site additions: I've
      update the <a href="../../Culture/culture.htm">Culture Section</a> with many
      of the new texts from the latest patch. I also added Dave Javier's Zone
      story on Mosswarts. You can find them in the <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Texts.htm">Texts
      Section</a>.</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>And you can really tell how long
      it's been since I updated by the rise in my vassal's Death Stats. Up FIFTY
      to 530. Working off his vitae has sent so much experience my way, that it
      turns out I haven't earned ANY AT ALL myself!!&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>We stumbled across this bug the
      other day, realizing that my total experience was 50K LESS than the
      experience my vassal had supposedly earned for me. That's just not right!

      mail, but am still about 3 weeks behind. I'm also sorry to say that I'm
      going to have to stop taking volunteers for the Runway. I have such a line
      backed up that I probably won't get everyone up until 2003. :)</font></p>

      Harvestgain, I've added a page on <a href="../../Hobbies/Potions.htm">Potions</a>,
      including the new Dispel Potions! I also slightly modified the Alchemical <a href="../../Hobbies/formulas.htm">Formulas</a>
      page, moving the Draughts over to the Potions page.</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I've had a request to display
      the icons with the Alchemical Formulas and will try to revise the page

      one of the most sought after and valuable items in the game. I can't thank
      you enough, Danier, for supplying my special vassal with such a prize! You
      are SO COOL!! :)<br>
