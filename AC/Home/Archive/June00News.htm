    </strong><small>What better addition for a beautiful summer day than a <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a> feature in deep blue and bright gold! See <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Gheres.htm">Gheres Reficul</a> in his handsome Amuli suit!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Gheres recently sent me some screenshots of the
    Advocate Dungeon when he stumbled across it. I've added a page in the <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/oddsends.htm">Odds &amp; Ends</a> Section giving a brief
    introduction to the <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/advocates.htm">Advocates &amp; Sentinels</a>.
    Really, I just wanted a place to put up pics of those cool shields!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> Section
    also updated. Finally, some criticism! :)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 27, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Ever wonder why Maggie the Jackcat doesn't have Message Boards? Find out
    in the updated <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> section!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Again, I apologize to the rest of you whose mail
    I have yet to answer. More coming soon! (Maggie's favorite line :)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 25, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>It's <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/GreenFlash.htm">The Green Flash</a>!
    Fabulous new Runway addition. Check it out!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>It's the same sad tale. Work, work, work. And
    more work. *sigh* Once again, I'm behind answering mail. Responses coming soon!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 22, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New Spells! I think the news is out, but in case you missed it, A'zeal was
    one of the first to cast some of the new War Spells from the June Patch. Congratulations
    to all the mages who participated in the exciting research!! No pics here,&nbsp; but check
    out <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">CoD</a> for more news!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>New <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a> addition! Archer From Hell shows
    off his Koujia Armor and fancy bow. Check it out <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Archer.htm">here</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I've also started the updating of the burden
    stats for the <a href="../../Shopping/4Table.htm">For the Table</a> page. Cups, Plates,
    Ewers, Chalices and Goblets show their lighter stats in yellow.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Ned Cleversun's death total up a whopping 21 to
    310. Loyalty up four to 113! Thanks Ned! The <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> section
    also has an additional comment in response to some criticism from my vassal.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 19, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Maggie the Jackcat's Irregular AC News went out yesterday. I've archived
    the previous May 23, 2000 edition on the web. Link is to the right. If you'd like to sign
    up for the newsletter, click <a href="../Newsletter.htm" target="_top">here</a>.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 15, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I've had several letters recently reminding me of the addition of <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hamud.htm">Oswald's Dagger</a> to the end of the Katar quest.
    I've finally updated the page, plus<em> finally</em> corrected the remaining misspellings
    of Devena's name! Because the screen shot page I did for the Silifi quest turned out to be
    quite popular, I've done up a <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/HPK2.htm">similar page</a> for
    Hamud's Pyreal Katar / Oswald's Dagger. All pics courtesy of Danier!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> updated.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 14, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New addition on the Runway! It's been weeks since we met to do the pics,
    but here they are, finally. <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Roberto.htm">Roberto-Eduardo</a>
    is up on the Runway, along with his finely dressed mule!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added one more new <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Ulgrim.htm">Ulgrim</a> rumor. Thanks to Veritus Venatus for
    the info!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Ned Cleversun's death total is up by 22, and his loyalty is up by 1 to 109.
    Congratulations on reaching level 39, Ned Cleversun. Could you, maybe, slow up a bit and
    wait for me?!! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 13, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Just a quick addition to the site today. Added a new <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Ulgrim.htm">Ulgrim the Unpleasant Rumor</a> about the
    pronunciation of the new server. I guess I'll have to wait for the <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/gathering/" target="_blank">AC Player Luncheon</a>,
    sponsored by the Crossroads Gaming Network, to know for sure!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added Dark Revenant Thighbone and a few more
    rumored dungeon Coordinates to the the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Paths2.htm">Paths of
    Destruction</a> pages.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 11, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Ned Cleversun gets tweaked! The fabulous <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Danier.htm">Danier</a>, mage extraordinaire, updgraded Ned's
    outfit as a favor to me. Add a great new bow from Vilegoroth, and Ned was ready to conquer
    the Dires! Of course, he's since had a run of bad luck (which included a 37% vitae), but
    that's a story for another day. Read about Ned's trip to Goodwill in the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters Section</a> and see <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Ned2.htm">his
    new gear</a> up on the Runway!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Thanks to Loki the Lucky, I've also included a <a href="../Letters.htm">Letter</a> which gives some great info on the Lugian Sinews for the
    new bow quest. I'll be doing a full quest guide in the near future, but I don't want to
    spoil it for everyone yet! The industrious and clever must have their day!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the new <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Paths2.htm">Paths of Destruction</a> page with a few more bits
    of information.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 10, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Letters updated! I've had lots of mail asking me about the accuracy of the
    Diamond Golem stats, so thought I'd toss one up on the <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters
    Section</a>! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 9, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Once again, that dratted job I have is keeping me from the game and from
    updating the site. (Maggie the Jackcat sometimes works very looooooong hours.) I have
    added some info to the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Paths2.htm">Paths of Destruction</a>
    section, including the stats of some of the new Banderlings (thanks once again to Danier),
    and more dungeon listings (not all verified).</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Ned Cleversun's Death total continues to rise!
    Welcome to the Dires, Ned!!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I'm veeeerrrryyy behind on answering all the
    mail I've received lately. Thanks to all for your letters, suggestions, Runway volunteers,
    pics, news, etc! I will try to set aside some time in the next day or so to respond to you
    personally and to set up some times to snap some pics of&nbsp; the outfits for the Runway
    folks! I apologize for not answering the mail sooner. As I've said before, It doesn't mean
    I don't love you! :)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 7, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Town Crier tells you, &quot;There are tidings of new dungeons that have
    been discovered!&nbsp; I wish I could quit my job and go explore!&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Me too!! This pesky job I have kept me
    super-busy all day. I couldn't download the patch until almost 10:30 at night! And I was
    soooo tired I fell asleep during the download. Haha. But, I was able to log on for a bit
    in the wee hours of the AM (saw some of my buddies still hard at it!!)</small> <small>to
    compile a little info to offer to you!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>See a partial list of the new content <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Paths2.htm">here</a>! <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Rumors.htm">Town Crier Rumors</a> also updated! Cheeky,
    cheeky, cheeky.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Thanks to Danier, Warhavik<small>,</small>
    Pigroast II, &amp; Ned Cleversun for sending me info and cool pics of the new stuff! And,
    of course, thanks to Turbine for raising the bar! This is one totally kick-ass game!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 5, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I check my stats pretty regularly to see what pages are the most popular.
    The <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/PvP.htm">PvP</a> page under <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/oddsends.htm">Odds &amp; Ends</a> gets huge numbers of hits. But
    it's been empty, with a &quot;Coming Soon&quot; notice for months! Soon has arrived! I've
    compiled a small list of links relating to Darktide &amp; PvP.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>I also added the fountains, etc. which cast Revitalize I under the <a href="../../Shopping/Pharmacy.htm">Pharmacy</a> page in the <a href="../../Shopping/shopping.htm">Shopping</a> Section. I originally was compiling
    coodinates for them, but decided that wasn't necessary! They're in all the towns and
    starter outposts.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Paths.htm">Paths of Destruction</a> page under the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm">Dereth History</a> Section in anticipation of the
    latest event!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Did some minor housekeeping, updated a few icons
    and stats, corrected some spelling errors, revised a few introductions.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>June 4, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New Quest! Well, it's not really new, but it's new on my Jackcat site.
    I've finally put the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SoCS.htm" target="_top">Silifi of Crimson Stars</a> quest up in the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm" target="_top">Quest Section</a>.
    It's a modified version of the one I did for <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">Crossroads of Dereth</a> a while ago. But this one has <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SoCS2.htm" target="_top">fabulous screen
    shots</a> provided by Brian Boru', Axeman of Harvestgain and my main research man! Thanks
    Brian Boru'! Sorry it took me so long to show them off!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions</small><br>
    <small><a href="May00News.htm" target="_top">May
    New Stuff</a> page has been archived (link to the right) and the <a href="OldLetters_TOC.htm" target="_top">May
    Letters</a> have also been archived. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Ned Cleversun's loyalty inches forward. He's
    added two more point to put the stat at 108! Alas, his death total has taken an even
    bigger jump -- up 26 to 252!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>New <a href="../Letters.htm" target="_top">Letters</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>And I'm proud to announce that <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Maggie.htm" target="_top">Maggie the
    Jackcat</a> is now Level 23!! Yay! It's the new gear, I'm certain of it. (Or the result of
    tons of exp from my vassal as he works off TWENTY-SIX deaths worth of vitae.)</small></font></td>
