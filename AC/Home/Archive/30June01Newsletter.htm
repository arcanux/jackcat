      CROSSROADS OF DERETH RETURNS! YAY!<br>
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      "I want my CoD!!!" Who knew just how much we would all miss the demise of a site 
      as the community did when CoD was suddenly gone. No searchable Atlas, no Hall of 
      Lore, no Creature data base, no "Big List", no Quest Guides, no Trade Skills, no 
      Compendium, no Library, no boards, no up-to-the-minute news, no nuttin. Just a big 
      sad "Page not found."<br>
      <br>
      But thanks to our fearless leader, Allen Grey, and a new joint venture with the 
      people at Warcry, Crossroads of Dereth has returned, under new management, and 
      even better than before! Allen and Veritus are back at the helm, and the staff 
      have all returned, frantically working behind the scenes for the last few weeks 
      to get things ready for the launch. The site has been infused with a bunch of new 
      blood, bringing a new level of excitement and energy to the endeavor. The hilarious 
      Kwip, of
      <a href="http://www.neenerneener.net" target="_blank"> http://www.neenerneener.net</a> 
      fame, is CoD's newest Columnist! The sanguine Topheron was recruited to head the 
      Library section, and a host of new moderators have joined the staff to keep the 
      boards, once again, one of the best and most intelligent places to discuss our shared 
      pastime: this wonderful game of Asheron's Call!<br>
      <br>
      Welcome Back Crossroads of Dereth! And welcome back Allen Grey! Yay!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      *throws confetti*&nbsp;<br>
      *pops the champagne*<br>
      *sets off fireworks*<br>
      <br>
      The new management was able to secure the xrgaming domains. All bookmarks and links 
      should once again work. You can visit Crossroads of Dereth here:

      AC EXPANSION PACK - DARK MAJESTY<br>
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      You've probably heard the news, but just in case.... Microsoft has announced the 
      upcoming release of an expansion pack for Asheron's Call, scheduled for the Christmas 
      Holiday season. From the official press release:<br>
      <br>
      "The Expansion Pack delivers on new additions such as housing and storage, two of 
      the features most requested by our customers. Players will be able to purchase their 
      own homes on designated plots of land, as well as use their residence for secure 
      storage purposes. The Expansion Pack also kicks off the next chapter in the ongoing 
      Asheron's Call storyline by introducing the island of Marae Lassel. Marae Lassel is 
      a sprawling new landmass which will contain new quests, dungeons, and treasures which 
      will all be accessible to all levels of players who purchase the Asheron's Call 
      Expansion Pack. "<br>

      ACPL APPROACHING FAST!<br>
      ----------------------------------------------------------<br>
      The 2nd Annual Asheron's Call Player Luncheon (scheduled for July 14th) is 
      approaching fast! Allen Grey recently announced that there are less than 20 
      seats left. If you haven't registered yet, do it NOW!! :) The schedule of events 
      is shaping up, with a welcome address by Allen Grey &amp; Nik "Azeraphel" Davidson. 
      Turbine's CEO, Jeff Anderson, has also graciously agreed to speak. Ken Troop will 
      be talking about Designing Asheron's Call and there will be a question and answer 
      session with some of the Turbine staff. And, once again, we'll see a return of the 
      hilarious "Whose Drudge Is It Anyway?" competition. Please consider joining us all 
      in Boston for this fun-filled day!<br>

      MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS AC SITE NEWS!<br>
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      First off, I'd just like to take a quick minute to comment on several emails I've 
      received, asking me if the rumors they've heard about my site going down are true. 
      I don't have a clue where this rumor could have started, but no, it's not true. Even 
      though I do work on the CoD staff, my Jackcat site is not affiliated in any way with 
      Warcry or the xrgaming network. CoD going down had no effect on my Jackcat site, 
      whatsoever. Some may have also heard me mention that as my traffic continues to increase, 
      the costs to host the site have also continued to increase. This is true. The site is 
      substantially more expensive to run than when I first made it public. At this time, 
      however, the costs are still manageable and I don't foresee a crisis any time in the 
      near future. The decision to not have boards has helped tremendously in keeping the 
      costs down. (As a side note to all you eBay-ers who are linking to images on my site, 
      please STOP immediately. I pay for that bandwidth.)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Now on to more fun things! Maggie the Jackcat was recently interviewed by the fine 
      folks at Double Gold. Read all about my sex symbol status ;-) and what I like to eat 
      for breakfast here:

      <br>
      Thanks once again to all my visitors and thanks especially for all the cool screens 
      and info you send! And just because I can't keep up with the mail, please don't stop 
      sending it! Th <a href="../Letters.htm"> Letters</a> section (which needs updating, I know!) 
      continues to be extremely popular. Let your wit and wisdom shine. :-)
      <a href="../../Ned/Intro.htm"> Ned Cleversun's Sermons Essays &amp; Tips</a> has received 
      a great reception as well. Look for more of my wonderful vassal's writings soon.<br>
      <br>
      Site stats continue their trend of a steady rise, with between 7500-10000 unique 
      visitor sessions a day.<br>
      <br>
      And, as always, more coming soon! ;-)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      See you in the game!&nbsp;<br>
