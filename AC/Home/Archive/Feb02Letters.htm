        but you probably have the best AC site on the web. Would be great to 
        have the same thing for AC2. Looking at the previews, I suspect a large

    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi <span lang="en-us">Bow Spirit</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">Funny you should ask. My vassal and I were *just* 
    talking about this last night. It's a big decision. Luckily, it's one I 
    don't have to make right away. The game is still months and months and 
    months and months away from being released. I know the hype is out there 
    fast and furious, and that's nice to see. But I don't feel the need to dive 
    in until I know I'm fully committed to the long-term effort it would 
    require. My kick-ass AC site didn't even make an appearance until a few 
    months after retail, after all. I do, of course, have some ideas that I'm 
    kicking around, and am giving it some serious thought. There's all kinds of 
    things to consider: time and money to name just a few. And what if I don't 
    even *like* the game?? *sigh* It sure would be a LOT easier for me to make 
    this kind of important decision if I could, say, check it out in BETA ahead 
    of time!!!! ;-)</span></font></p>

    <p>
    <font color="#FFFF99"><br>
    Hi <span lang="en-us">Ryu Sakoi</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">Glad you like the site! For the first question: no. 
    You cannot do the Queen quest solo. Second, Maggie the Jackcat's Kick-Ass 
    Fabulous AC Web Site will not have forums. I've actually answered this 
    question many times before, but it's topical again and worth another look. 
    My vassal often gives his opinion about the strengths of my site. For one, 
    it has a unified voice. There's a coherence to the information because it's 
    all filtered through one person (me). And the filtering process is an 
    important one. There's a certain art to weeding through 2,000 emails each 
    month and presenting the data in an entertaining, readily understandable 
    fashion. (Ok, ok. I confess. I've only weeded through 1200 of the 2000 for 
    Feb. and still have 800 to go! :)<br>
    <br>
    Another strength is its positive spin. Let's face it: boards can be 
    depressing! &quot;Turbine SUXORS! The game SUX! YOU Suck! Blah, blah, blah.&quot; I 
    feel that there are already ample opportunities for these viewpoints to be 
    expressed on the web. I choose, instead, to celebrate the fun of the game, 
    and the fun that players are having in the game. As my vassal likes to say, 
    &quot;Other sites have 'Community'; your site has players.&quot; Third, forums are 
    extremely time consuming and require constant vigilance. Although the world 
    is full of wonderful, engaging people, I'm familiar enough with the Internet 
    to understand that the occasional butt-head who sends me anonymous hate mail 
    because I once told them to quit stealing content from my site would not be 
    able to resist stopping by for a visit. I'm really too busy to do the 
    moderation forums would require. Plus, they're expensive. Huge bandwidth 
    hogs. </span></font></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">So why then, am I giving the 
    subject a second look here? </font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Because I've been considering 
    whether to do an AC2 site, and in considering, thinking about what sort of 
    site that would be, if I did one. Would I have a news page? Would I have 
    forums? My vassal thinks that the only way forums would be workable would be 
    for me to be totally non-involved in the administration. He says it's 
    because he knows me. He knows me well enough to understand I would be unable 
    to resist mixing it up on my own forums. And that I would be unable to act 
    right! It's true. I would get into rip-roaring fights and arguments and 
    flame fests and would ban everyone! NO mercy! He says the only way it would 
    work would be if I would turned over full control to someone like... say... 
    him! I know he's an old hand at this Internet thing, but I suspect this is 
    just a blatant power play! ;-)</font></span></p>

    <span lang="en-us">I AM THE BUNNY MASTER!!!!</span></b></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">Dear Maggie -<br>
        Love the site. I was actually really happy when I saw my name on the 
        Special thanks for bunny slippers. Well anyway, I got a little story to 
        tell you. I was really bored yesterday and wanted to do a simple quest. 
        I decided I didn't like my title and wanted to get another one (Gardener 
        Weeder was yucky). So I looked at your site and at the titles. I didn't 
        want to get one of the ones you bought because something life &quot;Life 
        Caster&quot; is really dumb. And then I saw it on your quest list: &quot;Bunny 
        Master Title.&quot; I thought, &quot;whoa,&quot; Bunny Master -- that would be an 
        awesome title. I wrote down the coords but then I saw the little note.
        <i>Note: Larry the Rabbit Master is frequently broken and may not spawn.</i> 
        I wasn't as excited anymore and even though I was really bored, I just 
        set out for the coords anyway. Hey, maybe I would get lucky (which I 
        usually don't).</span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">SO, I headed off, and as I got nearer I saw the 
        lifestone. Then I went to the cottage nearby and got the purchasing 
        info. Then I saw him -- Larry the Bunny Master in all his glory. I 
        buffed up and gave him his purchasing info back and got portalled 
        straight to this garden. While I was in his garden, I couldn't find his 
        bunnies. I thought NOOO there is probably something wrong. Then I found 
        'em. Six little (Well not so little. Those things were the size of 5 
        bunnies) Grimacing Bunnies. I got ready to strike and after about 15 
        minutes I was sent back to the lifestone. Yup that's it. The last rabbit 
        knocked me down for my 398th death. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">I was really upset and mad at myself. I had told 
        my friend about it and he was 5 steps ahead of me going to see Larry. 
        When I finally got back to him the purchase info hadn't respawned and I 
        was getting ready to leave. Meanwhile, my friend had killed his share of 
        6 bunnies, including the one I injured. Then a message came up soon 
        after. You have been given a new title. I appraised myself and saw my 
        new title. Bunny Master. I jumped up for joy and was so happy. I went 
        back in to get my body and came out. I was jumping for joy. I just had 
        to do quest again. So after about 15 minutes I picked up the info and 
        went back. This time there were 6 nasty rabbits. I burned those suckers 
        so fast. I went back to see Larry again and it said I had received a new 
        title. Bunny master again. So later that day I was talking to a 
        different friend. He wanted to do quest and he went on it. He became a 
        Bunny Master too. The main reason why I'm telling you this is because I 
        think the bunny master title quest is now fully operational. SO you can 
        take down that upsetting note.<i> Note: Larry the Rabbit Master is 
        frequently broken and may not spawn</i>. It was an easy and fun quest 
        and I truly am THE BUNNY MASTER!!!<br>

        probably want some spells to buff your weapon, like Blood Drinker, or 
        Heart Seeker. And, yes, one of the main reasons people get Item Magic is 
        so they can recall. These spells give you the ability to move around 
        Dereth more easily. I'm lifestoned in Arwic, for example. When I cast 
        lifestone recall, I am teleported to the Arwic lifestone, no matter 
        where I cast the spell from. Out of my element in a dungeon, severely 
        overburdened and surrounded by terrible creatures? Instead of dying, I 
        can't just recall out to safety! Swoosh! Safe at the lifestone, without 
        dying. It's very slick.</font></span></p>

    I love your page! I have been playing Leafcull for about 2 years now and

    what items are no-drop on death, especially magic casting items. I was 
    wondering if you ever considered adding another line to any of your item 
    pages that specifies drop/non drop on death. Maybe you could even abbreviate 
    it in the comments section. It is probably too much work just for us DT 
    players, but it would be very helpful. Keep up all the good work!<br>

        think the information would be useful for all the servers, not just DT. 
        But even if it was only for DT, that would still be reason enough for

    <span lang="en-us">Mad Star Drudges... (and some other things, too)</span></b><br>
    <br>
    I just recently got hooked on running around, doing the starter quests with 
    my level 9 character. Of course, then I found out that about 90% of the 
    starter quests were for levels 1-6 - especially all the COOL quests! *grump* 
    Anyway, looking at your starter quests pages helped keep me from running 
    around on a quest just to find that the dungeon was level-restricted - I 
    could look ahead and see which ones I could actually do :) I was looking at 
    the Yaraq starter quest page, and I noticed the bit under 'Drudge 
    Translation'. I read through the translated note, and it kinda made sense to 
    me - my AC lore isn't too great, but I seem to remember that the Altered 
    Drudges (which I shudder to meet) were in fact altered by Virindi, or 
    Shadows or one of them baddies, though my best guess is Virindi. Based on 
    that, my guess is that the Virindi took some of the drudges living near that 
    'Mad Star' (only the star wasn't there yet) and altered them; the new 
    Altered Drudges liked the changes, and so they wrote a note to their f<span lang="en-us">riends.</span><br>
    <br>
    I don't know whether I'm right or not, but, well, I thought it was a good 
    theory :P I'll let you decide, though :D<br>

    we emailed you, and since Dad never submits anything, I think it hit<span lang="en-us">
    </span>him kinda hard when you didn't believe him<span lang="en-us">.</span> 
    I know I got kinda upset :blush: I'm not trying to complain, really -<span lang="en-us">-</span> 
    if everyone else who submitted it was thought to be frauds, it only makes 
    sense for Dad to be thought that way, too. What I *am* doing is saying thank 
    you for putting it up when it finally was acknowledged - it made both Dad 
    and I feel really great to see the TARDIS listed on *the* Maggie Jackcat's 
    page as being really real. :) (well, in-game real, anyway. :D)<br>
    <br>
    Well, I guess that's finally it :D thanks for running the site - I always 
    check it on patch day, and about one out of every three days in between 
    patches :) Your site is the coolest! <br>

    <p>Hi :)<br>
    <br>
    After playing AC for a LONG time<span lang="en-us">, I</span> think that 
    this is the best patch ever. There are so many new things to do<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
    but everyone already knows that<span lang="en-us">. I</span> wanted to say 
    that the dungeons for the <span lang="en-us">H</span>elm of
    <span lang="en-us">the E</span>lements are the coolest thing ever. Since
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> hit about level 35<span lang="en-us">, I</span> 
    was looking for a good place to fight <span lang="en-us">O</span>lthoi. OHN 
    was way t<span lang="en-us">o</span>o camped and d<span lang="en-us">e</span>spite 
    its reputation<span lang="en-us">, A</span>cid <span lang="en-us">V</span>ault 
    is still not t<span lang="en-us">o</span>o incredible spawns. But the 
    starting part of the <span lang="en-us">H</span>elm of <span lang="en-us">E</span>lements 
    quest is perfect. <span lang="en-us">I</span> enc<span lang="en-us">o</span>urage 
    people to look at it as not just a place to go to do a quest<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
    but a place to hang out. I don<span lang="en-us">'</span>t ever go to the 
    part of the quest with the golems because it kinda ruins the quest if 
    someone is camping the golems... (not like <span lang="en-us">I</span> can 
    camp them anyways)<span lang="en-us">. </span>But <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    just wanted to say that everyone should check out thos<span lang="en-us">e</span> 
    places. <br>

        <span lang="en-us">I agree! Best... patch... ever! (At least until next

    <span lang="en-us"><b>Site Feature Wanted</b></span></p>
    <p>If you could make a message board type of section which is meant for 
    TEMPLATES, that would be a major part of your website. It can simply be done 
    by making a message board where the messages have required fields of Race, 
    Gender, Skills/Specd, Skills/Train. The reason I want this on your site is 
    because it would be useful for people who want to find a good template. 
    There could be a rating section for each template that people submit, where 
    visitors can rate how well the template works out. Anyway you could make it 
    work a lot better<span lang="en-us">;</span> I haven't thought of the 
    details on how it would work yet...<br>
    <br>
    Maggie's site is the BOMB<span lang="en-us">,</span> that's why I want this 
    awesome feature to be on the best AC site in the world!!!!

    Newby (or newbie) is actually a nickname for a new arrival to the game -- a 
    new player. There is no quest called the &quot;newby quest.&quot; Instead, you'll 
    often hear the starter quests referred to as &quot;newbie quests&quot; because you can 
    only do them when you're levels 1-6 or maybe 1-9. After you get through the 
    Training Academy, pay attention to the next direction you're given and that 
    should get you started (they'll usually tell you to find another NCP to talk 
    to - non player character). Good luck, and welcome to Dereth!</span></font></p>

    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi <span lang="en-us">Mats</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">Yes! Yes, I *do* know! Upon hearing your discovery, I 
        immediately had a hunch! But how to prove it? Maggie can't cook! I was 
        actually in the Vesayen Isles at the time, scouring the area for nutmeg. 
        As I calculated my chances of escaping yet another Zefir attack, I spied 
        a portal to Mayoi. I decided nutmeg could wait, but the carrot cake 
        could not! I stopped at the grocer intending to test my little theory. 
        While there, Kelindil and Little Tak stopped by to say hello. I asked if 
        either of them could cook. Little Tak said his mule Thories Trade Mule 
        had cooking; he would bring him on! Demon Slaughter, who happened to be 
        wandering by, volunteered to buff Thories. Realizing we had no egg, 
        Kelindil popped down to the beaches to kill some critters. We had a 
        plan! </span></font></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Sadly, none of us were well 
        versed in the art of cooking! I read off the recipe to Thories Trade 
        Mule. </font><br>
        You say, &quot;water on flour&quot;<br>
        <font color="#FFFF99">I heard a gulping sound as Thories Trade Mule 
        drained the flask of its liquid!</font><br>
        You say, &quot;er... flour on water? Haha.&quot;<br>
        <font color="#FFFF99">Just then, Kelindil ran in with our egg! She 
        handed it to me and I gave it to Thories.<br>
        </font>You say, &quot;ok doh on egg&quot;<br>
        Demon Slaughter says, &quot;mmmmm eggs&quot;<br>
        <font color="#FFFF99">A crunching sound emitted from the vicinity of 
        Thories' mouth. Uh oh!</font><br>
        Thories Trade Mule says, &quot;SH%&amp;&quot;<br>
        Thories Trade Mule says, &quot;lol&quot;<br>
        Demon Slaugther says, &quot;lol&quot;<br>
        You say, &quot;Hahaha.&quot;<br>
        Demon Slaughter says, &quot;doh on egg&quot;<br>
        Demon Slaughter says, &quot;not egg in mouth lol&quot;<br>
        Thories Trade Mule says, &quot;LOL...NOT EGG ON DOH&quot;<br>
        Kelindil says, &quot;oh lol&quot;<br>
        You say, &quot;LOL&quot; <br>
        <font color="#FFFF99">As Kelindil ran to the beach again in search of 
        another egg, I asked if either of them had any milk. I would need it to 
        test my hunch. Demon Slaughter offered to run his mage, who was tied to 
        the hub, to get some. While we waited, Kelindil returned with another 
        egg and we successfully added it to our dough to make batter. After 
        adding a little more flour, then carrots, we were ready to bake! Thories, 
        thank goodness, was unable to eat the baking pan by accident! He 
        produced a delicious piece of carrot cake! </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Things were getting 
        exciting. </font></span><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Ok, I 
        told them, it is time to test the new recipe! I directed Thories to use 
        his knife on the carrot cake! Which knife, he asked? My Intricate 
        Carving Knife? Ooops! We tried a noodle cutter, since the grocer in 
        Mayoi had one, but that didn't do it. Luckily, we were able to catch 
        Demon before he returned and he made a detour through Holtburg to grab a 
        Carving Knife. Sure enough, using the Carving Knife on the Cake produced 
        Carrot Cake Cubes. Jumping up and down with excitement, I asked him to add milk. </span></font></p>
