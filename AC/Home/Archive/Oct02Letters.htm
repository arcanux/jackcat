        <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">Hello Maggie!<br>
        <br>
        Ragoon from FF here again. I think that there is still a<span lang="en-us">
        </span>lot of confusion about what exactly triggers what in the Gaerlan 
        quest, especially since the patch. I<span lang="en-us">'</span>ve done 
        the quest several times, including three times in a row today and I 
        think <span lang="en-us">I</span> have all the triggers down. First the 
        guardian portals. These portals appear a<span lang="en-us">p</span>par<span lang="en-us">ently</span> 
        either randomly or when one of the elementals that is at the essences 
        dies. I was there when the portal spawned and there <span lang="en-us">
        were no</span> named monster or anything like that<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
        so<span lang="en-us"> I</span> believe the &quot;unique creature&quot; from the 
        letter to the players is just one of the elementals that is specially 
        tagged. <br>
        <br>
        <span lang="en-us">A</span>fter the guardian golem is killed, the portal 
        to the guardian lair disappears. It reappears when Gaerlan is killed. So 
        if it<span lang="en-us">'</span>s not around for a long time<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
        it<span lang="en-us">'</span>s probably that someone messed up the quest 
        and it hasn't reset.
        </font></p>
        <p>
        <font face="Arial" size="2">The next issue is when the portal for 
        Gaerlan's dungeon (i.e. Icy Demise, etc.) will spawn, other parts are 
        just for people getting flagged to enter. The portal for these dungeons 
        appear when the portals to their related proving grounds open. So after 
        Gaerlan is killed<span lang="en-us">,</span> the portal for the specific 
        level restricted dungeons wont appear until the Asheron's Platinum Golem 
        gets his pyreal nugget and the appropriate proving ground portal spawns.<br>
        <br>
        Important: Mage flag for getting items is broken this month. My mage 
        friend Gaipan Imperiled, Vulned, Drained, War Cri<span lang="en-us">t</span>ted 
        and festered for two Gaerlan spawns and got nothing. On the third run 
        later that day<span lang="en-us">,</span> he used his racial melee skill 
        and got his items. <br>
        <br>
        *So moral of the story is if you start the quest, finish it. Or else 
        everyone else is going to be waiting for a week or more on that shady 
        Guardian Lair portal*<br>

        Gaerlan's New Improved Sword</b><br>
        <br>
        Since the update it seems Gaerlan has gotten a few new imbued special 
        properties on his Sword in the 60-79 level quest. Instead of just 25-50 
        Human Slayer, it now has Crippling Blow and Armor Rendering on it too! 
        This causes anyone without a shield to get critical for anywhere from 
        100-225 in one of the three swipes of his triple striking sword! </span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">Most of the time if you're caught without a shield 
        and get a crit on you, you rarely see the end of the quest. Melees with 
        a diamond shield with level 7 banes get slaughtered anywhere from 8-30 
        seconds, depending how fast you can heal. Our group died 3 times before 
        we finally made a plan to create a wall of melees and have the archers 
        and mages fire away. The only problem is the melees can't attack or he 
        will attack the wall and everyone is dead in 3 min. You also have to 
        take into account the level 6 imperil usually cast on you by the 
        elementals. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">Since the update, the portal into the loot room 
        stays closed until Gaerlan is dead.... So no more getting your critical 
        hit and running through to the end. Also, there's a portal back into the 
        library now, and be aware there is a timer on how long you can use this 
        portal. A few of our group members were not able to get their quest 
        items because of this. I only know about the new improvements for the 
        60-79 section; I'm not sure if they've changed the other swords in the 
        other dungeons. I think they've added a new and better challenge to the 
        quest now. Love your site! <br>

        <br>
        Well, <span lang="en-us">I </span>just finished the quest using your 
        read-through and I thought it was very good. <span lang="en-us">Here is 
        some information</span> you were missing that helped my group get 
        through it. <span lang="en-us">O</span>n the &quot;Rolling Ball of Death&quot; 
        section, you should add that you are safe on the corners of the 
        intersections because it greatly helps people that have tried to just 
        sprint down the hallway towards the door, :D. Also, that buffing your 
        bow/coordination helps kill the door easier. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the &quot;Gaerlan&quot; section, it would be 
        cool if you added &quot;Tactics,&quot; My group easily beat him with 4 melees, 1 
        archer, and 1 mage. What we did was have 1 melee run down, grab Gaerlan 
        and have him run into the hallway near the entrance. Two melees surround 
        him in his front and his back so he isn't going anywhere. The mage casts 
        Fester Other, Imperil Other, then Vulns. Gaerlan is trapped with an 
        archer gunning him down from the top of the hallway and two melees 
        critically him every<span lang="en-us"> </span>time he turns around.

        <br>
        <br>
        I love your write<span lang="en-us">-</span>ups. Most of the time you've 
        got it so right it's amazing.<br>
        <br>
        However the (admittedly confusing) Citadel quest write<span lang="en-us">-</span>up
        <span lang="en-us">needs</span> some corrections:<br>
        <br>
        - The mountain route is a bug. You won't be able to do that next month. 
        Waiting for the Guardian portals in Eastham will be the only way.<br>
        <br>
        - You can ID the door you're trying to kill. It doesn't regen because of 
        that.<br>
        <br>
        - Trail#4 -- Reverence of the Ceremony<br>
        (First, shouldn't that read &quot;trial&quot; not &quot;trail&quot;?)<br>
        You can run down the stairs. Do not speak or SPELLCAST; I'm not sure 
        about battle mode. We had the most success when we walked in the actual 
        ceremony chamber. If you speak/spellcast in THERE, nasty golems spawn 
        and try to kill you. Sending tells seems to be okay.<br>
        <br>
        - You must complete the Proving Ground trials within 3 hours of giving 
        the nugget to the golem, or you'll no longer be flagged for the Proving 
        Ground portals.<br>
        <br>
        - You can log off in the landing zone in the last dungeon, where you 
        fight Gaerlan.<br>
        <br>
        - You can get the imbued seal and portal gem, and hold onto them for 
        days before using them. If you're having trouble getting a large enough 
        group for your Gaerlan assault together, it's a good idea to do that. If 
        nothing else, you can get another seal and gem after 3 hours (3 hours 
        after picking up the seal pieces, that is), so when you pick things up 
        in a few days you're no WORSE off than trying to kill Gaerlan and 
        failing.<br>
        <br>
        - I recommend you emphasize in the last section (the Kill Gaerlan part) 
        that you make sure you have at least one mage with you, and that this 
        mage is capable of casting Frailty, Imperil, AND slash vuln. We went 
        with someone who could only cast the latter two, and 8 of us couldn't 
        beat on Gaerlan hard enough to reduce his health under 90% without 
        Frailty reducing his regen rate.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks, and keep up the great work! I hope things at your *paying* job 
        let up so you can get back to Dereth!<br>

        Thanks very much for your nice letter. I'm sorry to hear about the

        <br>
        Hi Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Let me, first off, let you know how wonderful your site is. I, 
        personally, feel it is the best AC1 site on the net. It has all the 
        information I need with out all the extraneous cr.. um.. er.. 
        information that all the other sites have. I have been going to your 
        site since it started and have never been disappointed.<br>
        <br>
        I have a mission for you, should you choose to accept it (ignore the 
        music in the background). Something has long been needed and, with the 
        revamping of the loot system, is even more needed now. No-one has ever 
        explored the loot system to any extent and published the information. 
        What<span lang="en-us">'</span>s the highest defen<span lang="en-us">s</span>e 
        mod for a Kat<span lang="en-us">a</span>r? What<span lang="en-us">'</span>s 
        the highest possible damage for a dagger? Can you get <span lang="en-us">
        s</span>trength <span lang="en-us">VI</span> on Sols or only
        <span lang="en-us">c</span>oordination and <span lang="en-us">q</span>uickness? 
        What<span lang="en-us">'</span>s the highest AC for a Covenant 
        Breastplate? What is the damage range for a 270 bow? I am sure you see 
        what I mean. I have been playing since release and I can't answer many 
        of these questions. When I pick up a piece of loot<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
        it may look good at a glance, but without benchmarks to go by<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
        I don't really know. It may be the best sword ever dropped or just 
        something destined for the Ust.<br>
        <br>
        I know that this would be a daunting project, but with the number of 
        your readers and the wealth of information sources you can draw upon, I 
        would think this type of thing would be easier for you then most. <br>
        <br>
        Once again thank<span lang="en-us"> </span>you for your ongoing efforts 
        in AC. People like you make the lives of people like me much easier.<br>

        P.S. I love the new format for your AC2 site. Will you be converting the

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">
        Hi Miss Fortune -<br>
        Actually, that's a project I'd love to work on. I had a really nice

        <font color="#FFFF99">Max Weapon Damage</font></a><font color="#FFFF99"> 
        Table that I worked on for quite a while, and updated it once with game 
        changes, but sadly, the whole thing's way outdated yet again!! I always 
        have to balance updating the site against the free time I have. I wish I 
        had skipped updating the table the last time, because now all that work 
        seems wasted. So, yes, I'd like to work on a project like this again, 
        but I want to wait a bit to see how all the recent changes shake out. If 
        the loot table seems to have settled down after the next update, I'll 
        start the call for info in earnest. </font></span></font></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">About 
        your P.S. no, I plan to keep the AC1 format as it is. It'd be way too 
        much work to make those sorts of changes at this stage. Besides, I still 
        like it!</font></span></p>

        Hi Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Great site you have! I guess your site is one the reasons why I like 
        playing AC1 so much. I am a bit worried though about the future...<span lang="en-us">. 
        I</span>s Maggie going to die when AC2 launches? In other words<span lang="en-us">,
        </span>will your great site still be updated with AC1 news in the 
        future?<br>

        <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi Dark Archer Jaosun -<br>
        I've stated this several times, but it doesn't hurt to repeat it. No, my 
        AC1 site will not die when AC2 launches. I had to give up on the AC2 
        beta and my new AC2 site for a while because of system crashes and 
        uncontrollable vitae, but I intend to keep both the AC1 site and the new 
        AC2 site running when AC2 hits the shelves.</span></font></font></p>

        <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Hi 
        Kristal -<br>
        That's a question many are struggling with right now, indeed! First of 
        all, judging AC2 in its beta state may be premature. As AC has done, I'm 
        sure the game will be continually evolving for the better. You might 
        decide you want to give it a try after it hits the shelves. </font></span></font></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">Even 
        if you do decide to stay with AC1 after many of your friends move on, 
        you won't be alone. Many people won't have a computer that can handle 
        AC2, or they'll prefer the game style of AC1. If your clan breaks down, 
        I'm sure you'll be able to find a home in another allegiance and make 
        new friends. </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF99">It's a 
        tough choice, and one I decided not to make! ;-) I'm just going to play

        Hi Ronin Gibronin -<br>
        Hmm. What a dilemma. It's probably all in the delivery. Maybe if you 
        tried dropping shards and high level loot you'd have more success with 
        the ladies. Er... just kidding! ;-)</font></span></p>
