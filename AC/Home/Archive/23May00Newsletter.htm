    NEW QUEST SECTION ON CROSSROADS OF DERETH</small><br>
    <small>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    <br>
    I'm excited to announce that I've been recruited by Allen Grey and Caeryn Dryad of
    Crossroads of Dereth to be the new Quest Editor! I've been working closely with them for
    weeks to get the section up and running and today it went live! Go check it out at <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">http://cod.xrgaming.net</a>. You can blame
    them if the updates to my Jackcat site have slacked a bit lately!<br>
    <br>
    The section is designed in layers, so you can get as little or as much spoiler information
    as you wish. I've already received lots of emails congratulating me on my
    &quot;promotion,&quot; with lots of offers to help! Forgive me if I can't get back to all
    of you right away. I truly appreciate all the mail, suggestions and enthusiasm for the
    project. Although I'm just slightly disappointed that no one mentioned what a nice job I
    did on the Yanshi starter quests. ;-) Special thanks to Avar Helgiv of Darktide for
    catching an error on the SoLL quest!<br>
    <br>
    Most of all, I'd like to mention what a pleasure it is to be working with such a
    fabulously talented and fun group of people!<br>
    <br>
    ----------------------------------------------<br>
    NEXUS ARMOR REVISITED<br>
    ----------------------------------------------<br>
    Ok, once and for all: the Nexus Core Gem was one time loot, dropped when the brave
    Derethian heroes felled the Nexus Crystal during the Thorns of the Hopeslayer Event. Only
    one set per server. (Maggie the Jackcat gets mail almost daily asking how to get that cool
    Nexus Armor. The short answer: you can't!)<br>
    <br>
    ----------------------------------------------<br>
    AC SITES IN THE NEWS<br>
    ----------------------------------------------<br>
    Crossroad of Dereth is in the News for their new quest section!!! Ha. (plug, plug, plug.) <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">http://cod.xrgaming.net </a>Silverion at AC
    Tips and Links did his usual efficient job of adding the links almost immediately! But
    again, he left out those great Yanshi quests. I cannot fathom it. See more great links to
    the new quest section here: <a href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/" target="_blank">http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/</a><br>
    <br>
    AC-Caves<br>
    <a href="http://www.ac-caves.ch/" target="_blank">http://www.ac-caves.ch/</a><br>
    This is a great resource if you missed it when I first mentioned it. Thanks to Crick for
    his great collection of Dungeon maps! Turns out that Crick is multi-talented. He's also
    known as Crick the Cook and has been helping me update the food burden stats on my web
    site. <br>
    <br>
    The Rippednbuff Monarchy: Honor, Friendship and Adventure<br>
    <a href="http://www.rippednbuff.com/" target="_blank">http://www.rippednbuff.com/</a><br>
    I've recently started scouring the Allegiance sites because I eventually plan to add
    content to that now vacant section of my web site. There are some really super sites out
    there. The Rippednbuff Monarchy is one of my favorites so far. They've got a really nice
    collection of Lore. Plus they list my Jackcat site under their &quot;Kick-Ass Sites&quot;
    section!<br>
    <br>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS AC SITE NEWS!<br>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    The Runway continues to be one of the most popular features of my web site. I first
    started the section because I knew that if I was curious about what things looked like,
    then others must be too. The chances, after all, of my 20-something sword fighter
    stumbling across a nice 112% Yumi are pretty slim! Once again I'd like to thank all the
    volunteers who have so generously shared their cool loot with the rest of us!<br>
    <br>
    I've also been approached by someone who asked me to help put together a petition for game
    ideas to send to Turbine. I was hesitant, because I think Turbine and the game just ROCK
    (always wanted to use that phrase!) and I certainly don't want to appear critical. I tend
    to think they're very responsive to the players. However, if there's a lot of interest in
    this idea, send me an email and I'll forward it the petition organizer. Some of the items
    on the list are really spiffy. Here's a sample:<br>
    <br>
    15. New char command. /V1, to my #1 vassal<br>
    18. New char command. /FA, to my friends list<br>
    23. Change lock pick to include a chance to disarm &quot;traps&quot;.<br>
    25. Loot body option. If someone attempts to loot your body you receive a <br>
    message asking if you give permission to loot it. If you type yes then they <br>
    can get your stuff for you.<br>
    <br>
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    SCREENSHOTS OF SHADOW ARMOR WANTED<br>
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
    A dynamic gaming environment is a lot of fun! But if you're trying to compile stats, it
    can be a big pain! With the Heroes' Respite update, Shadow Armor got lighter! I'd love
    pics of any and all Shadow Armor stats so I can keep the info up to date. If you have a
    few extra minutes to snap a screen shot or two, I'd appreciate it. Send pics to <a href="mailto:thejackcat@xrgaming.net">thejackcat@xrgaming.net</a><br>
    .jpg format preferred!<br>
    <br>
    See you in the game!<br>
