      <font face="Arial" size="2">After analyzing my stats recently and
      realizing how popular the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Exploration.htm">Exploration
      Society Letters Quests</a> were, in addition to the numerous letters I've
      received lately from newbies, I thought it would be a good idea to put the
      starter quests up in the quest section. Since I've already researched and
      written them, it will just be a matter of tweaking and reformatting them.
      I've started with the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Al-Arqas.htm">Al-Arqas</a>
      and <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Holtburg.htm">Holtburg</a> quests. I hope
      to have the rest up in the next few days.</font></p>

      <font face="Arial" size="2">I've finally added the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hieromancer2.htm">fabulous
      screenshots</a> to the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hieromancer.htm">Hieromancer's Armor</a> quest.
      Thanks to Danier and Doogen for sending them to me! That's not really my
      armor to the right. Danier let me borrow his, just to see what it looks
      like. The crest is gorgeous! There's a nice shot of Danier, Ubaldi and
      Money (Doogen's mule) posing in the three different colors holding the
      Hieromancer's Orb, the Blue Orb and the Globe of Auberean. You'll notice
      that the dark blue coat is missing. Oh well, you can't win them all! ;-)
      Good luck next week, Doogen! We're all rooting for you!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I also sent out a new
      newsletter yesterday. If you've signed up and didn't receive one, <a href="mailto:Maggie@thejackcat.com">drop

      <font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks to Danier for sending in a few
      corrections on the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hieromancer.htm">Hieromancer's Armor</a> quest.
      It's a Diamond Golem which drops the Key for the Dress Trunk in the
      Lyceum, not the Guardian. The Guardian is at the Hieromancer's Hall and
      will cast a nice spell on you at death. It's also now confirmed that the
      Geode drops in both the lower and medium dungeon. Check out the quest page
      for other modifications and additions. I hope to have screenshots up in
      the near future! Thanks to Yu Da-Len and Senshin of MT for additional
      details!</font></p>

      There's lots of goodies to be had, including a Cooking V Dress and Boots

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I told my vassal I wouldn't
      get into a pissing match with a certain clan again, but really, it doesn't
      take&nbsp; a rocket scientist to figure out who's bringing my stats down.
      And as much as I'd like to take credit for the comments that have been
      attributed to me, I really can't. It's not my style to say nasty things
      under the cloak of anonymity. I prefer to do it right here on my Update
      page where I can be assured of the greatest possible audience!</font></p>
