    <p><b>April 27,
      2001 - New Arrows&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
    <p>Maggie...<br>
    <br>
    I am a level 21 archer and just lifestoned out at Fort Tethena. While
    I was there I saw a new arrow I had not heard of before.<br>
    <br>
    They were called SOULRENDERER&nbsp; - did a nice base damage plus they were
    greater arrows. Well I wanted to buy some just to see what kinda of
    damage I could wreck on the creatures of Dereth but they were 67,000
    pyreals for 100. So I didn't get any.<br>
    <br>
    I was just wondering how the arrows are obtained in a more reasonable manor
    -- also I was wondering if you could get a nice write up concerning the
    quest for the barbed fletching tool.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for your help and the great site you have...

    </p>
    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    Let me start off by telling you that your AC Website rocks. You have not
    only created an informative site, but a really FUN site to visit. I
    recommend your site to any newbie I come across, and I also recommend it to
    the veterans who look for in-depth information too! You rule, you rock, you
    kick ass, YOU ARE AWESOME!<br>
    <br>
    Okay! all this ass kissing aside :) I do need your help. What with the
    recent addition of the new arrows (Bloodletter, Fleshripper and Soulrender),
    the Shendolain bow quest becomes more valuable.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, as I was perusing your quest page, I noticed you never mentioned
    how to get the crystal tipped arrows! You have the stats on them, but no
    information on HOW to obtain them. Could you provide some help there? I have
    an archer vassal who's dying to get the Shen bow, so I will need to find a
    big group to do this soon. But any info you can post on the arrows would be
    GREATLY appreciated. Thanks for the great website! WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE!<br>

    are made from Crystal Shards!! You can turn them in to the same brother in

    also now use the three new types of arrows made from Mnemosynes. Hope that
    helps!</font></p>

    <p><b>April 27,
      2001 - </b><b>A Strange Obsidian Shard</b></p>
    <p>Dearest Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I have been long from home, traveling the central desert.&nbsp; As you know,
    these lands are overrun with the strangest dolls. Though they seem
    innocuous, they are anything but...<br>
    <br>
    The other day, I found a strange Obsidian Shard in the packs of one of these
    Innocent Dolls. It appears to be a chunk of polished volcanic rock.
    When I study it, there seems to be movement just under the surface.
    The most eerie thing, however, is that I have felt a strange pressure in the
    back of my mind since I picked up this item.<br>
    <br>
    I took my find to the Obsidian Enchantress, certain that she could help me
    identify the source of this stone. Unfortunately, the evil witch kept
    it for herself, ostensibly for &quot;further study&quot;. I've since
    obtained another of these strange items, but my experiments have been to no
    avail -- I am unable to use it.<br>
    <br>
    I've considered taking this treasure to a trophy hunter, but fear that he
    will not reward me for my efforts. I am beginning to distrust the
    shopkeepers and crafters... could it be that the stone is getting to me?<br>
    <br>
    I write to you for advice and guidance.&nbsp; Have other travelers found
    these strange items or have you heard any rumors from the locals near you?
    My sorrow grows as I search the world for clues, and anxiously await your
    response, hopeful that you have information that will free me from the
    shard's allure.<br>

        I must say that you have a website that is just as addictive as the game

        of me in different states of undress laying around the same area. =P I
        got some help and retrieved all my bodies and was off to the Lugian
        Outpost to work off My Vitae. Once inside I was ok... but then there I
        was again 10 minutes later.... Looked like nap time at a Nursery School.

        not get a Vitae of more than 40%... trust me I know. =P I was killed
        three more times while at 40% and it didn't increase at all. I
        eventually got everything back... just thought I'd share the
