      walkthrough for the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/MinorStones.htm">Minor
      Atlan Stones</a> to the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm">Quest Section</a>.
      Major Stones and Tools coming soon! (famous last words ;)&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>As usual, I am so behind on mail
      that I may never catch up. (Almost 600 unanswered emails, so please
      forgive me if one is yours!) Thanks to everyone who sent such great stuff
      in to me. I'm working hard to plow through it and put everything up on the
      site. I'll do my best to give personal responses, but I'm afraid I may not
      be able to do so for everyone. If you don't get a response personally,
      well, it doesn't mean that I don't love you! ;-)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Have a safe and Happy New Year,
      everyone. See you next year!</small></font></p>

      </strong><small>I'm back! No new update, but somehow, my code got screwy
      when I tried to change the Top 100 button at the bottom of the page.
      Things weren't showing up in Netscape and all kinds of havoc was going on.
      After endless fooling around with it, I've reverted the site back to an earlier version, so if you're still
      having trouble viewing it, let me know.&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I did add a few more locations
      to the <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains.htm">Bargains</a> section and will
      try to get back on track updating as soon as I get back in the groove. I
      hope everyone had a great holiday!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>Dec

      Armor pieces. Russano the Wise and friends of Harvestgain also
      sent another batch of stats and pics. And thanks to Lipskid
      of FF for pics of the Explorer Yumi. I'm not sure how it
      happened, but there were almost no duplicates in the contributions people
