    <p><b><span lang="en-us">April 19</span>, 200<span lang="en-us">2</span> -&nbsp;</b><span lang="en-us"><b>Changes 
    to Item Magic</b></span></p>
    <p>Hi ho again. With the new update, Item Magic's transport functionality 
    has been completely changed. This article will detail what was changed, what 
    the new forms are, why the changes were made and needed, and will have some 
    speculation on what the future holds.<br>
    <br>
    Item Magic used to be the only way to get to a lifestone or portal without 
    the obvious messiness of &quot;/lifestone&quot;, which caused you to be killed and 
    appear at the lifestone normally. This patch has changed the /lifestone 
    command so that it no longer kills and lifestone tosses, it now simply 
    functions as the old lifestone recall used to, which is to say that it 
    tosses the character &gt;alive&lt; to his or her lifestone. This function is 
    available to ANY character, whether they have any magic or not. Thus basic 
    transportation is enhanced greatly for almost any character.<br>
    <br>
    Item Magic was also used to do portal recalls, portal summonings, and to 
    generate hard portal ties. There was always a high level of confusion about 
    portal ties, and there was a lot of &quot;cheese&quot; associated with them as well. 
    Here is how it USED to work, and why it was used in that fashion.<br>
    <br>
    There were &lt;and still are, they're merely less important now&gt; two kinds of 
    portal ties, which are usually simply called &quot;hard ties&quot; and &quot;soft ties&quot;. A 
    Hard tie is a tie generated through the use of a portal tie spell. Once 
    established, a Hard Tie could only be overridden by another Hard Tie. As a 
    practical example, a person could Hard Tie to the top of Arwic Mines, run 
    though a portal at the bottom, and still be tied at the top. This is what 
    most people think of when they think of a &quot;tie&quot; in general.<br>
    <br>
    Soft Ties merely refer to the tie which people who have NEVER learned portal 
    tie have. In the case of people who never learned tie, the last portal 
    traveled through counted as their tie. This had a great deal of 
    non-intuitive effects which were used and abused to lesser and greater 
    extents.<br>
    <br>
    With a soft tie, it was possible to recall to &quot;no tie&quot; dungeons. As an 
    example, a character could &quot;soft tie&quot; to the Acid Vault, and successfully 
    use it to recall into the Acid Vault, provided he or she NEVER went through 
    another portal, with a very few exceptions. Most of the old &quot;no tie&quot; 
    dungeons were therefore better thought of as &quot;no hard tie&quot; dungeons. This 
    was a great boon to people who wished to level quickly, as they could soft 
    tie to a dungeon which others could not reach, and slay the monsters within 
    without having to share quite so much with other characters.<br>
    <br>
    This aspect was well known to both the player community and to Turbine, and 
    neither seemed to have had much of a problem with it. What was less thought 
    about was the fact that someone could soft tie to more inaccessible areas, 
    say the lower part of the Chakron dungeon, and then recall in freely, 
    bypassing the dangerous upper part.<br>
    <br>
    What was more of a problem, was that this same person could soft tie to the 
    lower Chakron dungeon, then recall to their lifestone, and level up via 
    passed up xp, or open adventuring to say level 60, then recall into lower 
    Chakron, bypassing the level restriction, and run the quest, all assuming of 
    course that they never went though another portal, which would have 
    transferred the soft tie to THAT portal. This was made possible because the 
    portal only checked for the proper levels when it was originally transited, 
    not when recalls took place.<br>
    <br>
    This affair of placing higher leveled people into dungeons using soft ties, 
    dungeons where they could not ordinarily be in, and dungeons which were 
    designed for others presented quite a problem to Turbine, and was one of the 
    reasons for this major functionality change.<br>
    <br>
    What was done.<br>
    <br>
    The new Item Functionality has several parts. The first part is the fairly 
    simple expansion in the number of places to which a character might recall. 
    A character may now attune to a lifestone, where they will appear after 
    death, and to which they may recall using /lifestone, AND the same character 
    may hard tie to a lifestone for purposes of recall only. Thus the spells &quot;Lifestone 
    Tie&quot;, and &quot;Lifestone Recall&quot; come into play. Note that this means the old 
    spell of Lifestone Recall has been changed in function<span lang="en-us">;</span> 
    it no longer takes a character to their attuned or death lifestone, but to 
    their tied lifestone.<br>
    <br>
    As part of this expansion, there is now a complete second set of portal 
    affecting spells. Secondary Portal Tie, Secondary Portal Recall, Summon 
    Secondary Portal, Summon Secondary Portal II, and Summon Secondary Portal 
    III. These provide for characters to have two portal ties, for them to 
    summon to two different places, etc., and are really quite straightforward 
    in concept and operation. The key is that the Primary stuff all affects one 
    portal, say Arwic Mines, and the Secondary stuff all affects another portal, 
    which for this example will be the Obsidian Plains BSD. It would be possible 
    for a character to change this around so that the Secondary Tie was to Arwic, 
    and Primary to OPBSD, and so on, the names are really not important.<br>
    <br>
    It is now possible to establish hard ties to portals which previously could 
    only be reached through soft ties. As an example, characters may now TIE to 
    the Major Stone Vaults. They may not summon portals to there, but they would 
    be allowed to recall to them should they wish. This is done normally, by 
    selecting the portal in question, and tying to it.<br>
    <br>
    A character could, should they wish, continue to use their ability to soft 
    tie to a dungeon. It is possible that in some rare cases, this will continue 
    to provide a comparative advantage to learning portal tie. However, in most 
    cases this advantage has been erased, and in the opinion of this author, 
    while there may continue to be grand<span lang="en-us">-</span>fathered 
    characters whose old ties exist, Turbine is making an effort to eliminate 
    this advantage, and will likely continue to do so.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the ability to hard tie to a number of dungeons which previously 
    only accepted soft ties is very handy, and means that for MOST characters, 
    tying to their hunting dungeon is now possible.<br>
    <br>
    Portal Restrictions<br>
    <br>
    Portals used to be thought of as being one of the following:<br>
    <br>
    Open - Portals like Arwic Mines counted as open, they could accept any form 
    of tie, and could be summoned and recalled.<br>
    <br>
    No Tie - Actually a misnomer, these portals would accept soft ties only, and 
    could be recalled to, but could not be summoned. The Acid Vault is an 
    example.<br>
    <br>
    No Tie, No Soft Tie, No Summon, No Recall - An example of these are the town 
    and special archmage portal gems. These did not blur a soft tie, and could 
    not be recalled through, summoned, etc. Note that there are still grand<span lang="en-us">-</span>fathered 
    characters who can recall to the Mayoi mage shoppe.<br>
    <br>
    No Tie, No Soft Tie, No Summon, No Recall, Must have DM - These are portals 
    which a character could go through, but not affect, soft tie, hard tie, 
    recall,<span lang="en-us"> </span>or summon. Virtually all ML portals were 
    and are of this type.<br>
    <br>
    These portal descriptions have changed a great deal.<br>
    What we have now is:<br>
    <br>
    Open - unchanged<br>
    <br>
    No Summon - Many of the old &quot;no tie&quot; dungeons are now of this type. These 
    dungeons may be tied to for purposes of recall only, they may not be 
    summoned. They are still a great deal more accessible to most characters due 
    to the tie ability though. The Acid Vault is now No Summon, not No Tie.<br>
    <br>
    No Tie - These are now truly no tie, no soft tie, etc. In other words, if 
    the character doesn't go through the swirly purple thing, they're not 
    getting to the other side.<br>
    <br>
    No Summon, Must have DM - Mansion portals and Villa portals are of this 
    type. These may be tied to and recalled assuming the account so doing has 
    DM, but they may not be summoned.<br>
    <br>
    Note that the changes mean a character may recall to almost any hunting 
    portal EXCEPT for those on ML.<br>
    <br>
    Overall these changes close a large number of loopholes, and improve the 
    speed with which characters can hunt, by greatly hastening transits to and 
    from the various dungeons. Which the changeover will be a bit confusing and 
    messy, the changes look quite solid.<br>
    <br>
    Have fun guys, hope this helps explain somewhat.<br>

    <br>
    Have enjoyed your site since the beginning. I have not seen this mentioned 
    anywhere, but the April patch nerfed the mage portal gems. Mage gems no 
    longer summon to the mage shops, but now, will only summon to the last 
    summonable portal.<br>

    Hi Nhi Vanye -<br>
    I can only assume this was an effect of the changes to the Item Magic and 
    Portal spells where the spells no longer do what they used to. I would guess 
    they're on the list to be updated by Turbine as well.</font></span></p>

    <br>
    I have been searching for weeks for the Northern Black claw to complete the 
    quest for the orb. I decided to give up for a bit and go on the Gelidite 
    Library quest instead and to my surprise...on the way to the library I ran 
    into no less than 7 Northern Black Claws. If anyone needs help finding them, 
    try this simple route to the library:<br>
    <br>
    Start in Holtberg and travel NW tagging each lifestone as you go....when you 
    reach the life stone at 65.9N 2.6W (It's in the castle located there...the 
    one with the po<span lang="en-us">r</span>tal to Hilltop. Head North West 
    again towards the life stone at 70.4N 17.3W (near the Gelidite Library)<span lang="en-us">.</span> 
    Along that route I spotted 7 different occur<span lang="en-us">r</span>ance<span lang="en-us">s</span>. 
    The first was less than 1 click north from the castle. Good luck to all who 
    search for the orb! and I hope this helps.<br>

    <p>Dear Ms. The Jackcat,<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your wonderful site. Your quest section has enabled me to 
    acquire such nifty things like a ravenous sword, Elysa's ring, and snowmen. 
    Your shopping guide has helped me craft goodies for the hard-working 
    summoners of the Most Holy Hub. In short your site is swell, swell as in 
    great and wide of scope as opposed to swollen and wide of berth. I hope one 
    day I will find something neat that I can e-mail to you in order to help 
    others in their journeys on Dereth.<br>
    <br>
    Gratefully yours,<br>

    to the Newbie Quests</b></span></p>
    <p>From this month's patch note:<br>
    <br>
    <i>The Society Explorer quests have undergone a minor face lift: The agents 
    give you more information about the quests in the outpost towns, all 
    dungeons associated with quests are now restricted up to level 20 (in some 
    cases they had been restricted to level 6), some of the spawn timers on the 
    quest items have been reduced to the proper level (roughly 30 seconds), and 
    the rewards are overall greater for the quests. </i><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I've not seen much information about this<span lang="en-us">,</span> so I 
    went looking myself: <br>
    <br>
    All town now give 5k exp for doing all their quests. The material rewards 
    are all the same (the 2 healing potions,<span lang="en-us"> </span>and ~200p 
    cash they give. But the Exp<span lang="en-us">erience</span> has been raised 
    in many spots. <br>
    <br>
    You might also want to mention these are good quests for gimp trade mules, 
    because nearly all the monsters don't react until attacked. Except for some 
    L4 drudges. A lot easier th<span lang="en-us">a</span>n when my extreme axer 
    had to be seriously afraid of getting stamina drained and killed cause he no 
    longer could evade. <br>
    <br>
    Update to Questing:<br>
    <br>
    Holtb<span lang="en-us">u</span>rg: 1500 exp for each outpost, and 2000exp 
    +200p+2healing for turning brogard axe. Note: Axe's value is now 0. <br>
    <br>
    Rithwic: Giving ring of Mindorla nets you 2500 exp, and giving her letter 
    gives you 2500 exp again. <br>

    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Steven -<br>
    Thanks for the updates! I've been running through the newbie quest myself 
    and have updated a few. I've also been working with Greeneyes of
    <a target="_blank" href="http://acmaps.acsage.com">AC Maps</a> to make sure 
    we have all the updates to the dungeon levels. This will certainly cut down 
    on some work for us! Thanks very much. </font></span></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">I was interested to hear that 
    you seemed to approve of the non-attacking monsters. I was kind of 
    disappointed when I realized they would not attack any more. I remember the 
    very first time I did all these quests, when I was figuring them out from 
    scratch. It was terribly exciting and great fun, and I felt such a sense of 
    accomplishment when I was successful. I was extremely proud when I got my 
    little char through the Shreth Hive, learning to dodge the falling drudges 
    at the beginning and making it to the end. Ah well, I can understand the 
    change even if I didn't personally like it. At least those pesky Shallow 
    Sharks guarding Abmim's Corpse are as nasty as ever. Even using my newly 
    upgraded Miyako's Moonstone didn't stop me from getting killed 2x! Can you 
    believe returning that dagger, probably the hardest task of the bunch, is 
    only a measly 300py? ;-) </span></font></p>

    <p>I'm sure you've already heard, but the buff statues seem to have been replaced shortly before April Fools began and are now casting debuffs. Some servers are reporting certain statues missing, and a couple have TWO statues!<br>

    There's a lot of speculation that Candeth Martine is behind all of this, and that through the Zharalim<span lang="en-us">,</span> he may have manipulated and ultimately corrupted Nuhmirdra. This may be the next step in Martine's plans to destroy the Isparians and lash out against Asheron.<br>

    Important Quest Turn-In Warning</span></b><br>
    <br>
    Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I'm sure you've got this a zillion times, but I thought it important enough to be worth sharing.  People have been bitching and moaning about not receiving their skill point credit from handing in the clay figurine.  It turns out that the problem is most likely that they moved after handing it in, before receiving the reward.<br>
    <br>
    The recommendation from the developers is that on all quests when you hand something over, you should remain inactive, idle, motionless, static, immobile, inert and basically not touch keyboard and mouse until you receive the reward. Particularly for once-in-a-character's-lifetime quests like the Skill Credit Quest.<br>
    <br>
    Incidentally, I really enjoyed reading your posts on the VNBoards on the topic of 'world vs. game' and the effect your site has had.  I'm a regular user of your site, so that I can plan and lead quests.  When I do, I also like to go and actually get the relevant lore, and lead my group through the appropriate discoveries.  For me, and most of the people I play with, it's only partly about getting the Big Dungeon Treasure (or Worthless Quest Trinket), and more about having fun with a group of friends, and your site is ind<span lang="en-us">i</span>spens<span lang="en-us">a</span>ble for selecting the right quest for our levels, and finding stuff to do that's appropriate for our group.  You're not the only site I use, I use other quest-throughs and map sites, but your info is the best!<br>

    <span lang="en-us">I see you caught me star-farming on the Vault! ;-) Thanks 
    very much for sending the warning in. I know I've read it several places by

    player whose friend had the misfortune to miss out on the skill point. They 
    had to learn from an +Admin that he was out of luck. I'm very glad my own 
    quest was a success (thanks again to Julian's Touch and his brother!). Along 
    with the skill refund from last month's event, I can now get Life Magic at 
    55! (I'm level 53 now.) With the way my vassal has been tearing up BSD, and

        <p>I was just looking through the archived stuff on your site Maggie, and am just amazed at how far back it goes.  It was waves and waves of nostalgia as I read from the first months of the great start to this game.  I read that you played in AC beta.  Did you start in the early beta or the public beta?  So while I was reading about the first months of AC<span lang="en-us">,</span> I thought about how nice it'd be if you'd happen to have some archived stuff as early back as beta >_&lt;<br>
        <br>
        <span lang="en-us">T</span>he lag was absolutely horrible back then, but at least it seemed the average player age was over 20 :p *goes to reverie about more civil times*</p>

        <p><font color="#FFFF99">Hi <span lang="en-us">Hoshino Ruri</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">I started AC in Beta 0! I still have my first AC CD! 
        Your letter triggered feelings of nostalgia in me as well and prompted 
        me to go dig back through some of my old files and screenshots. I've 
        been slowing filling in some of the older events on my
        <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm">
        Auberean History</a> page (you may have noticed the
        <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Sudden2.htm">Sudden 
        Season</a> page that I recently completed). I'd been meaning to add the 
        Beta events for a long time and have never gotten around to it. Well, 
        now you can see Maggie the Jackcat fighting a Tremendous Monouga during 
        a <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Arms.htm">Call to 
        Arms</a> (See, I'm just standing way back from it to get a good 
        screenshot. I wasn't scared, nooooo not me! No siree!!), facing
        <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Wardiel.htm">
        Wardiel</a> during his assault on Qalaba'r, and experiencing the 
        bittersweet ending of Beta during
        <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Fire.htm">The Fire 
        in the Sky</a>.</span></font></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">It's certainly fun to 
        reminisce about the good ole days. As to Beta being &quot;more civil times,&quot; 
        I'd have to disagree. Reading through some of the old newsposts and 
        emails from beta days made me laugh and laugh. Mages complaining that 
        the spells don't last long enough, that being a mage is too expensive, 
        that the game is unbalanced. Don't worry, the melees and the archers had 
        their fair share of complaints too! Rants and raves galore. People 
        calling each other bad names. Whining and castigating and bemoaning! 
        Hmmm. I wonder if the world will be more enlightened hundreds of years 
        in the future during AC2. ;-)</font></span></p>

        <p><b><span lang="en-us">April 5, 2002</span> -&nbsp;</b><span lang="en-us"><b>Important 
        Information Needed on Quest Items</b></span></p>
        <p>Maggie,<br>
        <br>
        Your site is the best AC resource available. I use it for 99% of all my 
        inquiries.<br>
        <br>
        BUT....<br>
        <br>
        I've sent this request in previously, but again, I find that the info I 
        most need is not available on most of the quest items on your site. I 
        also realize that it is from the players that you get this info or not 
        get the info as the case may be.<br>
        <br>
        What I would like to see is a small box of info on the bottom of each 
        quest type item of the following:<br>
        <br>
        Give/No-Give:<br>
        Drop/No-Drop:<br>
        Drop on Death/Non-Drop on death.<br>
        <br>
        There are items out there (like shadow armor) that are giveable, 
        dropable, but are no-drop on death. This is extremely important to 
        people who play on Darktide (like myself). Atlan weapons are 
        no-give/no-drop/no-drop on death. The Exquisite Elari Wood Bow is: 
        Giveable/Dropable/ (drop/nodrop on death???). Do I go and try to get 
        this bow if I will most likely drop it when I die?<br>
        <br>
        Spike Lady (WE)<br>
        Misstake (DT)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font color="#FFFF99">Sure thing! Please compile the list and send it 
        to me and I'll be happy to add it! ;-)<br>

        OUCH.<br>
        <br>
        If I knew all the answers, I wouldn't need your site now would I?&nbsp; lol<br>
        <br>
        I am sure I have a few things (see previous email for 2 cases), but 
        there<span lang="en-us"> </span>are<span lang="en-us"> </span>a<span lang="en-us">
        </span>lot that I do not know about.<br>
        <br>
        Singularity weapons are destroy on death until you upgrade, then they<span lang="en-us">
        </span>become no-drop/no-drop on death correct?<br>
        <br>
        I would be happy to supply any info that I have.&nbsp; Even if it is limited.<br>
        <br>
        Also, if you do post the partial info (like the elari wood bow), maybe<span lang="en-us">
        </span>someone else would be able to fill in the blanks for ya.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Since you took my cheeky 
    response so well, I decided to go ahead and start working on this much 
    requested feature. On my new
    <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests2.htm">quest table</a> 
    (page is an incomplete version and may be slow to load) you'll be able to 
    find out the drop status of quest items, level restrictions and timers. I'd 
    love help from everyone filling this is, so all of you who write to me 
    saying you'd love to help out, now's your chance! Do it for Spike Lady! ;-)</span><br>
