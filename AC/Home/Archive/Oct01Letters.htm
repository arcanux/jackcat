    <p><b>October 29, 2001 -&nbsp; I Bought A House!</b>
    </p>
    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    Housing became available a little past 6PM eastern time (GMT-5). It took me 4 hours and dozens of kills, but I finally obtained the crest needed for the housing writ. After turning it in for the writ, I went house hunting as I had an iron golem heart packed away. 300,000 pyreals uses up a huge amount of slots! You will note that the deed has a date/time stamp, so you can see just how lucky I got. I was not Wi flagged for once!<br>
    <br>
    The search was tough. My one "must have" is a westward facing window to watch sunsets from, and I had made a listing of such cottages. I started in Yaraq, went South to Al-Arqas, working my way down my list of candidates. Finally, in a place refered to as "Cragstone Meadows" just south of Cragstone, I found cottages for sale and I bought one. It is a lovely Sho style home. While not my first choice, I am quite delighted over this, and you should see the sunset from my window! I have been playing since closed beta and this moment is the happiest I have ever had in the game! I am actually going to pop a bottle of champagne in RL. Wish you where here! Enjoy the pictures!<br>

    <p><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Tharkun -<br>
    Congratulations! Me too! I scoured acres of forest, but didn't find one
    Missionary. Acres and acres. After a tip from Gyes the Intrepid of SC, I
    headed to the desert. The first Missionary I killed didn't have the Crest. I
    searched and searched and was beginning to get discouraged... when I heard a
    voice inside my head. Then the voice spoke again. And suddenly, I was facing
    another Falatacot Missionary. I got my Crest on the 2nd try! I could hardly
    believe it! I ran to my (old!) home in Zaikhal and traded the crest for a
    Writ. Then I pulled an Iron Golem Heart and some money out of storage and
    raced to the cottage I hoped to buy in the Linvak Mountains. It was for
    sale!! I was able to use 3 M notes (instead of pyreals), my writ, and the
    Iron Heart to purchase my new home.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">The transaction caused the crystal to glow, then
    rise and slowly twirl, marking my ownership. I next ran about 20 yards away
    and typed: @house recall. I was teleported right onto the crystal! So I ran
    50 yards away and did it again! Haha. I love my new house. I placed an old
    Drudge Head in my storage chest, just because I could (besides, it's kind of
    gross to carry around), and went ahead and paid the upkeep for the month, so
    I didn't have to worry about it.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">I spend the remainder of the evening scouting out
    Missionaries for my vassal, Ned Cleversun. When I last left him he was on
    his gajillion and third one. No crest. But I'm sure he'll have success in no
    time!</font></p>

    another!</font></p>

    <p><b>October 26, 2001 -&nbsp; Virindi Grand Inquisitor</b>
    </p>
    <p>I was just casually hunting around the OP when I had the strangest thing show up on radar - a Virindi Grand Inquisitor.  It was surrounded by a normal Virindi Inquisitor and 3 Virindi Executors.  As shown in the pictures attached, it was the same level as a normal Inquisitor (210).  It also had about the same magic defense as one.  However, it had nearly double the health of a normal one, appeared to be reasonably larger, and did level 7 creature debuffs, such as Weakness 7 and Frailty 7.  It also had a much faster healing rate than a normal Inquisitor (which is saying a lot!).  After a few minutes I had it dead and it dropped an Obsidian Shard, a Quick III Necklace, and Bludgeoning Pro III Pants.  The Obsidian Shard translated as the same thing from normal Inquisitors.  Anyway, it seems to me that this is one of the special monsters, like the Diamond Lord, introduced last patch.  Since Inquisitor spawns are not very common, it is no wonder that I had not heard of one of these being found previously.<br>

    <p><b>October 24, 2001 -&nbsp; A Long Tale</b>
    </p>
    <p>Dear Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    Greetings and news from some of the far corners of Dereth.  I wanted to share a single word with you, but first I wanted to ask you to verify something for me please?  It's not urgent - but - if you can afford a messenger back on this one question, you may help me get some sleep this week.  Is it true some crafters have created a mask that makes the owner's head disappear?  Maggie is this true? Please say it's not so -- surely if our crafters have been able to develop this skill... oh surely they've not -- then the Virindi also must have it?  What's to say they haven't *already* created cloaks from the same fabric?  I've lost sleep over this -- well, no, I've woken from my rest with nightmares.  It's a hand... and a sickle, and thin air behind the bony hand holding the sickle. I can fight the monster of my dreams, but I cannot hit it, cannot yield it, cannot run around it... and cannot get away from it.  Maggie - I cannot *see* my attacker.   Ultimately I wake terrified as the sickle falls... then I can say it out loud:<br>
    <br>
    Bore.<br>
    <br>
    Saying the word out loud hurts, yet it's strangely therapeutic.  Maggie, I've been working on a map of it for nine weeks now.  I've raised my magics, I've raised my melee defense, and I've stayed out of the place for weeks to raise my spirits.  And so right about the time I reached the 70th level of advancement, I decided it was time to return to the Bore and try my skills out - and finish the danged map.<br>
    <br>
    Ironically, this all happened on a whim.  I was passing through the hub when someone proclaimed they had a new portal to the Caul.  You know about the level 55 restricted Island, yes?&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    You see, I had been fighting the Caul for several days.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    [Good news: it's thinned a bit.  Bad news: It's still a terrific challenge -- as a non-specialized
    (aka 4-school) mage, none of my magics are that further ahead of the others, but still I'm proud that I can get them all well
    over 320 with my own buffs and that blessed (or is is cursed?) focusing stone.  Needless to say these skill levels are really a minimum for success at the Caul.  Still, after two days of working the Caul's entry area and the surrounding valleys, when I stumbled across someone *casting* a portal to the Caul, I was intrigued.  You may recall it's not a summonable portal.]<br>
    <br>
    Intrigued -- and not really buffed -- I tied to the portal and recalled through it.  Sure enough, I woke up on the Caul!  But I was in a different area -- north of the center of the Isle.  I made several new friends the evenings I fought in this area.  I decided I was doing something right when I was able to yield, vuln and kill several Virindi Inquisitors! Just pleease
    don't ask how many "licks" it takes to yield an inquisitor! This new area is north of the castle-like structure on the Caul - but still land-locked due to the valleys and hills surrounding the recall area. Fortunately, there are also *fewer* hollow minions on the tops of the hills in that area.  Those Tereberous Minions... Maggie, well, they'll probably show up in some other recurring dream.... some other day...  Still, after hunting this area for 2 days, I determined the only way out of that recall area is to jump down off the hilltops.  I tried to organize an exploratory party to no avail.<br>
    <br>
    And so I returned to my ongoing project -- to complete my mapping of the Bore dungeon.  The good news is this: I've seen the place in its entirety.  Maggie there are *four* guardians in the Bore Dungeon, and the pit is a trap.  Please tell your students not to jump into that pit.  It's longer, but also much safer to proceed south from the pit, fight another dozen or so creatures, and approach the lightning pit from the south.  Entry into the pit area offers you two paths out; each of the two paths out of the pit area splits again, thus my count of four "wings" of the dungeon.  Once in a wing, there are no choices along the way, and each wing will lead for about a kilometer to a guardian's lair.  Along the way, expect to encounter very high level Virnidi (fortunately no inquisitors), Rampager Tuskers, very pesky drudges and -- this varies from wing to wing - anywhere from very few to several hollow minions - the tereberous type.  Unfortunately only  70% or so of map is on parchment.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of my work in progress and I'll copy the scroll and send you what I have.  As you'll see if you read ahead, I wont be going back in there for, well, a while at least.  Hmm. where was I? oh yes, trying to map the place.  I called upon my dear friend Calli -- she's becoming quite the archer
    extraordinaire!  We went to Sotiris first -- to see how well we could handle the hollows (recall I'm improving my melee Defense).  Our combined skills were "close enough" -- so I thought.<br>
    <br>
    The Caul was a disaster.  Calli and I managed to get deep within it (okay not *that* far) before we realized several things -- first, someone was slowly fighting ahead of us - making our passage falsely easy -- and second, there are places in the Caul where fighting the nearest minion
    will cause it to call three or four of his "friends" to assist.  Lastly, and most importantly, I learned that even if you're a 4-schooler -- yes, even if you're a mage with melee defense, 4 minions beat you down faster then you can heal. While my melee defense was an asset in Sotiris against the lower and mid-level minions, these upper-level minions were hitting me with great consistency.   I hate to admit it (and you know I
    don't mean this as an insult to my melee friends!) -- but there really are times when there is just no substitute for a strong shield.<br>
    <br>
    And so Calli and I went into recovery mode.  Pshew. that lasted for about an hour.  We are indebted to Ogfist (he's level 105!), who was at the Bore helping with a recovery.  His offer of assistance was truly necessary if we were going to make it back to our corpses safely.  After more vitae, rubbing some vitae off on Ogfist, even more vitae, and ultimately putting out a distress call on the Damonarchy communications system,  Ogfist also invited one of his allegiance associated, Soda Pop Bob, along to play shield-tank and slice up the imperiled minions.  Og and Soda were a mighty combination.  Fortunately Calli and I were able to recover our items.  We did leave a bit of dignity behind, and I certainly had to answer to Danier as to why I had dragged a follower into the bowels of that place alone. Fortunately,
    he didn't have to give me *that* hard a time. Believe me, the lesson was already learned.<br>
    <br>
    And so I've settled on getting a good shield :)<br>
    <br>
    Last night I was running rather lazily from Slaughterhouse to Heiromancers for a cash run.  "Lazy" in this case meant stopping for some of the jucier prey.
    Manglers. Dead.  Diamonds.  I even chuckled to myself.  Wouldn't it be neat if one of these days a run from the Slaughterhouse dropoff to the Halls
    would bring me a trophy? It seems the run to the halls -- as many times as I've done it -- never yields a Key, a mote or any of those neato banner parts I keep hearing about.  Oh well....back from my daydreaming.... boom. Diamond pair dead. Run ahead... More
    Manglers. Dead!  I love these wilderness spawns.  When the Manglers and Maulers are spawning together, you can bet if you kill a group of 3-5, that spot will respawn another 3-4 before the spawn changes to some other beast.   The bandies are easy prey and good experience -- so I checked my buff timers, realized I could hang out a while and still safely make my run to the halls... and I engaged the group.  Just as the first one fell, I heard a thunderous sound.  boom boom boOM BOOM BOOM. pause.<br>
    <br>
    Then my stomach fell.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw the whitish-pink glistening of another diamond golem.  Could it be? Naw. CRASH. A golem pounded me in the back.  (It's still sore...) I was playing pattycake with 3 bandies. I'm not close...oh no. to.. the ... spawn... OH NO. I knew that sound, and the glimmer in my eye told me I was in for a pounding.  Another diamond had spawned 20 feet behind me.  Maggie, I respect these creatures even at my level... even with a full set of level 7 buffs and multi-layered banes.  I can take out groups of 4 diamonds
    if I'm careful. Still, they are quite aggressive... and, well, the deserve respect. My immediate thought was that the diamond had to go -- it was a faster moving target, I was in its space... and if there was one that I could see, no... feel, then there would be others. If you inspect my death count, you'll realize I'm not the type who runs when surrounded. I spun an
    outward arcing-slide cast all so I could yield it, turn and face it all in one motion.  I started to shake.  I had only read about them.  This was no diamond golem.  It was a diamond *Lord.*<br>
    <br>
    Now Maggie, I know I'm supposed to take photos and write maps and share and share alike and all that, but believe me when I say I froze.  My camera was, uhh, not nearby at the time.  Honestly, I was out of film!<br>
    <br>
    And I heard it. The yield - Maggie - it stuck! Ow. So did the overhead whack to my head.  Oh dear. Frost bolts.  (Remember my bandie friends are still visiting).<br>
    <br>
    I think I just stood there for a few seconds.  For the first time in, well, quite a while, I was nervous.  My hands started shaking.  I clinched the Virindi wand in my hand so tightly it nearly slipped from my grasp.  There I was, facing a Diamond Lord.  I blinked.  *whish...* diamond golem henchmen were standing up now that I had messed with their leader... And they were interested in me.  Think think. thiiink.  What would Danier do?  Hmm. no good, I
    don't have his magics or his melee Defense.  What would Doogen have done? Hmm, no good. archers... I love em, but not in these sort of close quarters.  Gulp. love these potions, I wonder if there will be a mint flavorrrr... Oh yeah the diamonds were on top of me. Mag, I just froze.  I think something in the back of my mind told me the bandies were going to leave anytime now.  And, well, they didn't.  And I ran.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately I knew the area -- and where the other spawns would be.  I chuckled realizing THIS was why Lonewolf OG runs the "high" side of the hill to get to the halls. I also cursed realizing that as sure as I might run off and leave the Lord at his spawn location, that
    narrowing in the hills between Slaughterhouse and the halls would have some other mage along within minutes... and they would certainly engage the Lord.  ARGH. too much thinking.   At 36 health, little stamina and next to no mana I was out, the Lord had retreated, and I was alone... and resting.<br>
    <br>
    And I shook.... Then... I got angry. The pink rock had cheap-shotted me in the back. no spell, just walked up, planted himself, and rattled my ribcage.  hehe, he really cleaned my clock.<br>
    <br>
    Dispell gem.  Potions (remind me to tell you how nicely my alchemist is coming along... I took healing this week so I can make trade potions.) gulp. swish.  Checked my buff timer.  Plenty of time. I hope. recalled I was still nervous.  Took a knee for a moment. Stared at the death-item of a virinid wand and snagged my focusing stone from my pack.  Back to war mode and I rearranged my spellbar for golem hunting.  We
    don't need no stinking Umbris... or Bandies, when we have backstabbing golems in the hood!&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The Lord's beanie eyes were trained right on me as I closed in on him.  The moment I cast the bludgeon vuln he started towards me.  Crushing Shame. hit. Crushing...fizzle. Crushing... fizzle. Crushing Shame... he resisted.  And he was in my face.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We stood toe to toe for forty-five seconds.  I would hit him with a crushing shame... he would heal. He would whack me - no, bust me - in the face.  War spell. potion. rejuvenate.  drain drain for health. drain drain for stam. converted. heal. heal. heal. OH NO.<br>
    <br>
    He was back to full health.<br>
    <br>
    And so I did it again. I ran.  Maggie, I've always respected the high golems.  You can kill fifty vapors or diamonds or (struggle) with a dozen plasmas, then the next one you encounter will take your feet right out from under you.  They're amazing creatures.  But this was new... there was something different in this golem's spellpattern... I realized I had to kill him quickly.<br>
    <br>
    So I refueled again.  Re-engaging with a shock wave drew him... as planned. And another hit. and another. Then he stopped.  He stopped his charge and started healing "in place." It was as if he *knew* his health was "within range" of death. Looking back, Maggie, I'm convinced, this golem was -smart.-<br>
    <br>
    Identification revealed Impressive stats.  His mana tank was huge. stam... also impressive - health, well, it was all red :)....  ahh HAH.  MANA TANK.  I started draining his mana.  Sure enough he didn't like it. He'd swing, a health drain would heal me up. mana mana mana drain.<br>
    <br>
    Ultimately it was his own thinking that did him in.  When he failed on a healing spell -- due to low mana I'd like to think, he stopped casting spells.  several shock waves and a heal or so later, it fell at my feet.<br>
    <br>
    Opening the corpse was bittersweet.  Recovering the loot was also a lengthy process -- I've not seen one monster drop so many items.  But alas, the "trophy" on him was a diamond heart.  I knew that inside, he was really just a diamond golem.  Similar stats, vulnerabilities, but he was also royalty -- indeed his training was similar to mine.  He drained, he healed, he retreated when I pulled him from his henchmen, and he took time to heal when I took time to heal or perform maintenance.  I'll be better prepared the next time I encounter one of his kind, but I'll probably not be using a shield :)<br>

    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Arryn The Archer -<br>
    Thank you, first of all! I'm glad you enjoy the site. To answer your
    question, there are several ways to find out where things are. If you're new
    to the game, one of the first things you should learn is the portal routes.
    There are three main portal loops, which give you access to most of the
    major towns. You can get from one portal loop to the next by short runs from
    specific towns. My very favorite map of the portal loops is by Mageman. You
    can currently find it hosted on CoD <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/viewimg.php?atlas/maps/townportals.gif" target="_blank">here</a>.
    I still have the copy I printed out from Mageman's old site dated 4-11-00!
    It's a little crinkly, and completely scribbled on now, but I still use it
    almost every time I play! (As an FYI, a few of Mageman's coordinates are
    outdated. The portal from Arwic to Tou-Tou is at 33.8N, 56.4E and the portal

    is <a href="../../Travel/portals.htm">my own list</a>
    of towns, lifestones and portals. When someone tells me coordinates, I
    simply scan my printed copy to see what town it's near. It's not the most
    sophisticated method, but it works for me!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">There are a few other resources I use if I need
    further information. The first is <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/atlas/search.php" target="_blank">CoD's
    searchable Atlas</a>. I'll tend to use this if I want a quick rundown of the
    places near given coordinates. For specific routes to unfamiliar places,
    I'll break out <a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/ac/ac.asp" target="_blank">AC
    Explorer</a>. With this utility, you can plug in a starting position and an
    ending position and it spits out the shortest route. Use caution. Since
    their primary database can be added to by anyone, it does contain some
    inaccurate information. If you just want the web version of the database,
    you can find it <a href="http://clarkzoo.org/asheronscall/places/" target="_blank">here</a>.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">And last, I've started a page of <a href="../../Travel/shortcuts.htm">Shortcuts</a>
    with directions to places frequently asked for. I've been meaning to put the
    page up for the longest time; your letter has inspired me to finally begin!
    Now if only I could get around to updating my outdated Maps links!! ;-) Hope
    that helps and thanks again!</font></p>

    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Malcor -<br>
    Marriage can strengthen political ties between two groups of people. In the
    context of the game that's called &quot;role-playing.&quot; It's the RP part
    of the MMORPG thingy you sometimes see to describe this genre of computer
    games. ;-)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Marriage in Asheron's Call previously provided
    other benefits. A cool looking red-hatted dude would officiate at the
    ceremony and hand out nifty trinkets to the happy couple. (btw, if anyone
    has screens of the marriage tokens, I'd love to add them to the site. please
    <a href="mailto:jackcat@spacestar.net">email me</a>!) Afterwards, they'd get
    FIREWORKS! But, alas, official ceremonies are now defunct, although players
    still carry on the tradition without the fancy formal trappings.</font></p>

    Thank you, Nick!<br>
    I decided to publish your letter, and the one below because they are nicely
    representative of the sorts of letters I get over and over and over
    (although yours, of course, was extra special! ;-). They allow me to address
    something which needs to be addressed periodically. There are those who love
    the site and its organization, and really enjoy one of the philosophies
    behind its creation -- you're supposed to browse! Who knows what you might
    stumble across.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Then there are those who want anything and everything -- spell formulas,
    trade skills, pumpkin carving, crafted items, event news, even shopping for
    special items! -- under a big fat quest section with a link to it in
    flashing bright letters on the top of every page!!! They DON'T LIKE that the
    spoilers are buried deep in a tiny little subsection of the site. They DON'T
    LIKE the unusual section names. They call them &quot;cutesy&quot;,
    &quot;ambiguous&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, and even
    worse! They DON'T LIKE that the site isn't organized like every other AC
    site on the 'net. They write, &quot;Can't you please put a link to the Quest section on
    your main page??&quot;</font>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">My answer will always be: no. While the quests are one of the more
    popular sections, they *are* just one small section of the overall
    experience that is Maggie the Jackcat's Kick-Ass Fabulous AC Web Site! The group of people who like the way the site is set up far
    outweigh the people who do not. If the letters ratio is anything to go by,
    it's about 100 to 1. (I just made that number up. I actually have no idea,
    but I do know its heavily weighted to one side!)&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    My view is that there are plenty of other places on the
    web where you can get your AC served up in a more familiar manner. There are
    plenty of other sites willing to slap up your hacked portal.dat on the
    newspage 10 minutes after the patch is released. Basically, as long as I get
    letters like yours, and know there's at least someone out there who
    &quot;gets&quot; the site, letters like the one below will have no effect.
    Now... people can stop sending them!! ;-)</font>

    Maggie, this is a fantastic site, full of useful information, if you can ever find it.<br>
    <br>
    Whoever uses this site only finds info by accidentally stumbling across it.<br>
    <br>
    I very often send people here because I know the info is here, then they come back to me saying they can't find it. I then spend 10 minutes going through the site to find the info
    I know is here (somewhere) because I once saw it.<br>

    The search facility does not help much nor do the ambiguous section names.<br>

    Very cool write up</a>, though I was surprised to not see the "pretty please" screenies... that is gonna cost me, isn't it? &lt;g><br>

    Might want to mention two things, one factoid, one tactic.<br>
    <br>
    Factiod: The slopes of the slimy floors don't cause damage. That is why that little room to the left of the first door is so nice.<br>
    <br>
    Tactic: Due to this, you may have noticed me running ahead more than usual. I was, and was making sure all the fighting with the spiders etc. took place on the slopes. Really helps, and makes lagging &lt;which someone is going to do, inevitable really>  a lot more survivable.<br>

    First of all, congratulations on Level 90!&nbsp;Secondly, thanks for the

    however, it does bear repeating and deserves more emphasis! I'll probably do
    a little bit of buffing to certain parts of the write-up.</font>

    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Last, I very strongly considered posting the
    screenshot of you standing behind that locked door, BEGGING for someone to
    come open it, while the floor ate away at us and the Grievvers started
    circling. Begging on your knees. Pleading and cajoling and crying! (hmmm, or
    was that me?) But... I felt guilty, since I knew that it was my fault we
    didn't make it through the door in time. I got completely disoriented on my
    way back from the button. I didn't deserve to be rescued. (although I'm glad
    you did!) I also gave it some thought and decided that it simply wasn't
    seemly to publicly mock a powerful Level 90 Monarch with over 1,000

    <p>Hi Maggie.  Love the site.  Always have.  You offer things, ---often strange, seemingly
    useless things, ;) ---that NO ONE else offers to round out everyone's AC experience.  Keep up the great work! I sent a Paypal
    donation, I think.  Something screwed up.  So either you got a donation ($50), no
    donation or two donations ($100).  I hope it was just one.  I'm supportive, but not loaded. :) Take care.<br>

    Wowie zowie! Thank you very much. You know, I highly suspected I would enjoy
    getting gifts of real live cash money from people, and I was right! I did
    enjoy it. A lot. It was so fun checking my
    email today! I certainly wasn't expecting $50.00 contributions; I wasn't
    expecting any contribution, but it was gratifying to get such a generous
    gift on the very first day. (It came through once.) </font>

    Paypal. The Amazon system appears to not allow these little personalized
    notes, although they do have an option which allows the sender to let you
    know who is making a donation. Unfortunately, for the anonymous donations I don't even know who to thank! I'll just take this
    opportunity now to thank everyone who sent a gift through Maggie the
