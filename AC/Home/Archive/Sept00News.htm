      wasn't bad enough that they threatened to try to have my site shut down
      for alleged defamation of character, plus requested that other sites
      remove links to me (for promoting a &quot;hate site&quot;), now they have
      gotten really nasty: they've insulted my looks! *sniff* *sniff*</small></font></p>
