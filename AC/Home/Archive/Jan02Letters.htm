    Re-Entry Into Dereth</span></b></p>
    <p> Dear Maggie, <br>
    I just wanted to thank you for the information on your website. I was an 
    avid AC player for about a year and then six months ago <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    decided to give another online game a try<span lang="en-us"> </span>(WWII 
    online)<span lang="en-us">.</span> <span lang="en-us">Boy,</span> what a 
    mistake that was! I decided that <span lang="en-us">I</span> would come back 
    to AC and just renewed my subscription yesterday evening<span lang="en-us"> 
    [letter was sent in December]</span>.
    </p>
    <p> After about a 5 hour download that took all of last night<span lang="en-us">,</span>
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> was ready to pick up where <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    had left off<span lang="en-us"> </span>(or so <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    thought). I logged into Morningthaw with my main character (Aragorn of 
    Arathorn)<span lang="en-us"> </span>who surprisingly<span lang="en-us">,</span> 
    along with my other three<span lang="en-us">,</span> were right where
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> left them. The only problem was that
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> ha<span lang="en-us">d</span> been absent from 
    the game for so long <span lang="en-us">I</span> didn't know where it was 
    that my &quot;guys&quot; were standing... lol<span lang="en-us">.</span> I was 
    absolutely lost<span lang="en-us">. H</span>ere <span lang="en-us">I</span> 
    was, a level 36 sword fighter<span lang="en-us">,</span> completely helpless 
    like a brand new beginner (<span lang="en-us">I</span> suppose in a way
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> am)<span lang="en-us">.</span> My mules were in 
    the middle of wooded areas<span lang="en-us">, I</span> had no idea which 
    town they were outside of<span lang="en-us">,</span> or even which direction 
    the town was.
    </p>
    <p> I saw a passerby<span lang="en-us"> </span>(Teri) and stopped her<span lang="en-us">. 
    S</span>he was nice enough to tell me that <span lang="en-us">I</span> was 
    outside of <span lang="en-us">E</span>astham and while chatting
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> hit a key that made me sit and
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> <span lang="en-us">didn't</span> even know how 
    to get him to stand back up...lol<span lang="en-us">.</span> <span lang="en-us">
    Anyway,</span> she told me 
    about your site and after checking it out <span lang="en-us">I</span> wanted 
    to just say thanks. Your information <span lang="en-us">has </span>helped 
    make my re-entry into the world of <span lang="en-us">D</span>ereth a lot 
    easier....<span lang="en-us"> </span>I am at your service if ever you need

    <span lang="en-us">Welcome back! I'm glad you found the site helpful for 
    your re-entry. It's amazing how game reflexes can atrophy. I had a <i>sort 
    of</i> similar experience over the holidays. I loaded up AC on my laptop to 
    take while I was out of town. Except the laptop, of course, didn't really 
    have a keypad or my little Delete-End-PageDown set of keys. When I logged in 
    to the game, I couldn't figure out how to target, or attack, or change my 
    views or anything! So I died. Repeatedly! Ha. I never even thought to, uh, 
    use the mouse (or touchpad) to target and attack, because I was so used to 
    my keyboard commands. I did adjust, but it reminded me of being a newbie all 
    over again, learning how to do the most simple in-game functions.</span></font></p>

    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    I noticed that 
    <a href="Nov01Letters.htm">Dan'g of Leafcull mentioned</a> that he noticed his
    <span lang="en-us">I</span>tem <span lang="en-us">M</span>agic dropped to zero with the collars on. I think this is because of a spell 
    that was cast on him by the <span lang="en-us">T</span>umerok who controls those 
    <span lang="en-us">r</span>eedsharks<span lang="en-us">: </span>Item 
    Befoulment<span lang="en-us">.</span> <span lang="en-us">I</span>t was almost a killer for me. Buffs ran out and I was debuffed and with no melee defense, those reedsharks can be a killer! Thank 
    Asheron for @house recall, eh? But as to the collars doing that, I think he 
    may be incorrect. I wear one of the collars all the time, with no penalty to 
    my item enchantment skill.</p>

    <p><span lang="en-us">Hi Maggie,<br>
    I was wandering on the northern shore of ML when I ran into Hea Tuperea and 
    his brood of reedsharks. Didn't think too much of his chances until he hit 
    me with a new spell ---- Item Befoulment ----. Darn thing set my item skill 
    to ZERO. So, guess what, no LS or Portal recall! Lucky my feet didn't fail 
    me on this one. Just wanted you to know about this one spell. Boy, what I'd 
    give to have that spell on my mage and then go PK!!!! w00t!<br>

    First off, you have a great site. No doubt about it. <span lang="en-us">It's</span> jam-packed 
    with helpful information and <span lang="en-us">it's </span>a<span lang="en-us">

    <br>
    I was surprised to read that, as a l<span lang="en-us">e</span>v<span lang="en-us">e</span>l 50 player, your vassal had 
    surpassed you. I too have had vassals who re<span lang="en-us">-</span>rolled when they swore to me and 
    <span lang="en-us">then </span>zipped right by me. I suppose it<span lang="en-us">'</span>s hard for some people to understand how 
    much AC can provide enjoyment, not only in the leveling, but in the meeting 
    people and helping others. Be the<span lang="en-us">y</span> new or old,
    <span lang="en-us">I</span> find myse<span lang="en-us">l</span>f spending more 
    and more time running around talking to allegiance members and helping 
    vassals than <span lang="en-us">I</span> do hunting.<br>

    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Hi <span lang="en-us">rv</span> -<br>
    <span lang="en-us">I must admit that I'm not much of a socializer in-game. I 
    tend to do a lot of exploring, and I like to research for the site and to 
    hunt solo. Finding a little pack of Ferals and having them all to myself is 
    my latest favorite obsession. (My friend Danier calls me a &quot;wb&quot;, otherwise 
    known as &quot;waddle-butt&quot;, meaning that I am always overburdened because I am 
    afflicted with the loot bug. I cannot kill a creature *ever* without 
    checking its corpse for fun surprises! I LOVE to loot my kills. Drives Ned 
    Cleversun crazy! ;-). </span></font>

    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">But then again, I also love 
    going on well-run quests with a group of friends or having my vassal douse 
    me with VIIs and take me out for some phat xp. That's the beauty of AC. 
    There's something to suit any number of play styles. Ned Cleversun likes 
    hanging out in BSD Ayan, boosting his grief skill. ;-)</span></font></p>

    <p>Dear Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    I'd like to say that I know of a few people who are real jerks in game, one 
    of them is my friend (he just always acts like that) but I should say, don't 
    let rude people discourage you from having fun<span lang="en-us">. S</span>ome people don't have a 
    sense of humor nor etiquette, and these tac<span lang="en-us">t</span>less people can't take a hint. 
    But that doesn't mean that we should all stop playing because of a few 
    people who are insensitive. Take it from me and the rest of my Clan on 
    Leafcull, we have been called many things, and been told many things too. 
    But we always keep our focus on our goal, that is keeping honor, and fun at 
    max level<span lang="en-us">.</span> <span lang="en-us">W</span>e wish you only the best. Keep up the great work on your page.<br>

    <span lang="en-us">I know this letter is a little dated and refers to an old 
    complaint I made about someone being rude to me in-game (a *very* rare 
    occurrence). But, I tell you, the part about your friend just made me laugh 
    and laugh!! That aside, I heartily agree with the sentiments. Maximum fun 
    should always be a goal. :)</span></font></p>

        The run was somewhat hazardous but manageable with good buffs and a pair 
        of fast legs. There's tiny swamp plot next to Waijhou, which essentially 
        is a big house with a few vendors, and it has baddies all around. 
        There's another two plots of swamp land very close to waijhou, simply 
        follow the water... There are dark raveners, olthoi nobles, slavus, 
        etc... I came upon a small camp of mosswart mire witches, where there 
        were 6 of them. The last one, yes the last one, gave me a cloak. yay!&quot;</font></span></p>

        Cottages</span></b></p>
        <p><span lang="en-us">Ma</span>ggie,<br>
        For the past 5 days <span lang="en-us">I</span>'ve been camping a house...umm a cottage<span lang="en-us">.</span> So
        <span lang="en-us">I</span> got 
        to thinking, and wondering and doing stuff. I've found out quite a few 
        things to do when you<span lang="en-us">'</span>r<span lang="en-us">e</span> bored.<br>
        <br>
        Use one of the new commands, like *play dead* or *sit back*.<br>
        Use the c key plus the left or right arrow when in position.<br>
        Do a full jump while still holding the keys.<br>
        Wait till you retain the position to let go of the keys, You'll start 
        spinning without help from your keyboard!<br>
        <br>
        Here's another thing to do...<br>
        <br>
        Get an essence flicker.<br>
        Stare.<br>
        Twich.<br>
        Quiver.<br>
        <br>
        I must also let you know that camping houses is a bunch of crap, but 
        once <span lang="en-us">I</span> get one, it'll be my pride and joy! =)<br>
        <br>
        Also<span lang="en-us">,</span> <span lang="en-us">I</span>'ve established some great relationships with those camping the 
        houses with me....well except for the sque<span lang="en-us">l</span>ched part.<br>
        <br>
        Another fun thing to do is to draw a <span lang="en-us">L</span>ugian or some other creature to 
        the house you<span lang="en-us">'</span>r<span lang="en-us">e</span> camping with a bunch of other people.<br>
        Open the door and trap him inside.<br>
        Buff outside and go kill him and watch the masses come!<br>
        One time we did this with a <span lang="en-us">L</span>ithos
        <span lang="en-us">L</span>ugian and about 933,349,349,381 
        other <span lang="en-us">L</span>ugians came to the house. I was afraid they were gonna squish it!<br>
        <br>
        Jump, jump, jump....<br>
        <br>
        Or just plain have fun with white bunny slippers!<span lang="en-us">
        </span>(<span lang="en-us">I</span>f you can get some 
        on WE that is, heh<span lang="en-us">.</span>)<br>

        <p><b><span lang="en-us">January 22</span>, 200<span lang="en-us">2</span> -<span lang="en-us"> Just Another Thank You 
        Letter</span></b></p>
        <p> I don't even remember how I first came to visit your Fabulous AC 
        Guide - all I can recall is that I'd been playing about three months, 
        was having rotten experiences meeting the &quot;wrong&quot; sort of people (for 
        me, at least) in-game, and had become a reclusive loner of a player as a 
        result. The trouble was, I really did enjoy the game, but wasn't getting 
        &quot;the scoop&quot; on any of the game's finer (actually, essential) points such 
        as Atlans, Composite Bows, Shadow Armor and the like. And at the time, 
        it was getting so frustrating not knowing how to progress in-game that I 
        was getting ready to quit AC entirely.<br>
        <br>
        Then I found your site, and the floodgates of minutae were opened. This 
        was around the time that Gold Letters and Explorer items were introduced 
        to the game, and I've gotta say, your guide to the town stamps, agents, 
        and rewards saved me countless hours - hell, days - of hunting around in 
        ignorance, thinking I'd found the key to something good, only to wind up 
        with an item <span lang="en-us">t</span>hat was completely useless to me.<br>
        <br>
        Since then, for more than a year now, I've found myself frequenting your 
        sit<span lang="en-us">e</span> on an almost daily basis. And thanks to your help - and the many, 
        many people who've contributed details to you - I'm finally at that 
        mid-range level where I can actually be a help to a few other lost souls 
        out there. I didn't even realize I'd &quot;gotten there&quot; until housing was 
        introduced, and in my travels, I'd found things that didn't appear on 
        your page until weeks later. That's when it sort of dawned on me that 
        maybe I should be contributing a few things too, and in some way add 
        back to the pot from which I'd taken so much information myself. Not 
        that I'm any great player, nor even a &quot;bright&quot; one - but the next time I 
        come across something (such as housing locales) that I haven't yet seen 
        on your wonderfully expansive page, I'll be sending you what I've found. 
        Not that I'll be the only one to send pix and coords of some remote 
        detail, but there's always the slimmest of chances that I just might, 
        one day, send you something a day earlier than someone else.<br>
        <br>
        I wish I were high-enough level (and a competent-enough player) to send 
        you info on high-end material like the Elari Bow or where to take dust 
        from Diamond Golems, but I'm not...not yet. And in all of this rambling, 
        the on<span lang="en-us">e</span> thing I really wanted to say was a heartfelt thank-you to you 
        for doing what you do with your web-page. I truly owe you the last year 
        of my game-play, because there's no way I'd have continued on this long 
        struggling for info the way I was back then. Don't you pay any attention 
        to those detractors you sometimes hear from, saying you &quot;lied&quot; blah blah 
        blah - your site has helped more than enough lost souls find what they'd 
        sought but could not find alone. And just as it took me a year or more 
        to get off my tush and write a thanks to you, you can be assured there 
        are hundreds more out there who give a silent thanks to you each and 
        every time they open your page.<br>
        <br>
        And in the holiday season, may whichever Gods you bow to grant you 
        bounty such as you have shared with your fellow man. If there's one 
        thing the Christians got right in the last two millennia, it's that 
        little saying (which I'm about to butcher in paraphrase...sorry!), 
        &quot;Whatsoever you do unto these, God's littlest creatures, you do unto 
        God.&quot; (there - can I go to heaven now?? LoL!). In the end, I just wish 
        you yourself come to benefit as much fr<span lang="en-us">o</span>m the kindness of others as many 
        have <span lang="en-us">benefited</span> from yours.<br>
        <br>
        Be well, within as without,<br>
        Teri (of Morningthaw)<br>
    <br>
        <font color="#FFFF99"><br>
        Hi <span lang="en-us">Teri</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">Your letter is certainly one of the most eloquent 
        thank yous I've received. Is it weird to say thank you for a thank you? 
        :)&nbsp; I receive, on almost a daily basis, thank you notes from 
        players in the game (and, also, thank yous in the form of cash tips). I 
        wish I had more time to personally answer all of them, but I just don't. 
        I try to take what opportunities I can, like this one, to publicly 
        mention my gratitude for all the well wishes, contributions, and kind 
        thoughts and words from people. I love the letters I get. It's one of 
        the reasons I've continued to do the site so consistently. (After all, 
        if you've got something in your life that enables you to receive a 
        steady stream of compliments and suck-ups, who wouldn't continue?! ;-)</span></font></p>
        <p> <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">As I've mentioned before, I 
        get hundreds and hundreds of letters each month. When I'm browsing back 
        through them, picking out ones to publish, I rarely pay much attention 
        to who actually wrote it until I'm editing that particular letter on the 
        page. As I re-read your letter, and came to the end, I was struck by 
        something remarkable. Your letter was signed, &quot;Teri (of Morningthaw).&quot; 
        And where had I just heard that name, but from Aragorn of Arathorn, who 
        was dazed and confused in Eastham one day and chanced upon a stranger, 
        who treated him kindly. A stranger named Teri. </font></span>

        <p><b><span lang="en-us">January 22</span>, 200<span lang="en-us">2</span> -&nbsp;<span lang="en-us">Thank You From Overseas</span></b></p>
        <p>I just wanted to send you a sincere thanks to you for something you 
        might not be aware of.<br>
        <br>
        I'm currently deployed overseas in support of multiple operations for 
        the military. Access to the internet is somewhat limited, and there is 
        no hope that I'll be able to play Asheron's Call during my time away. 
        What's the next best thing? Reading your updates and all of the quests 
        that you have posted on your site. I can get my pseudo-ac fix by 
        planning what quests I will do when I return, and read about the updates 
        that I will miss for the next several months.<br>
        <br>
        I'm not sure if you ever would have thought that you'd be doing your 
        part to support those individuals that are in the US military, but 
        through your site, you are. I offer you my sincerest thanks, and look 
        forward to your <span lang="en-us">next </span>update!!<br>

        <span lang="en-us">Thanks very much. I'm glad to be doing my part. 
        Anything to support the troops! ;-) Thank you to all of you who have 
        sent letters from overseas. We'll see you in Dereth when you return! 
        Safe travels.</span></font></p>

    <p>please help dire the dim and veranda find a loveshack cottage?</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Hi dire the dim and veranda -<br>
    I can't even begin to tell you how many letters and tells I've received from 
    people asking for help to find a house. I appreciate all the suggestions 
    from folks who would like me to please indicate which houses on my list are 
    still for sale, when they will be coming on the market, and which ones are 
    already sold. It's a fabulous suggestion. And I'd *love* to implement it, 
    but... well... it's impossible! Sorry to say, but I do not have any magic 
    way of finding out the information any better than you do. I get mine the 
    old fashioned way -- using my feet. Even if I stumbled across an unsold home 
    on TD, I'd have no way of knowing the status on any of the other servers. 
    The best I can do is continue to update the list with new coordinates as I 
    receive them or discover them. </span>
    </font>
    </p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">However, there is hope! I can 
    point you to three other sources to keep an eye on. Check Crossroads of 
    Dereth's housing information, and more importantly, recently added locations 
    in the Atlas. These are most likely to be the newer additions. AC Vault's 
    housing registry is another good resource. Last, check for recent additions 
    in AC Spedia. </font></span>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Good luck in your home search. 
    It's certainly nice to have a place to call home.</font></span></p>
