      </small>
      </strong><small>Did I mention that I am *obsessed* with the election?!!!
      ;-)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      But I have managed another update! The <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains/Rates.htm">Vendor
      Rates</a> page is finally under construction in the Bargains section. I've
      added the rates of all the towns that have been verified so far, including
      the new island settlements of Kryst and MacNiall's Freehold. Special
      thanks to Maddy and Aunyay for assistance. I'll be adding the info on
      several more towns to the <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains.htm">Bargains</a>
      pages soon.</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I also updated the <a href="../../Travel/portals.htm">Towns
      and Portals</a> page with Kryst, MacNiall's Freehold, Neydisa Castle and
      several other misc. locations. I corrected a few wrong portal locations as
      well! Although Alissa Moon-Ray of Harvestgain insists it's
      not my fault that the coordinates I had listed were wrong, I still feel
      guilty that they didn't lead to actual portals, but deathtraps
      instead!&nbsp; Drat my sloppy tpying skill! Thanks for pointing out the
      errors! :)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm">Letters
      Section</a> updated with info on the new Spine Axes and a trick emote.
      Plus a few more that just say nice things about me and the site. I am so
      self-indulgent! ;-)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>November
      26, 2000<br>
      </small>
      </strong><small>I've been busy having fun, dying on the Vesayen Isles. For
      a while there, with all those cool sound effects and eerie noises, I
      thought I had somehow wandered onto the set of Survivor! Special thanks to
      Adamant and Ellencil for helping me recover my corpse and my pretty purple
      armor!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>New Quest!<br>
      Thanks also to my wonderful vassal Ned Cleversun for helping me with the
      research for the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Rumuba.htm">Rumuba's Jade
      Spear</a> quest! I'd also like to say thanks to famous
      writer Nandesu Ka, and her companions Dalliance and Obunga for sending
      pics and info to get me started.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>November
      25, 2000<br>
      </small>
      </strong><small>Yes, it's true. I've been pretty lax updating the site
      this month! But things are still happening in Dereth; Ned Cleversun's
      death stat has increased by 74 to 758!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>I've added several more towns
      merchant info to the <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains.htm">Bargains</a>
      section: Al-Jalima, Arwic, Ktayyaban, Hebian-To, Mayoi, Lin, Qalaba'r
      &amp; Tou-Tou.<br>
      <br>
      More coming soon! ;-)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>November
      20, 2000<br>
      </small>
      </strong><small>My vassal has informed me that I need to stop arguing
      politics and get to work updating my site. And he wants to see my ass on
      the islands pronto! Hahaha. To sweeten the deal, he's raised his loyalty
      yet another point to 143! I dread to ask what the new death total is. ;)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Yes, while I've been distracted,
      all hell's broken loose! No, I don't mean in FL, I mean Bael'Zharon! I'll try
      and have more patch info up soon. In the meantime, head on over to <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">CoD</a>
      and check out the <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.com/lore/events/SF_BZ.shtml" target="_blank">amazing
      events</a> happening in Dereth. Thanks to Veritus Venatus for the fab
      updating!!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Site Updates:<br>
      New quest! No, it's not one of the spiffy new patch quests, but one from a
      few months ago: <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/MKLJitte.htm">Mi Krau-Li's
      Improved Jitte</a>. Thanks to Vilegoroth for all the help in the
      Labyrinth.<br>
      <br>
      Broken Virindi Mask added to the <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Masks.htm">Masks</a>
      page, courtesy of Anaboo.<br>
      <br>
      Lesser Celdon stats added to the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow
      Armor</a> page. Thanks to Listos!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>And finally, <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a>
      updated. Find out why I think ACSage is one of the best sites in the AC
      Community!&nbsp; And if you're pissed at me for my politics, come take
      pleasure in the nasty things
      being said about me on the 'net! Let me warn you, though,
      it's not for the delicate! ;-)&nbsp; </small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>(I also noticed that I must have
      somehow deleted the link to <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Catri.htm">Catri's</a>
      page on the Nov. 14th update. I've added it back, in case anyone missed
      her the first time!)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>November
      15, 2000<br>
      </small>
      </strong><small>New Patch! Yay!! While I'm personally disappointed that
      there's no new fez, the rest of the elaborate goodies more than makes up
      for it! Archers get some love, new quest, scads of new creatures, plus an
      amazing series of 13 islands off the SE coast of Mayoi. From what I've
      seen so far, I think this just might be the BEST PATCH EVER!!!! Go
      Turbine! :)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>As always, I've started a patch
      page with some initial reports of some of the goodies in the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Stars2.htm">Should
      the Stars Fall</a> event. <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Ulgrim.htm">Ulgrim</a>
      and <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Rumors.htm">Town Criers</a> Rumors have
      also been updated.</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>November
      14, 2000<br>
      </small>
      </strong><small>I did mention I'm a political junkie, didn't I? ;-) I have
      to admit, I've been too absorbed in politics to spend a lot of time
      updating the site! But there's new excitement hitting the scene -- a new
      patch! Yay! Because I know the site always gets a ton of traffic while the
      servers are down, I wanted to get some new content up.<br>
      <br>
      Come visit <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Catri.htm">Catri </a>and her well
      dressed mules up on the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a>.
      Leather has never looked so good!</small></font></p>

      I'll update the .gif as soon as he gets his last two stones! ;-)</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Other additions include the last

      updated with the stats of the Silver Tusker, thanks to Hired sellout. I
      also added the Baby Desert Rabbits that are found in Xarabydun.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Xarabydun also added to the <a href="../../Travel/portals.htm">Towns
      and Portals</a> page. I made a few other minor corrections on that page as
      well.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I've had so many requests for
      info on where to get what, that I finally got around to working on a
      section I had planned to finish long ago: the <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains.htm">Bargains</a>
      section. There's not much there yet, but I'll be adding to it regularly.
      If anyone wants to volunteer to take on a town or two, I wouldn't turn
      down the help! ;-)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>November
      3, 2000<br>
      </strong><a href="../../Pets/beasties.htm">Beaties</a> updated with the stats
      for the Unstable Magma Golem and Mite Warrior Princess. In addition, I
      added the stats of the creatures from the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Gleaming2.htm">Twilight's
      Gleaming</a> patch (Ursiuns, Niffils, and Grievvers) and the new
      Scarecrows and Hollow Minions. I'm still missing various stats of some
      creatures. Check out the <a href="../Stuff.htm">Stuff I'd Like</a> page if
      you ever run across them!</small></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>The <a href="../../Food/cooking.htm">Cooking</a>
      Section was also updated with the new Pumpkin <a href="../../Food/recipes.htm">Recipes</a>.
      I added the Pumpkin to the <a href="../../Food/pantry.htm">Pantry</a> page,
      and the various pumpkin mixtures to the <a href="../../Food/food2.htm">Food</a>
      page. Green Tea icon&nbsp; and <a href="../../Food/special.htm">Specialty

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Broken links in the Cooking
