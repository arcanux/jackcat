    <b>May 22, 2001 - Correction &amp; A Warning On Lugian Armor Quest&nbsp;</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Maggie,<br>
    <br>
    After spend ALL weekend working on the Staff of the Mind quest for my patron, I found a few things in the
    <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Stone2.htm"> Reign of Stone</a> write up that are off a bit. The Lugain Sceptre is not 900 burden, but 4800 burden. It is a very heavy whacking stick.<br>
    <br>
    And now for my warning:<br>
    <br>
    Like I said I spent most of the weekend working on getting the Scepter of the Mind off the LT in the second Lugian camp. I think they call it a camp for a reason, cause there are tons of people there. I was there for a good bit on Saturday and finally the LT spawns and I get the kill, pissed a bunch off, but I did get it. I am a
    Level 50 Archer, but I do have Spear trained. My patron is a 3 School Mage, with War,
    Mana Conversion, and Arcane Specialized. I thought to myself, what a perfect
    gift!
    <p> I then proceed to the dungeon on my way to the Master smith for the
    exchange and then on to Rithwic for the Infusion potion. I am pretty pumped at this point, cause my patron knows nothing about this. I pour the potion on the Staff and I get the message, YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE STAFF......AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
 Why was it destroyed, is the skill check an actual number skill check? Does my Spear have to be really
    high? I have 211 base Spear because it is my secondary attack. From what I have read, the quest requires you to be trained in
    Spear  when in fact you must have pretty high Spear to do it.</p>
    <p>At this point I tell my patron what happens and off we head back to the camp to try again. Once again we wait a good amount of time with no spawn as the sequence has not fully taken place at the other camps. I get tired of waiting now and decide to log of and eat, and later 11:00 central time Sunday My RL wife and I log in back at the camp and within 15 minutes the
    LT spawn right next to me and I lay in, blasting him for 90 on the first arrow, 50 on the
    next. He didn't last long. I ID'd the corpse to see that in fact I got the kill. Once again I am pumped. I open the corpse and reach for the
    Scepter only to find out that it has a %^$#& timer on it. I thought I would pass this along to you so it does not happen to someone else. I have no clue what the timer is on the quest.&nbsp;</p>
    <p> All I can say is that I am very disappointed. If I knew I needed high
    Spear I would have buffed first before trying. I also want to state that I really think it is dumb to have a timer on a quest if you failed it. I can see if
    I got it right the first try and I could not do again. I understand that,
    because, otherwise, people would make a ton of them and trade them all day long. That was not the
    case; I failed and had to wait. That would be like having to wait to String a comp bow when you snapped the first string. It just doesn't seem right.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks for listening to my whining,<br>

    <font size="2">Thanks for all the info. I appreciate it. I haven't finished
    the actual quest write-up yet because I still don't have all the information.
    (obviously!) I've heard that some of the timers are only 24 hours. I hope
    that's the case for you as well. Good luck and let me know how it turns out!</font></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">- Maggie the Jackcat</font></p>
    <p><br>
    Well it seem it was 24 hours, and I got my second Scepter, and buffed to 287
    Spear, and made the Staff of Clarity. Now I am happy, and so is my patron. I
    had a friend trying to make one also who failed at 285 Spear... OUCH. I have
    since made another for another friend and think I will stock pile them
    before they are nerfed like the matty robes and GSA. There is no way they
    will keep something that mean around for long.</p>

    <p>Hi Maggie,&nbsp;<br>
    Just wanted to see if you'd heard anything about changes to the<br>
    explorer society quests. I'm goofing around with a new char and decided to<br>
    get some society goodies on a whim... imagine my surprise when I turned in<br>
    that Yaraq Stamped Letter at Yanshi when I not only got a wand but a token<br>
    to bring to Rithwic... here's the text:<br>
    <br>
    <i>Dai Ya the Scholar tells you, &quot;We could use more explorers such as<br>
    yourself here in the Society. Perhaps you could aid Bach Lien, a
    friend of<br>
    mine? A few days ago, she wrote that she is investigating rumors of a war<br>
    spear guarded by Tumeroks in the area near Dryreach. Fantastical story, I<br>
    sure! But nonetheless, I daresay she could use the help. She's
    stationed in<br>
    the Explorer Society Outpost on the road from Rithwic to Dryreach. Show her
    this token and she will know I sent you.&quot;</i><br>

    Have you heard anything about this? I haven't had an opportunity to check<br>
    it out yet, but I'll let you know when I know more.</p>

    <p>Iron Savant sent in a question about a &quot;taxi service&quot; at your
    local meeting hall. You told him there was no such thing.<br>
    <br>
    Well, we have some very talented people here on Morningthaw.&nbsp; A
    character by the name of Morgus has created a &quot;portal mule&quot; which
    he has posted at the Baishi meeting hall. All you have to do to get
    him to summon the subway is to say the word &quot;taxi&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    He also has some people he doesn't like in-game squelched so that the subway
    will not be summoned for them. Believe me these people<br>
    don't deserve help either. The name of his portal mule is &quot;Blink
    Mule&quot;. I think that would be a GREAT item to feature on your

    On Morningthaw there is a town meeting hall that will open up a Subway

    <p>A general warning: the 'Dull Dagger' is a cursed, no-drop item. If you
    pick one up you're stuck with 450 burden of useless junk. I <i>think </i>you'd
    then need an Archmage or perhaps a Healer to un-curse you so you can drop
    the thing, and that's incredibly expensive.</p>

    <p>You mention on the new dye page that there is always a chance of failure
    for the process, but my experience is that this is not so.<br>
    <br>
    From where someone is 50% reliable to where they are 98%, there seems to be
    about a 20-30 point range. After that, the skill remains at ~98% for a very
    long time, perhaps 75 to 100 points, then it actually does become 100%.<br>
    <br>
    Sugardaddy has not failed in about 3 months, since his skill got above 390,
    and he does a great deal of dyeing. If there is something you know which I
    do not, would love to hear it. (380 is listed as a break point on the
    page, but if you got this number from me, I must have miscommunicated; the
    magic number is 390.)<br>
    <br>
    FYI, dyeing shirts, robes, shoes, etc., anything without AL is basically a
    freebie. Worst case, you mess up the color and have to do it again. There is
    never a magic damaging or negative AL problem, so no real reason to take
    such items to the best possible.<br>
    <br>
    Not sure you ever explicitly mentioned it, but there is never any adverse
    effect on the magic of an item.<br>
    <br>
    Loved the explanation on the armor types. If there is anything you need, or
    any experiments you need run, give me a holler. I can round up 50 plants and
    dye up a storm with no real problem.<br>

        <p>First Maggie,<br>
        May I say that you are one of the most Beautiful women in all of Dereth,
        and if you were on my server, I would ask you for a date.<br>
        <br>
        I also want to say that you have one of the greatest sites around, with
        loads of info on everything from Atlan Weapons to Zephyrs! I really love
        it, keep up the good work!<br>
        <br>
        Thanks, Gore

        I've been going back through my piles of old email, trying to catch up
        just a bit and realized I've never said thank you for such nice mail!
        So, thank you! Compliments on my looks, *and* my site. What more could
        anyone ask for?! :-)</font>
