    </strong><small>Sorry for the lack of updates this week. I've been busy making money. Just
    to show I haven't completely disappeared from sight, I have updated the <a href="../../Travel/maps3.htm">Dereth Maps</a> page with a link to
    AC-Caves, home of Crick's dungeon maps!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Also, just a quick correction to the latest
    newsletter. The Nexus Crytal dropped 4 Scintillating Gems in addition to the Nexus Core
    Gem, not 2.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 24, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New quest! Minerva of Moom recently acquired a Green Mire Yoroi Cuirass to
    match her fancy pants. I thought it was an ideal time to work up the quest to go along
    with the new Runway addition. Check out Maggie the Jackcat's version of the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/GMGrave.htm">Green Mire Grave</a>, and
    check out <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Minerva.htm">Minerva of
    Moom</a> on the Runway, telling the tale. Get out your sunglasses -- that's some green!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm" target="_top">Letters</a> updated:
    Aazhain answers what a girl needs to kill to get some nice clothes.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Past <a href="6Apr00Newsletter.htm">Newsletter</a>
    published. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 23, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Updated the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm" target="_top">Thorns of the

    Shadow Armor!</small></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 21, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I got a new hat! (Yes, I can't resist the moons, still.) Thanks to Minerva
    of Moom for the new duds!</small> <small>What could be better than getting new spiffy
    armor? How about a new addition to the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm" target="_top">Runway</a>? You'll
    really like all the cool stuff Danier has to share.<br>
    </small><br>
    <small>Lots of minor, misc. items added or attended to: <br>
    <br>
    Updated the broken links in the <a href="../../Travel/maps2.htm" target="_top">Town Maps</a> page. (Thanks to Wroth Ravel, Quartermaster of the Glendon
    Wood militia for pointing them out.) <br>
    <br>
    Added <em>Amuli</em> to the <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/Abbrev.htm" target="_top">Pronunciation Guide</a>. (Thanks to Aloxo Marot of Frostfell.) and started a
    list of spell abbreviations -- I was momentarily stumped by <em>TV</em>, True Value, the
    other day.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>New <a href="../Letters.htm" target="_top">Letters</a>!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Frore.htm" target="_top">Frore</a> quest with info on NPC being able to give quest items even with
    &quot;Do not accept...&quot; selected. Updated <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Hamud.htm" target="_top">Hamud's Pyreal
    Katar</a> icon to the newer green version.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added the Cracked Shard icon to the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm" target="_top">Shadow Armor</a>
    page.</small><strong><br>
    <br>
    </strong><small>Added the new <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Abyss.htm" target="_top">Meditations on
    the Abyss</a> to the the <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Texts.htm" target="_top">Texts</a> Section and updated the <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Parchmnt.htm" target="_top">Parchments</a>
    with a few additions.</small><br>
    <strong><br>
    <small>April 18, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>A treat! Azeraphel Lorekeeper, columist from the <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/" target="_blank">Crossroads of Dereth</a> site has
    graciously agreed to take a walk down the <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm" target="_top">Runway</a>!
    (Actually, he stood there casting massive True Value on his stuff so I could ID it!)
    Thanks Azeraphel, for the pics, and for the new cool sleeves!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 17, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>I know you'll all be pleased to know that I finished my taxes this
    weekend! </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Just a few minor updates on the site: finsihed the list of Heroes on the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm" target="_top">Thorns</a>
    page, and updated the <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Parchmnt.htm" target="_top">Parchments</a>
    section with source. If you don't want full quest spoilers, you might check this page. I
    do, however, give the full text of the parchments.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 15, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Ok, enough about these Shadows! Let's talk about clothes! Fashion mania
    has been sweeping Dereth (in between Shadow battles). In keeping with the high interest in
    the apparel of the land, I've created a new section called <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">The Runway</a> under the <a href="../../Apparel/apparel.htm">Apparel</a> section. View your
    fellow players modeling various Derethian outfits. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Big thanks to Jaide, the Shopping Dominatrix of Leafcull, for volunteering to be my
    first victim! </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If you'd like to be featured on the Runway, please <a href="../Form.htm">send me mail</a>.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions</small>:<br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm">Thorns</a>
    page with the names of more Dereth Heroes. Thanks to Ibn Schachabo of Leafcull for
    providing the additional names!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 14, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>The battle rages forward! The Shadows attack again, this time in the
    Livnak Range. See the updated <a target="_top" href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm">Thorns of the Hopeslayer</a>
    page for in-game broadcast messages and a partial list of Dereth Heroes. Thanks to Spot of
    Harvestgain for sending the evening's last message, just under the wire!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>If you know any of the names of the Dereth Heroes I am missing, please <a href="mailto:Maggie@thejackcat.com">send me email</a> with their game name and server.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 13, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Well, I've been busy, busy (It's this pesky job I have...), so very little
    updating lately. But there's been lotsa cool stuff going on; I'm sure you've gotten along
    fine without me for a few days! If you missed it, check out the transcript from the
    Developers' Chat last night on <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/library/reference/zonechat_000412.shtml" target="_blank">CoD</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>New <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> (I am such
    a bad Patron! Ha. Can somebody <em>please</em> give my vassal a Matty Coat?! )&nbsp; </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added a few new <a href="../../Travel/maps3.htm" target="_top">Map</a> links -- a labeled Dereth Map from Jonas at the RippednBuff monarchy
    and another Portal Route map from the Isido Kai monarchy!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added KOS to the <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/Abbrev.htm" target="_top">Abbreviations</a>.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added two of the new thumbnail pics for the Mana Charges in the <a href="../../Shopping/MagicItm.htm" target="_top">Magic Items</a>
    Section.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added a few more Goblets, etc. in the <a href="../../Shopping/4Table.htm" target="_top">For the Table</a>
    Section. (Gosh, I hope my server can handle the stampede!!)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Added a mention of the cooperation on Darktide
    during the Shadow attack on the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm" target="_top">Thorns of the
    Hopeslayer</a> page&nbsp; -- news courtesy of Vengor.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">I've also been meaning to mention what a fun
    time I've had meeting people in-game. My favorite line so far was from Minerva of Moom,
    whom I met several nights ago along with her friends Tygoth and Bayud. She said, &quot;You
    look just like your picture!&quot;</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 9, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Eeeeek! The Shadows have invaded! Brave heroes hold back the forces of
    darkness in another fabulous Turbine event. I've compiled a partial list of Dereth heroes
    on my <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Thorns.htm" target="_top">Thorns
    of the Hopeslayer</a> page of the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm" target="_top">Dereth History</a>
    section.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added the <a href="../../Culture/Texts/SoCSHist.htm" target="_top">Silifi of
    Crimson Stars: Vol I</a> history in the <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Texts.htm" target="_top">Texts</a>
    section. (I also fixed my misspelling of Devana while I was at it!)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Updated the <a href="../../Shopping/Locksmth.htm" target="_top">Locksmith</a> page
    with a few miscellaneous keys.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Updated the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm" target="_top">Shadow Armor</a>
    page with a few more stats, in response to some questions I received in some letters. Read
    my favorite: &quot;Does This Girth Make My Butt Look Big?&quot; in the updated <a href="../Letters.htm" target="_top">Letters Section</a>.
    Also included in the Letters update is a horrific tale of treachery, despair and thievery.
    Find out why I dub one Derethian &quot;Scumbag of the Year.&quot;</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>An enormous </small><strong>Thank You </strong><small>to
    Bob at the <a href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/links.asp" target="_blank">Zone</a>
    for adding a link to my site. You're the best, Bob! And congrats on your happy news!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 7, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Updated the <a href="../Letters.htm" target="_top">Letters</a> today, plus cleaned up a few inaccuracies here and there on the
    site! I apologize deeply to those who may have suffered, especially to... well, you know
    who you are! (I don't think you gave me your game name.) I also sent out my first issue of
    the <a href="../Newsletter.htm">Newsletter</a>, with the
    ENTIRE SILIFI OF CRIMSON STARS SPOILER!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Just kidding. It only had some gentle hints,
    much more appropriate for the age of the quest.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 5, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>An update! Yay! The Turbine sense of humor has struck the land of Dereth
    again! This charming message greets those players who were lucky enough to experience the
    permanent enchantment bug (now fixed): &quot;You hear faint gleeful laughter as your
    enchantments fade away.....&quot; Town criers exclaim enthusiastically about taking your
    money while giving no news! Not to mention the euphemistic manner they have to describe
    the mating habits of rabbits. Everybody and their brother has a different answer for where
    the new portals atop the spires go. And the quest campers have gotten Gertarh
    assassinated! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Rumors.htm" target="_top">Rumors</a> page with new sayings from Town Criers.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Shadows.htm" target="_top">Shadows</a> page with a few reported new sayings. (I haven't verified yet.)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Added the new COD Area Maps and Liz's collection
    of Dungeon Maps to the <a href="../../Travel/maps3.htm" target="_top">Dereth Maps</a> page.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added two new <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Texts.htm" target="_top">Texts</a>: <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Golems.htm" target="_top">The Golems</a> and <a href="../../Culture/Texts/Devanna.htm" target="_top">A Letter to
    Devanna</a>.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Revised the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm" target="_top">Quest Section</a> to
    reflect <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Gertarh.htm" target="_top">Gertarh's</a>
    changed status.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>April 4, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Maggie the Jackcat hereby apologizes to <a href="http://www.pcpunks.com/ac/" target="_blank">PCPunks</a> for any nasty things I may
    have said about you! A hearty thank you for removing the two quests that were used from my
    site so quickly! I completely understand how difficult it is to verify all the submissions

    forward to a long and prosperous relationship with many reciprocal links in our future!</small></font></p>
