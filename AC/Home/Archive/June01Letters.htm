    <b>June 18, 2001 - Niffis Info</b>
    <p>The Niffis pearls are dropped by level 20 Glissnal Niffis and level 42
    Opor Niffis. I personally believe I got my Small Niffis Shell off a Listris
    not Parfal. In all actuality they are probably dropped by both of those. I'd
    also like to point out that you may want to put the level of Sephal Niffis
    (60) so that an uninformed player doesn't venture out into the Dires and
    die. They have bad level 5 debuffs and an incredibly strong bludgeoning
    attack to boot. Just sharing my knowledge :)</p>

    <b>Update Information</b></p>
    <p>Maggie, got some info for you, on the patch. First off, all your hard
    work on vender rates just got flushed... down with the merchants consortium!
    Newbie towns are buying from us at 90%, and selling to us at 135%... and
    that's just about the best rates you get. Eastham is at 90% and 155%, Kara
    at 170% and 80%, and the Dires is dreadful... 70% to sell there, not sure
    about what they charge you to buy. These rates are uniform at ALL venders,
    though I have not checked out roaming peddlers yet. Secondly, Niffis drop
    pearls and shells now, though I haven't managed to get anything to show you.
    And in tribute to a dearly departed author we all know and love.. or
    should...&nbsp; you can now receive towels.<br>
    <br>
    All Mud Golems drop muddy towels, which you can turn in for nice clean
    towels at your nearest society rep... it's quite the thing to wander around
    in our clean white undies with a towel wrapped around our waists. And these
    are not ordinary towels... they change color when paired with a girth! You
    can also obtain wet towels rarely too from water golems, but when I turned
    mine in I got the same clean towel as a muddy.. don't know what it takes to
    get a green towel, I just hope it's not a coral golem that's dropping it! ;P<br>
    <br>
    Now here's the important info...<br>
    <br>
    When I first logged on I despaired, for I saw that it seemed our dye plants
    had not changed. BUT - I have an unconfirmed rumor that one can turn in their
    golden gromnies for purple dye plants! Yes, PURPLE! I will try and get more
    info on where this happens, and get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

    Thanks for all the great info. It was a real help to me when putting the

    again!! (just kidding!) Of course it won't be that bad since I have the
    names and coords already and will just be updating rates and prices. Thanks
    for getting me started.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Purple dye!? *swoon* I've been scouring the boards
    for more info on this delectable rumor. Sadly, however, I read that someone
    had admitted to making it up. I still hold out hope, though! We've all seen
    the Robe that <a href="../../Shopping/Bargains.htm">Vanten the Archmage</a> is
    wearing, over on the Vesayen isles. Someone, somewhere, holds the secret, I

    <p><b>June 18, 2001 - </b>
    <b>Quests &amp; Templates</b></p>
    <p>First off Let me just say your site is great. I remember when I first
    came into AC in late August 2001. I went to the Zone's Link page and tried
    out a bunch of the sites and I thought yours was the best :). I must say
    also, I really loved Danier's <a href="../../Careers/MageDanier.htm">How to
    Make &amp; Play a Mage</a> writing thing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2 other things. One is that you haven't made a write-up (although it
    doesn't need to be very long) of the new naming quest. And the only thing I
    find your site is wholly lacking is a thorough template guide and suggested
    templates. That's one thing I have noticed that other sites have -- I'll put
    it this way -- more developed. I bet Danier has some good templates up
    his sleeves (especially mage templates), and I know a lot of them myself,
    plus I have a lot of resources towards finding them.<br>
    <br>
    Also, this is a last thought just out of curiosity. I have never heard you
    mention the word Darktide on your site. Any particular reason? (and no I am
    not implying that I love Darktide)<br>
    <br>
    Keep up the good work!</p>

    <font color="#FFFF80">Hi Shadows Lurker -<br>
    Thank you for the nice compliments on the site. The naming quest is pretty
    simple and straightforward and I had most of it on the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Ways2.htm">Changing
    of the Ways</a> patch page already. When I have a little extra time, I'll
    reformat it and move it over into the quest section. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">Many people have requested more template info and
    it really is &quot;on the list.&quot; When I have to decide how to divvy up
    my limited time, I tend to focus on the most popular areas of the site, like
    the patch updates, the quests, the Letters and the Runway. (Ok, I've been
    slacking here, I know! ;) More coming soon!</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80">I don't have a lot about Darktide on the site,
    simply because I don't play on Darktide. There are others in the community
    who are better at reporting the goings-on. I do, however, have a small link
    section for <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/PvP.htm">PvP and Darktide</a>. See? It's
    nothing personal; I've got nothing against PK. Why I've been known to have
    become a cold hardened killer a time or two myself. ;-)</font></p>

    But the question I had is what are you wearing on the front page of your

    you wearing sleeves? Looks very cool. Thanks. =)<br>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Well the patch was today, and while
        searching for something to do to avoid boredom during the download I
        decided to check your site. It seemed there was a <a href="../../Ned/SETIndex.htm">new
        section</a>, with tips and advice from your infamous vassal, Ned
        Cleversun. I read the latest tip [on archers hunting groups of monsters]
        and had to comment on the line about it being totally useless to melee
        fighters. This is far from true as while fighting in the field I often
        keep a stack of thrown weapons [often dropped by creatures I'm hunting
        at the time] for use in the tactic Ned described. They almost always
        evade the first attack [tw untrained], but they still register that it
        occurred and everyone comes looking for you. Return to the group and
        spend one more thrown weapon on that same critter and it'll aspire to be
        your best friend in the world while the others could care less. It's
        very useful to fight a single tusker, drudge, banderling, shadow, etc.
        etc. The same works with wands that shoot war bolts, bows and xbows. I
        prefer thrown weapons.</font></p>

    <br>
    Hiya Maggie:<br>
    <br>
    Nice feature on your vassal's hunting tips, and would like to make comment
    on his last tip about firing at one monster.<br>
    <br>
    This is something an archer better learn, along with slide reloading, for
    survival. This tip also works for anyone with creature or life magic and
    using it to debuff the monsters.<br>
    <br>
    The melee fighters out there can also do this by using a range weapon skill
    untrained. Sure, going to miss, but the important thing is to try to hit the
    monsters, even if they evade. I've also used a wand and done the &quot;wand
    monkey&quot; on a monster to lure it out of a group with a melee fighter.<br>
    <br>
    Take care and look forward to seeing you again at the ACPL<br>

    As per Ned's latest sermon for archers... the same can be applied for
    wizards as well. Debuffs and spells on one creature the first time will lure
    them all, while a second debuff or attack will only attract the creature
    originally hit. *winks* Lone mages require this advantage if they plan to
