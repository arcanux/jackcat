      This is not something I discovered, but rather was told about.&nbsp; How

      and then hit the space bar to jump.&nbsp; It goes rather quick, but you do
      a back flip.&nbsp; This info was from a character on Leafcull by the name

    The following series of letters refer to another case of a site lifting my
    content and passing it off as their own. They even went so far as to put
    their own copyright notice on my pages! I have a form letter I send out
    about once or twice a week (a little less often since the site got more
    popular) asking sites to
    remove my content. In almost every instance, the response is, &quot;I'm
    sorry, I didn't realize, I'll remove it right away.&quot; Occasionally, I'll
    run into a less pleasant attitude. My first public run-in was, of course,
    with PCPunks. In that case, the situation was a bit different; it was done
    unintentionally and we resolved it quickly and with little bloodshed! ;-)</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Other battles, though, have proved to be
      less pleasant, as many of you know. I haven't really mentioned some of the
      more recent incidents on the site because I figured most people would like
      to read about fun things, not the boring tedium of the back-end crap work.
      But then, I thought, why should I discriminate against EpiK?! All
      offenders should get the benefit of my public scorn! Ha. Actually, the
      reason I'm mentioning this latest incident with the Ftuoils is because
      there were unintended consequences to our disagreement.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">When the Ftuoils refused, quite
      unpleasantly, to remove my content, their host, ACSage, stepped in
      immediately and shut them down. The Ftuoils then started a thread on
      Asheron's Lore to say nasty things about me. Several people, reading the
      thread, mistakenly took my disagreement with the Ftuoils to be a
      disagreement with ACSage! When ACSage was down for server maintenance
      recently, some even thought that I, or other sites, had taken legal action
      against them to have ACSage shut down!&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Nothing could be further from the truth.
      I'd just like to take this opportunity to publicly thank <a href="http://www.acsage.com/" target="_blank">ACSage</a>
      for their quick response to my request and to clear up any lingering
      misinformation. It's a sign of their
      professionalism and integrity that they recognize how vital it is to the
      AC community that original content be protected. Their complete
      unwillingness to host content taken from other sites is praiseworthy. So
      deepest thanks once again to Kadran and Fizzle and the other members of
      ACSage. I had a high opinion of your site before this incident, and have
      an even higher one now.</font>

      Hello Maggie!<br>
      <br>
      I have been a long-time reader of your site and have occasionally conversed with your lovely vassal Ned about archery (Hi Ned!)  Your site is quite wonderful and I recommend it to everyone I know!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I really don't know how you find the time... I have a few  stories published at my website which I update about once every few months:
      <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/black.star/purple/ac.html" target="_blank">http://freespace.virgin.net/black.star/purple/ac.html</a><br>
 But it is really nothing to compare to your fabulous site :)<br>
      <br>
      Anyway the real point of this letter is to ask you to update the coordinates for the Shadow Armor Crafters.  I know it says "they are now by the lifestones" but would it be possible to put in the exact coords?  I can tell you that Jibril ibn Rashid is actually at 7.1N, 3.0E in Al-Jalima.<br>
      <br>
      I know this because I ran to the coords I read from your site clutching my  scintillating gem and discovered my crafter wasn't there!  This was potentially
      disastrous on Darktide (especially because CoD also has the wrong coords) but  thankfully, I found him eventually and got my gorgeous pants.  Now to save up for the top!<br>
      <br>
      Thank you very much for your time and keep up the great work!<br>

      It's nice to hear from you. Ned has mentioned you several times before and
      it was fun to read a little bit about your characters in AC. I've updated
      the Al-Jalima and the Kara coords. I still need to verify the Eastham
      coords. Thanks for the reminder and congratulations on your pants! Thanks,
