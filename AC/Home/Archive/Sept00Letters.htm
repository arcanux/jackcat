      another way if someone else is already there.<br>
      <br>
      Outside of town, just a couple of mintues, is a dungeon. The outside of
      the dungeon has Tumeroks, but ashes, gold wasps, and other nasties spawn
      around the dungeon. If you go inside (more Tumeroks), you can tie to the
      exit portal. You can then go and summon for your friends. Just make sure
      everyone hits the ground running when they go through the portal. :)<br>

      I have portaled several people to a &quot;Cave&quot;&nbsp; about 16 total
      clicks from Ayan. I believe this is the safest way to Ayan. (One of which
      was my level 28 vassal.) I don't have the exact coords, but there are a
      lot of Tumeroks inside and outside the cave.<br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dear Maggie,<br>
      <br>
      I always enjoy reading your letters page, and I particularly liked the
      letters (Sept. 12) from Withheld, the player who both is and is not a
      member of Clan EpiK.<br>
      <br>
      I respect and am sensitive to Withheld's disability, and hope he (or she)
      is able to resolve the uncertainty about their allegiance. But I cannot
      agree with his (or her) judgment about web sites and web design. Withheld
      asserted that the Clan EpiK web site is better than yours.<br>
      <br>
      Now, I know it will pain you to think that I entertained any doubt about
      the superiority of Maggie the Jackcat's kick-ass fabulous Asheron's Call
      web site. It's true that I have been nurtured here, and few AC players
      have had a site as nice as this built just for them by their Patron!
      (Actually, I don't think *any* AC player has a site as good as the one
      you've made for me. I like it a lot.)<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the world is a curious and passing strange place, with
      improbable phenomena and peculiar contradictions. And one can't know a
      thing -- not really, truly, hope-to-die know -- until one has checked. So
      I, er, went there. To the EpiK site.<br>
      <br>
      It is not better than yours.</font></p>

      You know, All this carp you keep talking about clan EpiK is getting way
      out of control. When they originally posted things from your site, they
      did give you full credit and even posted a link to your web page. I know
      because I was looking for quest guides one day and found the EpiK site and
      followed a link to your page.<br>
      <br>
      I must say that I will NEVER return to your site again because I think you
      are a immature, spoiled, self rightous piece of shit for trying to destroy
      someone over something so petty.<br>
      <br>
      I really think you need to grow up and get a life, after all this is only
      some stupid game. Why do you take it so serious?<br>

      2.&nbsp; Take the portal at the bottom of Sylsfear or Carved Caves to the

      3.&nbsp; Portal to Nexus, then run south along the shore to Ayan Baqur..

      4.&nbsp; Take the Mayoi to South Dires portal.. yuck.<br>

      Basically, if you are looking for a fast and or easy to do it, forget it.
      Of all the stuff mentioned here, the safest is Sylsfear / Carved Caves to

        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">&quot;It used to be that the
        ONLY way to reach Ayan Baqur was to run from the South Direlands portal
        (62.2S 77.1E start point near mayoi, drops out at 82.2S 34.4W in South
        Direlands). That's how I reached Ayan Baqur originally, and it wasn't
        too bad. It was also possible, and still is, to run from a portal in the
        disaster maze area, but it was always a long and dangerous haul.</font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Looking in AC Explorer,
        there may now be a couple of alternatives, but I haven't checked them
        out. Using the &quot;route&quot; function, I routed to Ayan Baqur from
        Mayoi and got&nbsp;a very interesting route, but it still required a 25
        click run from a portal on the rim of the Obsidian Plain.</font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">However, I discovered one
        other very interesting item buried in the depths of AC Explorer. It DID
        NOT show up in the routing functions, so it is suspect, but there was a
        personal note from a well-known player (Dr. Feelgood) in the AC Explorer
        database. There is a dungeon North of Hall of Metos and Black Spawn Den,
        called The Cave. It is located at 47.8S 83.7W and is exactly 12.81
        clicks North of Ayan Baqur. Here is a copy/paste of the note from Dr.
        Feelgood: This is the start of Sunshine's Way: a shorter route to Ayan
        Baqur than running in from the South Direland Coast or Disaster Maze
        area.&nbsp; &nbsp;-- Doc Feelgood 6/6/2000</font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">That suggests to me that the
        dungeon can be tied. If it can, then it's the closest portal to Ayan
        Baqur, by far. BUT ...you need to GET there first, hahaha. Right now I'd
        say that the shortest publicly available route is:<br>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#FFFF80">&quot;By the way, I did a
      sort of informal poll at Ayan Baqur, amongst the layabouts and gallants
      standing around in town. The consensus seems to be that Nexus (40.1S
      79.2W) is the best place to tie for Ayan Baqur. Nexus is the place, Nexus,
      Nexus, Nexus. But Nexus requires a run of over 21 clicks of hard ground. I
      think this &quot;Sunshine Way&quot; (The Cave) is a better deal, being
      less than 12 clicks away.&quot;</font>
