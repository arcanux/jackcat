    FIRST EDITION<br>
    -----------------------------------------------<br>
    Welcome to the first edition of Maggie the Jackcat's Irregular AC News! Like web sites, I
    expect this to be an evolving project, but for now, I envision it to be a weekly to
    bi-monthly note about newsworthy things in the AC World, sent out whenever I have time or
    the inclination. Plus, it will give me a chance to plug special features of my site! I'll
    try to keep it short and sweet, so you're not tempted to delete me from your inbox!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>-----------------------------------------------<br>
    NEW QUEST: THE SILIFI OF CRIMSON STARS!<br>
    -----------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small>From the game manual: <br>
    &quot;Wari al-Sha'im was a follower of the nobleman Musansayn, and helped the renowned
    leader stake out a homeland among the mesas and dunes of western Oseth. When peace came,
    however, Wari chose to leave: he had been a fighting man for nearly forty years, and could
    live no other life. He bade his master farewell and struck out across the trackless sands
    of the a'mun Desert. He took only a few possessions with him: his scale armor, his shield,
    and the Silifi of Crimson Stars.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The Silifi was an ancient artifact from the
    Gharu'ndim homeland, having once belonged to the Malika Ladriya bint Daum. Known by its
    scarlet markings, it was swift and sharp, and it crackled with the electricity of a
    slumbering storm. Wari won it from a renegade Shayk in his youth, and carried it with him
    all his life. He is said to have lost the weapon at last in a dungeon deep beneath the
    sands, where he finally met his doom. The Silifi surely remains in those depths, awaiting
    a new wielder with the courage to bring it back to sunlit lands.&quot;</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">No, I'm not going to cough up a completed quest
    quite so soon! Have to give the industrious and clever a chance to earn their glory, after
    all. But for those looking for hints,&nbsp;the fabled axe is broken, and is in need of
    repair. The Crimson Stars are glorious Rubies, scattered throughout the desert, which
    imbue the weapon with magical powers. Their names are:</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Al-Shajar, named for the storm-demon in
    the old stories, should allow he who carries it to feel not the pains of lightning. The
    ruby al-Khur, which is named for the warlord known as the Eagle, should cause the blade to
    cut to the quick. . Yujazik, named for the flaming mountain the court of the old gods was
    built upon, should protect the bearer from the pains of fire. Mahwan, which is named for
    the citadel upon Yujazik, should enable its bearer to parry more blows. Sulmada, named for
    the old god of dance, should increase the agility of he who wields it.&quot; </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Alas, the blade is no more, but enterprising
    folk are finding a way to restore the axe to its rightful purpose by using the&nbsp;spine
    of a desert creature. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To learn more, find&nbsp;Kayna bint Iswas, a
    desert crafter, for she knows the secrets of the Silifi of the Crimson Stars.&nbsp;</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">To see some of Dereth's finest with their
    restored weapons, visit CoD's Thorns of the Hopeslayer pictorial:</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">And nope! I still don't know what's in the
    Nexus!! Except for a very locked door.</font></small></p>

    TIDBITS<br>
    -----------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small>Thanks to Caeryn Dryad, Equipment Editor extraordinaire at CoD, for this tidbit on
    the Shadow Armor: </small><br>
    <small><br>
    <font color="#800000"><b>WARNING:</b> Giving a third Gem after you have given two similiar
    ones earlier will NOT yield Leggings (and Celdon) again. Instead the Smith will keep it.
    At this moment it is yet known if the flag will be reset in time.</font></small></p>

    AC SITES IN THE NEWS<br>
    -----------------------------------------------<br>
    PC Punks was in the news for using Maggie the Jackcat's Frore and Altar of Bael'Zharon
    quests on their site. After she publicly exposed them with the cheeky charge of &quot;You
    suck!&quot;, the site editor graciously took them down, explaining how difficult it is to
    verify all sources. Maggie apologized to PC Punks and all was right in the world again.
    But as a result of this misunderstanding, I did get my first piece of hate mail! If you
    missed it, head on over to the new Letters Section for a peek! Made me laugh.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small><a href="../Letters.htm">http://www.thejackcat.com/AC/Home/Letters.htm</a></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Asheron's Call Tips</small><br>
    <a href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/"><small>http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/</small></a><br>
    <small>Big news at Asheon's Call Tips. Pop on over and check out their fabulous new look!
    They even have a pretty new banner! Since the first day I discovered this site, I've had
    it on my favorites list. I use it again and again to find the best game resources around.
    A very special thanks to Silverion for the wonderful support he's given to my fledgling
    site -- even placing&nbsp;it &quot;In the Spotlight!&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>AC Trade Post</small><br>
    <small><a href="http://www.actradepost.com/">http://www.actradepost.com/</a><br>
    Another great site to hit the scene is AC Trade Post, a place to buy, sell, or trade your
    cool AC stuff. They've had an unfortunate rocky start with some hosting issues, but it
    hasn't seemed to slow them down a bit! If you're looking for a place to trade those Sword
    Mastery Gloves V that you have no use for, this could just be the place for you! </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Or, ahem, you could @tell Maggie the Jackcat, on Thistledown.
    ;-)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>ACQuery<br>
    <a href="http://members.xoom.com/CrusadeSoft/">http://members.xoom.com/CrusadeSoft/</a></small><br>
    <small>A public version of ACQuery has been released with no registration required. I
    haven't tried it out yet, but I see at least one command that looks pretty useful to me:
    @corpse !! If you've tried it out and have things to say, good or bad, send me a line.</small></font></p>

    <small>MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS AC SITE NEWS!</small><br>
    <small>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small>I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who's visited my site
    since I made it public a little over two weeks ago. The site has been a great success
    with&nbsp;more than&nbsp; a half million hits and over 15,000 visitors! And I'd especially
    like to thank everyone who wrote me such encouraging and wonderful mail. I love all your
    suggestions and would love to implement them all, sooner or later. For right now, I'll
    have to give you my standard response: I'll get right on it!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Many people&nbsp;have asked if they could help contribute
    information. The answer is, of course, a resounding YES! If you have shots of items you
    know I'm missing -- really cool armor &amp; weapons, screen shots of Quest items, the new
    non-twinkie-ized pyreal bars/motes, etc., a Shadow Stone, an Atlan Mace, or anything else
    you think I'd like (I'm a sucker for those cute goblets and plates, too)&nbsp; -- send
    them to <a href="mailto:pics@thejackcat.com">pics@thejackcat.com</a>.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Non-compressed .jpg format is preferred.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>See you in the game!</small></font></p>
