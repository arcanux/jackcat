      <font face="Arial" size="2">All that work on the Shopping section has
      turned my mind once again to fashion! I thought I'd catch up with another
      Runway participant to see <a href="../../Apparel/WhereNow.htm">Where Are They
      Now</a>? Read all about <a href="../../WhereNow/Roberto.htm">Roberto-Eduardo</a>
      and the tragedy that occurred on the route to obtaining his Greater Shadow

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I also decided it's time to
      clean up some of the older pages and update them a bit. I started with the
      <a href="../../Apparel/Head.htm">Head</a>&nbsp; page of the <a href="../../Apparel/Armor.htm">Armor</a>
      section. These pages are only meant to be a sampling of the armor
      available in the game. As an additional note, I don't actually physically
      have these pieces on my mules. So please, don't ask me to twink or trade!
      ;-)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I say this quite often, but
      think it bears repeating in case you've missed my earlier explanations
      about my bulging Inbox. Thank you to everyone who has sent me mail. It's
      become almost impossible for me to keep up with it and to respond to
      everyone individually.&nbsp; If you don't hear back from me, it doesn't
      mean that I don't love you! I appreciate all the helpful tips, letters and
      suggestions, so please keep them coming. I try hard to update the site

      you something... few players understand death as well as Ned Cleversun.&quot;
      ;-) And Congratulations on Level 62! Although I've been on a killing
      rampage, Ned Cleversun has still managed to increase the level gap to 22.
      But as they say, a rising tide floats all boats. For the first time ever,
      Ned Cleversun has surpassed the Loyalty bar first set by Danier: up a
      point to 148! Thanks Ned. You're the best vassal EVER!!</font></p>

      the quests before some of the changes made in the last patch or two, some
      of the values for items may be incorrect (most of the &quot;free&quot;
      ones were changed to 0). In addition, you are now given an announcement

      talismans. Thanks to Fu' Leng of the Elder clan for the correction. Thanks
      also to Gheres Reficul for pointing out that my <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Caulnalain.htm">Crystal-tip
      arrows &amp; quarrels</a> were pointing to my hard drive. The icons should
      now be appearing. I also corrected the titles of a few pages thanks to
      Gadaric. I know there are broken links in the Maps section (mainly because
      of the CoD revamp!) and plan to correct those in the near future. I
