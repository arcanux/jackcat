      Last, as I've mentioned, I plan to start doing <a href="../../Apparel/Runway.htm">Runway</a>
      updates again. Because so many of the Runway volunteer requests are soooo
      outdated and many of the people I've tried to contact either no longer
      play, or have re-rolled and started someone new, I've decided to start
      from scratch taking Runway Volunteers. It was just the easiest solution I
      could think of to handle it. That means if you've previously sent a
      request in, you'll need to <a href="../Form.htm">re-send one</a>, even if you
      asked just last week. I will do my best to try and start with people who
      have already requested being featured, and apologize in advance to anyone
      who gets overlooked. Remember that good pages highlight not just fashion,
      but interesting stories and personalities. Any information about your
      character or your game-play that you'd like to add in your letter is much
      appreciated.&nbsp;</font></p>
