    </strong><small>New Section! I've started a Letters Section to share some of the fabulous
    mail I've gotten since making the site public two weeks ago. To start, I've published
    letters from Draax of Leafcull and Brian Boru' of Harvestgain, two adventurers seeking the
    riches of the Lost City of Frore -- one of the site's most popular Quest Guides. Read them
    <a href="../Letters.htm">here</a>! </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">I'd also like to thank ACVault, Asherons Lore,
    and Vincent Price, creator of the Mite Maze Map, for links to my site.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>March 29, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>In answer to the numerous queries: I play on Thistledown. I've been having
    a little ISP trouble lately, also. So if I don't answer your mail right away, it doesn't
    mean that I don't love you!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>New quests! Find out other paths to evil besides the newbie fooling &quot;v&quot;
    trickery. Maggie the Jackcat presents the PK quest: <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/PKAltar.htm" target="_top">Altar of
    Bael'Zharon</a>! And when the prodigal son wishes to return to the fold, check out the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Asheron.htm" target="_top">Altar of
    Asheron</a> quest.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>The ongoing chore of cleaning up the spelling
    errors from my atrocious typing continues!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>March 27, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>You may have noticed a slight alteration to the front page. I sent the URL
    of my site to the Zone to be added to their AC Links, but was told that although humorous,
    some of the content was not suitable for a general audience! Since I hadn't really
    expected the site to be as popular as it is, I wasn't too concerned about the End of the
    World &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; screen shot before now (I claimed that it portrayed me and my
    vassal getting a little frisky as we waited for the end of the world). However, the site
    has begun to get quite heavy traffic. Therefore, in my quest for a G Rating (or at least
    PG) and higher box office returns, I have removed that page. Besides, I was getting a
    little miffed that it continued to be one of the most frequently viewed pages day after
    day, while something like the charming <a href="../../Apparel/MageRobe.htm" target="_top">Mage Robe Adventure</a>
    only got a few dozen hits!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added a button on the home page so my fans can more easily send me mail! :-) Thanks
    to Toejoe of Leafcull for the suggestion. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>That's it. Had to watch the Oscars, you know! Anyway, I gave you that great Atlan
    Weapon Guide the other day; that should hold you for a bit. Don't want you to get spoiled!</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong>March 25, 2000</strong></small><br>
    <small>Being famous has its rewards! Now, instead of the previous most frequently heard
    line: &quot;Do you want/need a Patron?&quot; I am actually having people ask, &quot;Can I
    be your vassal?&quot; Maggie the Jackcat is humbled. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added the latest broadcast message to the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Spires.htm" target="_top">Shadow Spires</a>
    page, along with a link to Abrim's abduction and some new spire coordinates.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Fixed some egregious spelling errors on the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Atlan.htm">Atlan Weapons</a> page.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Updated the <a href="../../Apparel/Sleeve.htm">Sleeves</a>
    and <a href="../../Apparel/Coat.htm">Coats</a> Armor pages with
    some Amuli &amp; Celdon stats.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added a few new <a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/Abbrev.htm">abbreviations</a>
    and added &quot;Impious&quot; to the pronunciation guide. (I was quite chagrined to
    discover I've been pronouncing the word wrong for years!)</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><small>March 24, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>New Quest! Mary the Mad beat me to the punch on the newsgroup earlier
    today, but the information's certainly worth repeating. Get Maggie the Jackcat's spin on
    the Atlan Weapons <a target="_top" href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Atlan.htm">here</a>! </small><br>
    <br>
    <strong><small>March 23, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Once again, Maggie the Jackcat would like to express her appreciation for
    all the wonderful fan mail! It's obvious that the site is attracting the most intelligent
    and discerning ACers on the web! I particularly liked how some of you would delineate the
    specific aspects of the site you found particularly appealing. I am grateful for your
    generous praise. One fan suggested that I place a more prominent button on the front page
    for people to know where to send me mail. I thought I'd give it a test run here:</small></font></p>

    down tomorrow, I promise!</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>New Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added a page on the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Spires.htm" target="_top">Shadow Spires</a>
    under the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Dereth.htm" target="_top">Dereth
    History</a> section, complete with coordinates and links to recent abduction tales.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>March 22, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Ask and ye shall receive! Thanks to all who sent fan mail to Maggie the
    Jackcat. I certainly appreciated all the kind words. I told my vassal how responsive you
    were and he said, &quot;Really? Can you get me a Matty Coat?&quot; (Just kidding. He
    didn't really say that.)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>New Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added a <a href="../../Hobbies/Magic/Research.htm" target="_top">Spell Research</a> Primer under the <a href="../../Hobbies/Magic.htm" target="_top">Magic</a> Section.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Fixed some minor spelling errors.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><strong><small>March 20, 2000</small><br>
    </strong><small>Just some miscellaneous updating today. The site is still getting some
    nice traffic. I know you like it because you continue to visit and even stay a while. And
    some of you like it <em>so much</em> that you have lifted entire sections already and
    mirrored them on your own sites!! (I know who you are and I am watching you, you sneaky
    fellow!!! I have Item now, so you had better watch it!) But nobody calls; nobody writes.

    <br>
    <small>Send your fan mail <a href="mailto:Maggie@thejackcat.com">here</a>!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>New Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Added Small Shadow Children, Statics etc., and Dual Fragments to the <a href="../../Pets/beasties.htm" target="_top">Beasties</a> list</small>.<br>
    <br>
    <small>Added a handful of magical clothing to the <a href="../../Apparel/Designer.htm" target="_top">Designer Wear</a>
    Section. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added the stats of a Linen Kasa to the <a href="../../Apparel/Clothing.htm" target="_top">Clothing</a>
    Section!! (I know you're all going to hop right on over.)<br>
    <br>
    Added a few more <a href="../../Sports/sword.htm" target="_top">Swords</a>,
    <a href="../../Apparel/Legging.htm" target="_top">Leggings</a> and <a href="../../Apparel/Breast.htm" target="_top">Breastplates</a>

    <strong><br>
    <small>March 19, 2000</small></strong><br>
    <small>Maggie the Jackcat's first week available to the public was a success! Thanks to
    Cassie at <a href="http://www.crackednuts.net/woac/" target="_top">WOAC</a> for making
    this the site of the week! Thank you also to <a href="http://cod.xrgaming.net/" target="_top">COD</a> for putting a link in their Other Realms section, and thanks for
    Siverion at <a href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/" target="_top">AC Tips &amp; Links</a>
    for several listings and for special news mention.<br>
    </small><br>
    <small>There were 1137 visitors to the site for the week. The most popular pages (besides
    the home page of course) were the <a target="_top" href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm" target="_top">quest </a>section --
    in particular, the <a target="_top" href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Frore.htm" target="_top">Frore</a>
    quest, the <a target="_top" href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm" target="_top">Shadow Armor</a> page and the &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; picture [removed]. (You
    guys crack me up.) Sadly, very few people appreciated my careful cataloging of the various
    <a target="_top" href="../../Shopping/4Table.htm" target="_top">Flagons</a>
    available in the game! </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Ya, you would think I have too much time on my hands! But the truth is that in
    &quot;real life&quot;, I work a highly demanding job with long, long hours; therefore, the
    updating of the site may go slow. I'll leave the daily AC news to those better suited to
    it, and will use this page to keep you posted about what I've added here.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>New Additions:</small><br>
    <small>Screen Shot of the <a target="_top" href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Frore2.htm" target="_top">Frore Memorial</a>
    added to the Frore quest -- thanks to Justin M. Harrison for the pic!</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Screen Shot of the <a target="_top" href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SOLL2.htm" target="_top">Sword of Lost
    Light</a> added to the SOLL quest -- thanks to Raiden aka Elemental Eclipse for the pic!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Link to <a href="http://www.tip.it/wizard/ac/" target="_top">Asheron
    Tips and Links</a> added to the Yellow Pages (sorry for the delay, Silverion).</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Added a picture of Ned Smacking his Head in the <a target="_top" href="../../odds&apos;nends/oddsends.htm" target="_top">Odds &amp; Ends</a>
    section from the early levels, when experimenting with Fun-with-Emotes.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Added a <a target="_top" href="../NewStuff.htm" target="_top">New Stuff</a> page to
    keep you informed about updates to the site! (I know. That's sort of like the Town Criers
    telling you that Town Criers are available to tell you news. A little meta-meta something
    or other.)</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Renamed the What's New Page to New Stuff Page and made the
    link more obvious on the home page.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Finished the <a target="_top" href="../../Shopping/MagicItm.htm" target="_top">Magic Items</a>
