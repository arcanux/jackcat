        <p>Hello Maggie <br>
        <br>
        You host a fabulous page. Many thanks for your hard work. <br>
        <br>
        I read in this patch update about the use of paper dolls to use mana 
        stones upon. I searched and searched and could not find a walk through 
        on where to get one of these new items. Might you point me &amp; your many 
        fans in the right direction? Thanks<span lang="en-us">.</span><br>

    Hi <span lang="en-us">Footslow</span> -<br>
        <span lang="en-us">I meant to get this letter up sooner. I was amazed at 
    how many people wrote to me, asking me how to get a Paper Doll. You actually 
    already have one! The paper doll is a general gaming term for the picture of 
    your character in your inventory screen (not you in the game world, fighting 
    monsters, but the pic of you to the right of your screen, surrounded by your 
    jewelry slots). All you have to do is double-click on your mana stone, then 
    click on the pic of yourself! Thanks for the compliments, and I hope that 
    helps! It's a great new feature!</span></font></p>

    <p>Hey Maggie!<br>

    In case you hadn't heard before, your site is a great source of info! What I 
    really wa<span lang="en-us">n</span>t to know however is<span lang="en-us">:</span><br>
    <br>
    A) Did you use raw HTML in the site's making for Frontpage or anything in 
    Frontpage's liking, or did you make it period?<br>
    <br>
    B) I want to have my AC II <span lang="en-us">site</span> to be like yours<span lang="en-us">.</span>
    <span lang="en-us">N</span>o <span lang="en-us">I'</span>m not g<span lang="en-us">o</span>nna 
    take your entire format, put it on my site and call it Chris' Game Zone. 
    Everyone comments on your information being great, and I think I'm dedicated 
    enough to have a site as dense of information as yours<span lang="en-us">.</span> 
    I just want to know if you think my site has those capabilities (<span lang="en-us">I</span>t 
    lacks info, well, because, this is pre-release<span lang="en-us">.</span>
    <span lang="en-us">U</span>pon release I will have atlases, lore, stats, 
    Bestiary, weapons, quests, etc).<br>
    <br>
    C) Lastly, how did everyone come to know your site so well<span lang="en-us">?</span> 
    I never see any links to it and the only reas<span lang="en-us">o</span>n I 
    know it so well if because an RL/AC friend showed me<span lang="en-us">.</span>
    <span lang="en-us">H</span>ow did <span lang="en-us">yo</span>u get everyone 
    to come here?<br>

    have.</p>

    <p><span lang="en-us"><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Forceful Chris -<br>
    Good luck on your new site! I've already received a whole mess of people 
    asking my opinion about their new AC2 sites, but it's really much too early 
    to give critiques! After the game is out and your site has been going at it 
    a few months, ask me again, and I'll be happy to look it over and give you 
    my opinion. </font></span></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">[Speaking of much too early... 
    THANK YOU very much to the many, many, many of you, asking to 1) be my 
    vassal in AC2, and 2) asking to be my Patron in AC2. I'm afraid at this 
    time, however, I must decline all requests! Ha. You guys crack me up! ;-)]</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">I can answer your other 
    questions, though. I do use Frontpage for my site. The main reason is 
    because it's fast! I can easily import spreadsheets (which I do regularly), 
    or integrate databases (which I haven't on this site so far, but it's easy 
    enough to do). I'm not an expert hand coder of HTML, but I know enough to 
    get by. It just takes a LOT longer. (I know a lot of the hard core coders 
    are now cringing unbearably! ;-) Time constraints are the biggest issue for 
    me, so Frontpage was the way to go. Good coding is nice and all, but I'm 
    sure you've heard the phrase: content is king.</span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">How did I get everyone to come 
    here? If you build it... they will come! (I stole that line from a movie!) 
    Word of mouth, mostly. I've never really advertised it on the other big 
    sites' news pages. There are plenty of links around, though, and most of 
    those have a link to me, as do many allegiance sites. My biggest referring 
    site is the Zone, believe it or not! Then Google, and the ACVault boards and 
    ACTips. For whatever reason, I've still been unable to get a link on the 
    official Microsoft AC pages. They can just bite me! (I'm sure that just 
    helped my case! ;-) Haha. </span></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99"><span lang="en-us">Remember, the site didn't happen 
    overnight. I've been doing this for over 2 years, a few hours here, a few 
    hours there. I started with 133,000 page views in my first full month, and 
    during the DM release had over 12.8 million for the month! </span></font>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">It's a little easier for me now 
    that I have so much awesome help, but still, it's been a tremendous amount 
    of work over time. I think that if you keep at it, and more importantly, 
    *enjoy* what you're doing, you'll build something that others will enjoy 
    too! I look forward to seeing yours and many more amazing sites in the 
    future!</font></span></p>

    <p>I'm curious about your feelings about AC2. Will you be starting over on AC2, 
    or sticking with ACprime. My daughter doesn't want to switch, but I'm a tech

    It would also be interesting to know how many people will be sticking with

    <p><br>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Hi Yoshi Kwang -<br>
    I can't possibly answer the 2nd question about how many people will leave AC 
    for AC2. I can't even really answer the first yet. Here is what I suspect 
    will happen, based on my previous experience of switching from Ultima Online 
    to Asheron's Call. I played UO for quite a long time -- Grand Master 
    Warrior, Grand Master Fletcher (I think those were my titles. It's *really* 
    been a while). I had my house, my vendors (quite a successful little 
    operation -- I sold regs, runes, XBows, Greater Heal Potions? I think. I 
    can't *believe* I can't remember this stuff!). The game was starting to get 
    to be a drag for me. I'd log on, restock my vendors, boost back up the 
    skills that had decayed, then... I was out of time! (I *hated* the skill 
    decay in UO). Since I actually do have very little free time, no matter what 
    many of you who visit this site seem to think ;-), this was just no good. 
    Where was the fun? Where was the adventure? Stock the store, boost the 
    stats; stock the store, boost the stats. After a while, it felt like a JOB! 
    And, really, I get enough work at work. </font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">A friend of mine who first got me 
    playing UO convinced me to sign up for some beta he heard about. I got in; 
    he didn't. I'd send him email: OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS SO COOL!!! P.S. Can 
    you pleeeze refresh my house for me??? I would alternate play days: one day 
    in Britannia, the next in Dereth. Eventually, I found myself spending more 
    and more time in Dereth, and less and less in Britannia. When I realized 
    that I probably hadn't logged into UO in several months, I finally cancelled 
    the account. But it was HARD! I was attached to my UO life. Sort of. </font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">UO tried hard to get me back! They 
    would send me emails, saying, your character has not yet been purged, it's 
    not too late! Then: your character may be purged. Then: your character is 
    gonna be purged, we are going to KILL YOU OFF FOREVER, but it's NOT TOO 
    LATE, send money NOW! Agghhhh! I couldn't resist! Not my little UO sprite 
    me! But, alas, it was not to be. It had been so long, my downloads and stuff 
    were all outdated, and I couldn't log in properly. Faced with the 
    pain-in-the-ass next step of having to seek out tech support, I said screw 
    it. (Let that be a lesson to you, Zone! We find it hard to leave, but we 
    should find it *easy* to come back! ;-)</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Er... what was your question 
    again? :-) Oh yes! Will I leave AC for AC2? Who knows! I suspect I will keep 
    a foot in both worlds initially, and one of them will eventually win me 
    over. I'm not at the point in AC that I was in UO. AC doesn't bore me. I 
    think it's fun. I have stronger social ties in-game. I am probably more 
    heavily invested in AC than I was in UO (the web site and all, plus my 
    legion of adoring fans ;-). I think that I'll find it difficult, time-wise, 
    to devote my attention to two different games long term. I'm sure a lot of 
    my decision will be based on where my good friend plays. I could even end up 
    in Norrath one day! (hee hee) </font></span></p>

    Hi Maggie,<br>
    I recently went back to the Fire Prism Dungeon, in hopes that the timer was 
    up after one month. It was. I got my prism, and turned it into the Agent of 
    Arcanum. This is what he said: Agent of the Arcanum tells you, &quot;Wow! You 
    were able to navigate that place again. Great Job! We are not giving repeat 
    offenders the Writs, but everything else is still available.&quot;<br>

    I haven't heard the curtain rumor. There's been a lot of speculation about 
    an Ursuin Rug that was shown in a teaser screenshot, but it hasn't yet made 
    it into the game. When that does, I suspect it will be one of the crafted

    Well, it wouldn't be a Letters section if I didn't indulge myself by 
    publishing a few &quot;effusive praise&quot; letters. Thank you very much for the 
    enthusiastic appreciation. I'm glad you like the site!</span></font></p>

    <p>Dear Maggie,<br>
    I recently completed the quest for the second time<span lang="en-us">.</span> I<span lang="en-us">,</span> however<span lang="en-us">,</span> did<span lang="en-us">
    </span>something slightly different. After retrieving the letter from the<span lang="en-us">
    </span>Reformed Bandit's house near Holtburg, I spoke to the Bandit again<span lang="en-us">.</span>
    <span lang="en-us">H</span>e<span lang="en-us"> </span>replied with the following:<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#66FF99">The &quot;reformed&quot; bandit has an extremely guilty look on his face. He even<br>
    looks as if he might run for the hills.</font><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Reformed Bandit tells you, &quot;Look! Behind you! Is that the white bunny?!&quot;<br>
    </font><font color="#D6D2DD">Reformed Bandit says, &quot;Shurov Thiloi!&quot;</font><br>
    <br>
    And he was gone<span lang="en-us">.</span> I did not have time to wait there before the server went<span lang="en-us">
    </span>down for restart.</p>

    <br>
    </b><font color="#FFFF99">I've gotten quite a few letters asking what Hollow 
    Armor is. They see people selling it in the Hub (Subway). What is it, they 
    ask me. How do you do the quest? How do I get a Hollow Suit? But every last 
    one of the letters I got checked the &quot;do not publish&quot; button! Doh! </font></span></p>
    <p>
    <span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">Don't be embarrassed, letter 
    writers! Turns out lots of people had the same question!</font></span></p>
    <p><span lang="en-us"><font color="#FFFF99">There is no Hollow Armor quest. 
    Hollow Armor is armor that is worn to fight Hollow Minions. If you hear 
    someone say, &quot;wear your hollow armor on the quest,&quot; it's a signal to mages 
    *not* to wear a buffed robe (hollow attacks ignore armor protects)! It can 
    be any armor at all, but usually it refers to a very high base AL. There you 
    go. End of 
    mystery. Now where can I get my curtains? ;-)</font><br>
