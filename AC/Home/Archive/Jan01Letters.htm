      They were most likely Elaborate Scrolls, which can be found on the floor
      of the room which contains the Major Shivering Stone in the Serac Vault.
      It can be translated in Cragstone for the Imperial Missive. You can read
      the details in my quest write-up. Frore translations also use the same

      Dear Mrs. Jackcat,<br>
      First off, I just want to say that your website is by far the best AC
      website out there. Even Microsoft's official AC site can't hold a candle
      to yours. I was wondering if you would accept me as your vassal? It would
      be the greatest honor in the world to call a beautiful woman like you my
      patron. I know that I am a level 1 weakling, but I promise that if you
      will accept me as your vassal, I would be the best that you have. Again,
      thank you for listening and keep up the good work on the best AC site in
      the world!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

      Thank you so much for the all the compliments. I am basking! And thank you
      for your generous offer to be my vassal. As I've had to tell other people,
      I am not accepting any more vassals in the foreseeable future. My one very
      special vassal, Ned Cleversun, who is 20-21 levels above me depending on
      the day, keeps me extra busy! I just don't really have the time, or play
      enough, to be a good Patron to anyone else. I do know, however, that there
      are many wonderful monarchies on all the worlds. I am certain any one of
      them would be proud to accept you as one of their own. Good luck, and

      in certain trophies to Collectors. That's why I asked you to save all

      for Shadow Hunter Armor</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Hi Maggie --&nbsp;<br>
      My question this month is short and simple. You recently published details
      of the quest for the major sparking stone, and said it could be used in
      shadow armor. The <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">Shadow Hunter Armor
      page</a> just lists &quot;Atlan Stones.&quot; In other areas of the site
      it refers to &quot;minor stones.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      You see my question coming, eh? Can you put major stones in shadow armor?
      Or minor stones? Or am I not understanding something?<br>
      <br>
      If you CAN put either minor or major stones, then which ones are you using
      on the shadow hunter armor page? And if those are minor, what would the
      stats be for shadow hunter armor with major stones?<br>
      <br>
      P.S. Please get me some Greater celdon shadow hunter armor, with whatever
      stones (minor, major, or some other kind) are the best. I'd like the fire
      and lightning protections, and maybe frost, also. Better include one of
      those tool things, ok? Thanks!</font>

    <p>Saw on your site that someone was inquiring to dye plant locations. I
    can't say for the other two new plants, but have found 3 light blue plants
    on the beaches near Mayoi. They seem to appear in the area where the sand
    meets the grass and blend in quite nicely, so it takes a good eye to pick
    them out. I regret to say their spawn points seem to be random along the
    coast, so it wasn't possible to give exact coordinates. Keep up the good
    work!</p>

    I mailed you before stating the light blue plant is to be found on the

    beaches far north of Eastham and on the beach/tropical area south of Yaraq.
    Still no specific coordinates as the buggers don't seem to spawn regularly
    in the same spot. It seems the light blue plant.. lapyan?.. forget the exact

    out, and it is quite a run from the Bandit Castle.&nbsp; I'm going to have
    to check AC Explorer (can't load on my computer at work) to see if there is
    a shorter way to do it.&nbsp; Basically you have to go to the Bandit Castle
    - 2 hops from Arwic - and run your butt off to the West.&nbsp; The Bandit
    Castle is at 66.4N 50.0E and Neydisa (sp? I've seen 5 different spellings)
    Castle is at 69.5N 17.6E and you take it to a guy named Yo Jin (???
