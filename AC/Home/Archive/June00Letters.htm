    <small><font face="Arial">Greetings Maggie,<br>
    For a while now, I have been fascinated with the Lost City of Frore. I would love to
    embark on such a quest yet I am afraid that my jump skill may not be high enough to enter
    the city and complete the quest. Could you please give me any estimations you have as to
    what a minimum jump skill should be and how much damage it will inflict?<br>
    <br>
    Thank You<br>

    <font color="#FFFF80">Hi Ezar -</font></font></small><p><small><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial">From what I've heard from different people, you&nbsp;will be fine with a jump
    of 135 or so, as long as the jump is controlled and you don't bump into the walls on the
    way down. Estimated damage about 50-60. A higher jump skill is better, of course!
    Recommended is a skill of 150+. If you buff yourself with bludgeon protection before
    taking the plunge, you will greatly reduce your chances of taking serious damage. Good
    luck!</font></small></p>

    <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">June 30, 2000 - Good Site, but.....</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">I wanted to say you have a nice site here, nice and colorful
    and good-looking. But I have to say I absolutely hate the weapons and armor section where
    you show all the armor and weapons. There are so many different variations and kinds of
    weapons and armors. You could take the time to list them all. Most of them are randomly
    generated in chests and they can't be bought. That makes it extremely hard to list all,
    and that's not even talking about the different spells on them. My idea would be to get
    rid of all the armor like that and only include regular armor, like plain plate and chain.
    Also include quest armor like Shadow Armor. The same goes for weapons too. Anyways, hope
    to see you in game some day. <br>
    <br>
    Happy hunting and godspeed to you.<br>

    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>Hi Velgar -<br>
    Thanks for the compliments on the site. And thanks for the criticism as well. I'm always
    looking for ways to improve the site. However, I don't plan to change the sections. :)
    They aren't really designed to give a comprehensive accounting of all the weapons and
    armor in the game. They were designed to give a general overview of the great variety and
    styles of clothing and armor and weapons available. When the new armor came out, it was
    absolutely forever before I got to see what a piece of Koujia looked like, and I knew
    others were in the same position I was. I wanted to show some samples of the randomly
    generated loot and the higher level stuff.</small></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>I had actually planned to go through and
    color code the standard items that are always available, but just haven't gotten around to
    it yet. I'll put it on the list!&nbsp; </small></font></p>

    Nice to hear from you again. I do know where you get the Faran Item Master Robe. I have

    <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">June 27, 2000 - We Love Maggie!</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Greetings My dear lady,<br>
    <br>
    I am just dropping a note to congratulate you on your great site in which I take pleasure
    to come back often to read news and to search for quests and items. I also enjoy your
    Letter and Runway section (Where I would like to see myself one day:).<br>
    <br>
    Also, if I can allow myself to recommend an addition to this wonderful site: it would be
    about adding a message board. Sure I agree that there are tons of forums already, but
    having one on your site where Maggie's fans could exchange pieces of information or just
    talk together would be great. I notice that your fans are usually mature people, so this
    board would be &quot;Flames Free!&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Finally, I would simply add that Maggie seems like a so nice lady and that I would be
    pleased to meet her one day (by the way, on which server do you play? Is it Dereth
    greatest secret, since I haven't found that piece of information around the site? Is it a
    negative point to celebrity, hiding so you can get a private gaming time? :)&nbsp; Also,
    if you do play on Leafcull, or happen to be there at some time, send me a message. I would
    be pleased to bring you to our home village called the Plateau. We have a small community
    there who fight to keep this outpost village from the dangers Dereth has to offer.<br>
    <br>
    Keep it up Maggie; we're behind you. At least I am. Well unless you face that ugly Othloi
    warrior, then I'm gone :)<br>

    <br>
    </small><br>
    <font color="#FFFF80"><small>Hi Exar Khum -</small><br>
    <small>Thank you so much for the nice letter. You're right; I have the nicest fans! &nbsp;
    Mature, articulate, thoughtful, adoring :). I've actually had several people ask about a
    message board for the site. I was considering it, and still am, but am hesitant for a
    variety of reasons. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>First, no message board will ever be &quot;Flames Free.&quot; I've been around the
    Internet long enough to know that the trolls are waiting, seeking the moment they can
    ripple the calm waters of Maggie's little oasis. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Second, I just don't have time to monitor the boards. There will be flames, there
    will be abusivie posts, they will have to be deleted.&nbsp; A dear friend of mine says the
    only way to effectively manage a board is to be as an Old Testament God, strinking at
    random, with no explanation, hearing no petitions, just making the decision to smite
    periodically and rid the land of evil. I don't really need the headache and can't
    currently fit god duties into my schedule.</small></font></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>Third, one of the things about my site I'd
    like to keep is its cohesiveness, its particular stance and what some have called
    &quot;The Maggie Spin.&quot; While just briefly perusing some of the other boards this
    morning, I got a little annoyed. Tragic posts of people leaving the game forever because
    it's just no fun anymore since the Direlands got nerfed (without ever stopping for a
    second to remember that Turbine has *always* corrected serious problems in their
    subsequent patches and that just *maybe* he should put things on hold until next month to
    see what happens). Vague claims of &quot;Something's wrong with the game.&quot; Pissy
    little flame wars. Name calling and personal attacks. Why, even chipper Allen Grey of CoD
    (my favorite boards) was bemoaning the fate of humanity. It can drag you down!</small></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>Maggie's terrain has no room for whiners and
    complainers. (Unless it's *me* whining and complaining! And I occasionally allow my vassal
    the same courtesy.) In the realm of the Jackcat all Drudges are pesky, all ph4+ 133+ is a
    Runway feature waiting to happen, every patch day is Cristmas! And Turbine can do no
    wrong.</small></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>Thanks again for your letter and the
    invitation to visit at the Plateau. If I'm ever on Leafcull, I'll be sure to say hello!</small></font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>[ June 22, 2000 Ned Cleversun, my dearest
    friend as well as harshest critic, wrote me that he didn't at all like the response I gave
    to Koveras. He thought I sounded snotty and dismissive! (<em>i.e.</em> thanks for the
    offer, Koveras, but I've already got a *better* picture from some *other* player, nyah,
    nyah, nyah.) Ouch! After rereading the response, I can see what he means, so Maggie the
    Jackcat would like to apologize to Koveras. Certainly no rudeness was intended. And I
    certainly don't mean to discourage people from sending cool screenshot! :) ]</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Hi, the name's Koveras, I play AC on Thistledown. </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>I'd just have to&nbsp; say your website is a great source of information, and that
    thanks to&nbsp; you (as of yesterday) I am now a proud owner of Hamud's Pyreal Katar.
    &nbsp; In case you're interested, I thought I'd send you a little addendum&nbsp; that's
    happened to that quest since Gertarh died:<br>
    <br>
    Upon giving the Ancient Dagger to Hamud, he not only gives you his&nbsp; Katar but also a
    2-page document entitled &quot;Hamud's Last Testament&quot;.&nbsp; It explains how he is
    trapped into service of a dark cult which he can't escape (I suppose that's why he's a
    shadow now), and in it he&nbsp; begs his daughter, Devana, to escape Dereth while she
    still can. If&nbsp; you give Devana (back at Zaikhal) his testament, she will reward you
    &nbsp; with Oswald's Dagger (<em>4-8 electric, speed 10, Deception Mastery V&nbsp; and
    Gertarh's Curse (lowers your Loyalty by 30)</em>).<br>
    <br>
    I can send you a screenshot of the dagger if you like, as soon as the&nbsp; servers come
    back up (although I've heard rumors something will&nbsp; happen to Hamud this patch...
    unfounded rumours though, most likely),&nbsp; if you don't have one already.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks again, great website!<br>

    Thank you so much for the info. I appreciate you sending me an update on the quest. I
    actually have a pic of Oswald's Dagger already, so no need to send it.&nbsp; I did put the
    full quest up on CoD (Crossroads of Dereth) a week or so ago, but hadn't updated my
    Jackcat site with the new addition of the Dagger.&nbsp; I've finally gotten it up in the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests.htm">Quest Section</a> and have included some fabulous

    <p><small><font face="Arial">During one of the developer chats, the good people from
    Turbine said that there is no level higher than 126. Sometimes, for a moment, it may
    appear that a creature is higher than level 126, but that this is just the servers
    &quot;hiccuping&quot; (that is the term that was used I believe) for a second, causing the
    level to APPEAR to be higher.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    At <a href="http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewstranscript3.asp" target="_blank">http://www.zone.com/asheronscall/news/ashenewstranscript3.asp</a>
    &nbsp;CFoster@turbine notes that level 126 is the highest a player can reach, I assume
    this is also so for monsters.<br>
    <br>
    Alas, I cannot find the spot where it is said that level 126 is highest for monsters, but

    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>I know exactly what you're referring to, but
    in fact, it doesn't apply to monsters.&nbsp;The 126 level limit is based on the
    theoretical experience curve. Due to the mathematics of the play time involved, it would
    be impossible for a player to earn enough to get from level 126 to 127 (although I bet
    there's a few out there happy to die trying!). That's why Turbine says that Level 126 is
    the highest level a player can reach. However, with the creatures, Turbine can just plug
    in any old numbers they want! The elusive White Rabbit is an impressive level 503!!! I
    believe Punumbris and Umbris are also over level 126. Hope that clears it up for you.</small></font></p>

    <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">June 11, 2000 - Cooking Lugian Sinews</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">This is the data that I have compiled while cooking
    sinews.&nbsp; This information is from trying out different skill levels and sizes. It is
    not from chats in game, rumors or other message boards so you should be able to trust it.<br>
    <br>
    When I had a cooking skill below 250 I cooked up 7 small sinews and 2 large sinews. &nbsp;
    I was able to expertly cook 4 of the small ones and 1 of the larges.&nbsp; This was about
    a 50% chance of success.<br>
    <br>
    When my skill was over 250, I was able to expertly cook ALL of 5 small sinews and 2 large
    sinews giving 100% success or at least very close to it.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    From the expertly cooked small sinew I obtained &quot;cured lugian sinew.&quot;&nbsp; The
    small ones that failed returned &quot;cured small lugian sinew.&quot;&nbsp; The expertly
    cooked large sinew returned &quot;cured large lugian sinew&quot; and the one that failed
    returned &quot;cured lugian sinew.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Therefore, I believe that there are 3 cooked products that one can receive from cooking
    the two sizes of sinews from lowest quality to highest: Cured small lugian sinew, Cured
    lugian sinew and Cured large lugian sinew.&nbsp; A failed large sinew is equal to an
    expertly cooked small sinew.<br>
    <br>
    I hope this helps out a little in this long quest. <br>

    <p><small><font face="Arial">Having followed your heartfelt exchange with your most loyal
    vassal, I have, as you know, arranged for a quick side trip to the Cragstone Goodwill
    store for him. He now vaguely resembles a war refugee, as all Goodwill shoppers tend to
    do, but he is one of the better-armoured war refugees on the server by my count.<br>
    <br>
    I do hope that this will alleviate Ned's fears about facing all those nasty monsters with
    the pointy claws and the bad... read acidic... breath, thus enabling him to earn those
    huge piles of lovely xp that you as his patron so wish for him to be earning.... for his
    own achievement only of course, not like we patrons are greedy or anything.<br>
    <br>
    He should now be &quot;set&quot;, and assuming that no especially nasty monster melts him
    or something, and assmuing he does not try high-diving off any especially high cliffs, I
    predict with confidence that you can now use the specter of my loyalty of 147, combined
    with your &lt;now&gt; outstanding ability to provide equipment to squeeze those few more
    precious points of loyalty out of the lad.<br>
    <br>
    By the way, a loyalty of 147.. in a monarch.. I don't know about you, but it almost makes
    me want to cry or something... just me?<br>

    <small>Thanks for the compliments on the site! Funny your should mention the <a href="../../Shopping/4Table.htm">Dinner Ware</a>! It's the one section I thought was safe
    from Turbine's monthly tweaking. But if those cheeky <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Rumors.htm">Town Criers</a> are to be believed, the burden
    stats have changed! I am going to have to change my site's desription! </small><br>
    <br>
    <em><small>&quot;The name says it all! Everything from quest information to the stats on
    an opal dinner plate!&quot;</small></em></font></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF80" face="Arial"><small>One thing I can definitely say about this
    game: I'll never run out of new content for the site! (Of course, I can't keep up with all
    the new content, either. But that's another issue altogether! :)</small></font></p>

    Layla refers to was a hilarious screen shot from the end of Beta which I claimed depicted
    me and my vassal getting frisky as we took advantage of our last minutes alive. The pic
    was pulled to make the site &quot;appropriate for a general audience&quot; in order get a
    listing on the Zone.]</small></font></p>

    Why, yes! I will be adding info on the <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/SoCS.htm">SoCS</a>!
    Thanks for the offer, but no need for now. Unless you want to get clarification on the
    pressure plates for the BD VI Ruby. I've gotten mail from someone who got stumped at that
    point and I'm afraid I was unable to help. :)</font></font></p>

    No, I don't have a monarch. I myself am the Monarch of a very small, very demanding
    Kingdom. As a relatively weak leader in comparison to surrounding realms, I've had to
    develop strategic alliances in order to keep my subject's limitless need for mana stones
    supplied. </font></p>
