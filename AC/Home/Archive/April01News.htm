      </b>Continuing with my desire to flesh out the <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts.htm">Arts
      &amp; Crafts</a> section, I've added a guide to <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Dyes.htm">Dyeing</a>.
      Special thanks to Rim the Dragonfly and to Danier for their help with this
      section, and to Auralyn for sharing her remarkable collection of dyed
      dresses. In addition to the <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/Dyes.htm">Dyes
      page</a>, you'll also find information on <a href="../../Shopping/Crafts/PlantLocations.htm">Plant
      Locations</a>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>April
      27, 2001<br>
      </b>I've updated the <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Stone2.htm">A Reign Of
      Stone</a> page with a few more little items: the Obsidian Shard, Orb of
      Clarity and the Lugian Crest. Thanks to Malacon Wolfsun for sending the
      pic along to me. I also corrected a few typos in some of the stats.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../../Odds&apos;nEnds/@command.htm">@commands</a>
      was updated with the @consent commands which allow others to loot your
      corpse!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../../Shopping/Bargains/Rates.htm">Vendor
      Rates</a> updated with the new Lugian Vendors in Linvak Tukal. I ran out
      of time to post some of my screenies from the city, but I hope to get them
      up in the next day or so. That is one cool place!! The stained glass walls
      are see through!<br>
      <br>
      <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> section updated with info on Level VII
      spells, the new arrows and more. I really get some great letters! I've
      come to accept that I will never ever catch up on my mail. I hope you all
      forgive me. :)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks to everyone for sending

      make sure to toss your names up here too. Sorry!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">And last, Erde of Harvestgain
      sent me pics and stats of the Lesser Shadow Amuli! That, along with
      Ravlen's pics of the Lesser Koujia, finally complete the <a href="../../Apparel/GemArmor.htm">full
      array of Shadow Armor</a>. Thanks very much Erde and Ravlen! You look

      25, 2001<br>

      the game when I can squeeze it in. I think this has got to be the Best
      Patch Ever!!</font>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>April
      19, 2001<br>
      </b>Big update on the A <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Stone2.htm">Reign of
      Stone patch page</a>. Lots of pics and stats for the new Lugian items,
      plus new lore, the Dread Mattekar Claw and more. Page contains spoilers,
      so consider this the warning! I'll be transferring the info on the Lugian
      items into the quest section as soon as I verify a few more details.<br>
      <br>
      Also included is the new URL for ACTrack and the udpated calibration
      number from the program author himself.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>April
      18, 2001<br>

      from the patch up on my <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/Stone2.htm">A Reign of
      Stone patch page</a>, but it's a start.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Lugians galore; cool new armor, weapons and crafted items; casinos; new
      dungeons (view a nice map of the Linvak Tukal by Doogen <a href="../../Culture/Dereth/LinvakTukal.htm">here</a>;
      a new pack monster; and my favorite -- thrown weapon love!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

      people something to read while the game is being updated.&nbsp;</font></p>

      15, 2001<br>
      </b>Yay! Finally, a day off, taxes are done before midnight for once, and
      I got a chance to dig through the Inbox a little.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <a href="../Letters.htm">Letters</a> updated with a few short questions and
      answers. Also, if you still don't have any clue what &quot;All your base
      are belong to us&quot; means, there's a link inside to a very enlightening
      FAQ.<br>
      <br>
      I also just wanted to say a little howdy to the folks I met in person
      yesterday at Allen Grey's impromptu farewell party. For those of you who
      don't know Allen, he's been the Site Manager for <a href="http://ac.xrgaming.net" target="_blank">Crossroads
      of Dereth</a> for the last 2 years and is responsible for making it one of
      (if not *the* ) premier AC sites on the web. Allen recently decided to
      step down from the post for a variety of reasons and folks in the area
      were given an open invite to come out to say &quot;thank you&quot; in
      person. It was a blast! Food and fun and hours and hours of hilarious talk
      about AC. It was a real pleasure meeting a few more of the folks behind
      the pixels. Thanks to Wee Mad Arthur for setting it up. And no guys, I do <i>not</i>
      need a Patron. ;-)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks also to Tom K. for updated stats on
      <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/Singularity.htm"> Singularity Spear</a>, to Celestian for correcting a small error on the

      Sorry for the lack of updates the last few days. Work has been killing me.
      Then over the weekend I had to deal with a few computer issues resulting
