    <p><b>November 15, 2001 -&nbsp; Simply A Question</b>
    </p>
    <p>Hello, I'll start this off by sucking up and saying how your site is my favorite out there, considering it tells the easiest way to get from one place to another.  Also,
    I just have a lot of fun looking at the Runway.  Anyway, I was curious, what level are you?  Considering all the friends that have such great stuff, I would think a high level, but
    I'm not quite sure.  Well, that's it for now, but I may be e-mailing you about the
    Runway at one point.&nbsp;<br>

    Everyone knows that I adore letters that start with a nice suck up remark,
    so thank you! I am, as of last night, level 50! Yay!! Only 20 more levels
    until I can get Life Magic!! ;-) I finally got to change my front page back
    to a 23 level difference from the previous 24 levels (my wonderful vassal,
    Ned Cleversun, is level 73). I'm glad you like the Runway. It continues to
    be a very popular section even though I can't seem to get my act together to
    get it updated more often. Um... more coming soon! ;-) Thanks again.</font>

    <p><b>November 15, 2001 -&nbsp;Item Magic and Dark Majesty Collars</b></p>
    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    First of all, I love your site! In my opinion, it's the most organized and easy
    to use site out there for AC quests.<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, I just acquired the collars on the Dark Majesty island and after trying each one on I noticed that my item magic skill was reduced to 0 for
    each of the collars. There is no message stating the negative effect when you put them on. I happened to scroll through my skills and noticed that my item magic skill which is trained and close to 200 base was reduced to 0 for each of the four collars.<br>
    <br>
    I had a feeling they were too good to be true (heck, they still are!).<br>
    <br>
    Keep up the great work!!<br>

    <p>Hey Maggie the Jackcat,&nbsp;<br>
    I was wondering if the Green Mire Yoroi was any good. I read the little bio of it (great job).
    I also wanted to know the coordinantes of the yoroi, and any details of the armor or dungeon would
    be helpful. Keep up the good work!</p>

    <p> P.S. How do I make an item a no drop/no give??<br>
    </p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">Hi Beo-Wulf -<br>
    Yes, the Green Mire Yoroi Cuirass is great for low level characters, like
    yourself. It's almost like a rite of passage in AC! People used to STAND IN
    LINE to get their chartreuse bundle of fashion joy. You must have read <a href="../../Apparel/Runway/Minerva.htm">Minerva
    of Moom's tale</a> on the Runway. For information on the quest itself,
    you'll have to look in the Hobbies Section. You can find details <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/GMGrave.htm">here</a>.
    (It's slightly inaccurate, but I've never gotten around to updating that
    page. It should have enough information to get you what you need
    though.)&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FFFF99">As to your second question, you can't make items no
    drop/no give. They either are that way, or they're not. For example, Mi Krau-Li's
    Improved Jitte and the Mace of the Explorer are no give. Which means I've
    been lugging them around in my backpack along with my Minor Atlan Stones,
    Tumerok Banners, Mosswart Shroud, Gwillim's Alchemy Bag, Grievver Acid, etc.
    etc. and so on and so forth. It's a good think I'm a Melee Fighter and very
    strong!! Other items, like the Green Mire Cuirass, can be given away, so
    when you outgrow your armor, you don't have to keep carrying it around with
    you forever, but can stow it safely away in your storage chest, or on a
    mule. Good luck!</font></p>

    <p>My question may strike discord among thousands of readers who ready their torches to burn me! "Of course it's worth it, you heathen! Burn!" I hear from people. But now that I think about it, and the time I spend on AC isn't as much *ahem* as some other people. A weekend warrior am I, with AC thrown

    <p>Hi Maggie,<br>
    I do enjoy your Asheron's Call website. Normally, I would get information *from* your page but this time I have something to
    contribute!<br>
    <br>
    I read the brief write-up of the Olthoi Soldier pincer quest on your Dark Magesty page. According to the write up, you have to run
    across an acid pit to reach the soldier with the pincer. While that is technically true, I found
    that if you stand near the edge of the pit (avoiding the unpleasant corrosive
    goo) the Olthoi on the far side will wander over to attack you, including the&nbsp;
    one with the pincer. I have seen this done twice so I know that it is&nbsp; repeatable.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks!<br>

    <p><b>November 15, 2001 -&nbsp;</b><b>In Search of the Queen</b></p>
    <p>Hi Maggie,&nbsp;<br>
 I LOVE your site. It has more information on the quests than anywhere else.  I come here whenever I need to know something my
    Patron does not know the answer to (needless to say, I am here quite often :) lol, just kidding).<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, my allegiance recently attempted to kill the Olthoi queen on Leafcull.  We got through almost the entire quest using your guide.  We ran into a problem at the end of the quest, when one person needs to stay behind to hit the switches.  Our allegiance did not complete the quest, because we could not find the switches.  We realized later (hindsight is 20/20) the switches were actually touchpads (the Frore quest has something similar, I am told).  They are activated simply by stepping on them, and making a clicking sound, but there is no physical object to select.  The reason I am telling you this is I hoped maybe you could post that additional information to prevent any further problems for other questers.<br>
    <br>
    Thanks a lot,<br>
    <br>
    Quin Cha,&nbsp;<br>
 Brell Clan, Leafcull</p>
    <p><br>
    <font color="#FFFF99">Hi Quin Cha -<br>
    You must have a great Patron to let you get away with such blatant teasing.
    Why, <a href="../../Hobbies/Quests/PKAdventure.htm">I'd
    PK my vassal</a> if he talked about me like that! ;-)<br>

    Thanks for the extra info on the Queen quest. Like all the Dark Majesty
    quest pages, they are only partially complete! I should have a warning
    posted: use at your own risk! :-) I usually try to confirm everything
    personally before doing a full write-up. In this case, however, that will be
    impossible, since I'm nowhere near Level 70! I must rely on others like you
    to fill in the gaps. I'm sorry you were unable to complete your run, but I
    hope your information will help other groups attempting this quest. I'll try
    to get the page updated soon. Thanks again, and thanks for the compliments
    on the site!</font></p>
