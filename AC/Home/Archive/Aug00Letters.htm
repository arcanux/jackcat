      numbers, unadjusted for your leadership and his loyalty. If both scores
      were above 100 for the duration of the vassalage, then the numbers displayed
      would be low. Since we both know that those scores are well below 100... well... it explains the
      discrepency. Regardless, there DOES seem to be a
      bug in that the xp listed is not what was earned for the patron in question,
      but appears to be the xp given to patrons in general over the life of a character. Just thought you would like to know.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Thanks for trying to clear
      up the mystery. I must admit that even with your explanation, I still
      don't quite understand how the experience works between Vassals and
      Patrons. Ned Cleversun and I have, of course, an unusual situation, as he
      is now 18 levels above me. My Leadership stat is still very low, but he
      has, thanks to your merciless goading (in a completely loving way, of
      course :) and his high regard for his Patron, continued to beef up his
      Loyalty whenever possible. I believe right now he is concentrating on
      increasing his bow stat, to give himself a vitae cushion for his composite
      bow, so Loyalty has hovered around 125 for quite some time now. I'd love
      for someone to lay out a really detailed explanation of how experience
      gets distributed in an allegiance. If you run across one, let me know!</font></p>

      From what I understand, the Turbinites have mention in the past that they

      A while back I had asked you if there was a place in the Direlands where I could buy the
      Lifestone Recall Scroll.&nbsp; Well, I happened to be in the place called Weijong (sp) with my new mage.
      I could do no damage with him and had run to the upper most part of the shop for safety from the shadow Lt. that
      had come in to get me.&nbsp; I found a merchant that sold magical Items and while browsing his wares I came across
      the Portal Recall Scroll!&nbsp; I can't remember how much it cost, but
      there were only two available.&nbsp; I quickly bought them up for my vassals, since I had learned the spell
      already.&nbsp; I came back a few days later and there were two there again.&nbsp; Maybe this info can help someone if you haven't already
      discovered this yourself!</font></p>

      fast before everyone else, simply wait for the wisp to spawn,
      and rush the chest with your picks ready. But you better hurry 'cause that

      You're right! That would ruin all the fun! :) Although I must admit that I
      used lock pick to get to the lower level of the West Wing the first time I
      went to the Grave. As I was heading down, someone already had the door
      opened, so I just went in, not using my key. Then I died! No problem, I
      thought. I've still got my handy-dandy key! But when I got back to the

      Great job on the site!&nbsp; Quick question.&nbsp; I'm going on the
      Ravenous weapon quest with a group of people and I noticed on your site
      that there's no weapons skill check with the Hollow weapon.&nbsp; I've
      seen on other sites that there is a check.&nbsp; Is there a check with the
      Ravenous weapon?&nbsp; I'm currently 29th level and although I won't be
      able to use the weapon now, I'd like to get it to use it in a few levels
      from now.&nbsp; But I don't want to get it if I can fail a skill check (my
      unbuffed UA skill is 196) and not be able to get another one.&nbsp; Thanks
      for your time.<br>

      The only skill check required is that you have to have the skill trained
      for your specific weapon. There was a bug previously where Axe users were
      able to make Ravenous Daggers while Dagger users were not, but it has
      since been fixed. Good luck! And thanks for the nice words about the site!</font></font></p>

      Quests</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a great many quests that are not
      listed on your site.... The ones that are listed, are, for lack of a better word...Uber-helpful :)<br>
      <br>
      If at all possible, I would like to see more quests in the quest section, the Neydisa Hauberk, being
      one. After seeing the elemental protections on it I think it would make great beginner armor (now that
      mattekar hide coats are harder to get).<br>
      <br>
      I also would like to point out that I would not have been able to complete Frore, and a couple of other
      quests in the game without your site.<br>

      Thanks for writing. Glad you found the quest guides helpful! I do plan to
      continue putting more quests up in the section. It's really a time
      constraint issue. With my very busy job, life, the CoD quest section I
      also maintain, plus trying to squeeze in time to actually PLAY the game,
      it's not as easy as you'd think to continue to add content regularly. I'll
      certainly put the Neydisa Hauberk quest on the list! :)</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hey Sis,<br>
      I was playing in AC for less than five minutes, and before I could even get out of that beginning area, I had two different people try to get me
      to join their allegiance!&nbsp; How rude is it to just ignore these guys? I
      could barely move without someone talking to me! I have enough trouble just
      moving around without having to answer everyone.&nbsp; They both said, &quot;The
      first thing you need to do is get a patron! Come with me and I'll help you out.&quot;
      Needless to say, I told them I wanted to try on my own first. Maybe I DO
      need a patron Hint Hint Hint!! Just wanted a few etiquette pointers.<br>
      <br>

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Hey!<br>
      Glad you're finally in the game! You will like it! Send me mail and let me
      know when you're on and I'll meet up with you so you can swear to me
      temporarily. It will keep you from being bombarded by the &quot;Allegiance
      Pimps&quot; who hang out trying to recruit the newbies before they know
      any better. Down the road, if you find an allegiance you'd like to join,
      I'll release you and you won't have a penalty to reswear. It will save you
      a lot of hassles, believe me! Ignoring them is fine, or politely blowing
      them off. Tell then you already have a Patron. You can also squelch them!!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">Most people in the game are
      polite and helpful and nice and deserve the same courtesy; however, there
      are some behaviors that deserve no mercy. :) I *still* get the &quot;U
      need a Patron?&quot; when I go to town! I'm afraid I can't resist mocking
      them, asking why in the world I, a Level 27 player, would swear to some
      doofus whom I have never met. They are insane.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">&nbsp;I'll also help you
      out with some beginners pointers. I will show you all!<br>
