    -----------------------------------------------<br>
    THE NEXUS!<br>
    -----------------------------------------------<br>
    If you've been paying attention, you will have noticed that the Shadows are on the attack!
    &nbsp; Turbine's Thorns of the Hopeslayer event is in full swing. First Ferah stormed the
    land, wreaking havoc and destruction. Then Ler Rhan joined the fray. And finally, the
    Shadow Keys, which many had falsely claimed to possess, became a reality in-game. Brave
    groups of heroes pooled their resources to gather the pieces, scattered in the various
    spires throughout Dereth. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Each key is composed of three pieces, and the
    gateways to the spires are level restricted. Players as low as level 6 could possibly find
    themselves completing&nbsp;a critical part in the ongoing battle against the dark ones.
    Once the keys were assembled, these brave warriors traveled to the Nexus in the dead of
    night to battle the mighty Nexus Crystal.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>As the Nexus Crystal was destroyed, it dropped 2
    Scintillating Gems and a Nexus Core Crystal. Tron is the possessor of the totally kick-ass
    Nexus Shadow Armor made from this Nexus Core Crystal on the Thistledown server. Although
    Tron did not&nbsp; make the killing blow, his comrades recognized his fearless leadership
    and ensured that this most special prize was rightfully bestowed. Alas, on other worlds,
    the outcome was less desirable as the evil of the Shadows permeated the land and hardened
    the hearts of its inhabitants. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The destruction of the Nexus Crystal also
    succeeded in ridding the land of the threat of the Umbris Shadows. (Drat! No more ph4t
    L3wt!)</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>-----------------------------------------------<br>
    TIDBITS<br>
    -----------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small>Ayudame on Leafcull noticed that I didn't mention cow tipping on my site. For those
    of you who don't know about this tidbit, walk up to a cow and double click on it in peace
    mode. Better check over your shoulder first. Never know if one of those ACDEL
    people&nbsp;could be lurking nearby!</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>-----------------------------------------------<br>
    AC SITES IN THE NEWS<br>
    -----------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small>Speaking of cows... Dr. Twister is in the news for using my Dereth cow picture on
    its site as the Shot of the Week. As glad as I am that they admired my handiwork, I do ask
    that people get permission before lifting graphics off my site. And please attribute the
    source. (Since it's a mild infraction I won't hit them with the &quot;You
    Suck&quot;&nbsp;treatment I gave PC Punks. Anyway, they gave me a nice link in their links
    section, so I am happy to let it slide!)</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Asheron's Call Environmental Defense League<br>
    <a href="http://gregdan.com/acedl/acedl.html" target="_blank">http://gregdan.com/acedl/acedl.html</a><br>
    The ACDEL is&nbsp;also in the news. Not for their cow tipping aversion, but for making
    their swimsuit calendar for 14 P.Y. available to the public free of charge!&nbsp;The ACDEL
    is dedicated to preserving the natural resources, defending the native wildlife, and
    protecting the environment of the Worlds of Asheron's Call. Check it out!</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Asheron's Call Sage Central<br>
    <font size="2"><a href="http://www.acsage.com/" target="_blank">http://www.acsage.com/</a><br>
    AC Sage is up and running. This news and information site offers guild hosting, guides,
    forums and more! A lot of the content is still waiting to be filled in, but take a look at
    the designs for the different worlds! They look great! What sets this apart from other
    news sites is their server specific news, including reigning monarchs.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">-----------------------------------------------<br>
    </font>MAGGIE THE JACKCAT'S KICK-ASS FABULOUS AC SITE NEWS!</small><br>
    <small>-----------------------------------------------<br>
    Again, I'd like to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for my site. It helps keep it fun.
    I love the letters! I especially like the ones that say how wonderful I am. Can't get
    enough of them. Send more!! :-) Special thanks to Bob at the Zone for the link on their
    site, and thanks also to AC Trade Post &amp; Dr. Twister for links.<br>
    <br>
    <font size="2">I also want to take this opportunity to thank the volunteers for my new
    section: The Runway. If you haven't been by to take a look it, it features various
    players, modeling their favorite armor and equipment. Jaide, the&nbsp;Shopping
    Dominatrix&nbsp;of Leafcull, helped me get&nbsp;the section up and running, modeling a
    basic, yet stylish set of chainmail armor. If you look closely, you'll notice a red dot
    near her&nbsp;wrist. That's blood spurting from her arm as a Skeleton attacks
    her!&nbsp;And here you thought modeling was easy! Azeraphel&nbsp;Lorekeeper,&nbsp;of CoD
    fame, and Danier of Thistledown also graciously agreed to be featured. They have some
    really, really cool stuff! I liked being able to try their stuff on, even if it was just
    for a few seconds to snap the pics. I felt&nbsp;very buff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></small></p>
    <p><small>My latest victim is Minerva of Moom, who models a Green Mire Cuirass. In
    response to the great demand for MORE QUESTS (I'll get right on it!), I have published the
    Green Mire Grave quest as a companion piece.</small></p>
    <p><small>And as always, if you have shots of items you know I'm missing -- really cool
    armor &amp; weapons, screen shots of Quest items, or anything else you think I'd like,
    send them to <a href="mailto:pics@thejackcat.com">pics@thejackcat.com</a>. Non-compressed
    .jpg format is preferred.<small><font face="Arial" size="3"><br>

    <small>SPECIAL REQUEST</small><br>
    <small>-------------------------------------------------</small><br>
    <small><font face="Arial" size="3"><small>As the Thorns of the Hopeslayer event unfolds,
    various heroes have a chance for Fame! New broadcast messages tell of&nbsp;players' valor
    and victories. Veritus Venatus, from CoD, and I have been trying to compile an accurate
    list of Heroes from this past weekend, but need some help. We had a few discrepancies
    between us and there seemed to be some confusion, especially about the Morningthaw and
    Leafcull servers. If you'd please take a moment to review our lists for accuracy, I'd
    appreciate it. If you see any mistakes, please send me an email. Thanks!<br>
