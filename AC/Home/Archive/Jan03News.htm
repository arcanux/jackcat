<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet another section has been 
revamped: <a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Parchmnt.htm">
Rumors</a> in the <a href="../../Culture/culture.htm">
Culture</a> section. Instead of listing out the texts of the rumors back to back 
as before, 
I've moved each rumor to its own individual page and added the text of the examine 
panel, if any. The list is divided out into store bought rumors and other notes and 
rumors. A page with
<a href="../../Culture/Parchments/Townspeople.htm">
Townpeople Sayings</a> from various patches has also been added.</font></span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The
<a href="../../Travel/travel.htm">Travel</a> section 
boasts another exciting new feature, courtesy of Arboc and Passive Resistance of 
SC (apologies for the delay in getting it up on the site)! They've created a 
Dereth Navigation system which allows you to quickly and easily get the shortest 
route to any location via Arwic. Visit the the
<a href="../../Travel/shortcuts.htm">Shortcuts</a> page 
to see this feature in action! Thanks again Arboc and Passive Resistance!! It's 
pretty cool!</font></span></p>
