    <td valign="top" width="443"><font face="Arial" size="2">No, the site is not
      in danger of going under.</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There! I thought I'd get that out the way
      first, just to allay any fears that seeing these buttons may have
      caused.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Web sites, of course, are not free. There
      are hosting charges and bandwidth costs involved. Over time, Maggie the
      Jackcat's Kick-Ass Fabulous AC Web Site has grown from a few thousand
      visitors a month to up to <span lang="en-us">4</span>0,000 unique visitors a day! (Patch days, and
      the aftermath, of course!! On a normal day, 1<span lang="en-us">8</span>-<span lang="en-us">22</span>K is a more accurate
      number.)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the costs of running this site are
      substantially more expensive than when I first published my little
      spreadsheets for the edification of my vassal, they are still within the
      realm of the reasonable for me. The cost involved is off-set by the
      pleasure I get from enjoying my hobby. Rest assured, if that was ever to
      change, I would give fair warning before letting the site go down the
      toilet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So why the Tip Jar buttons?&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Because I like money! And because so many
      of you have written to me, asking if there was any way you could make a
      donation, as thanks for the resources I provide. I've always strived to
      comply with your reasonable requests about what content goes on the site!
      ;-)&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In the past I've always been thrilled by the D notes or special somethings
      people drop on Maggie in-game, or the funny little inscribed rings,
      crockery, fezes, notes on parchments, and so forth that I've been given.
      All your gifts and letters are tangible evidence that what I am doing is valued by the
      AC community, that people want and appreciate my efforts. When I gave it
      some thought, I realized that I was just as likely to be tickled by tokens
      of appreciation in the form of real live actual cash money! The extra good bonus
      of cash donations is that I can spend it! I can use it to BUY THINGS, in real
      life!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, for those of you who wish to give me
      real life money, please use the buttons to the right! For those of you who
      don't, please know that I love you just the same! I've never been fond of
      the guilt tactics you sometimes hear on Public Radio: If you listen to our
      station you should GIVE US MONEY! (Of course I do anyway, even though I
      don't like the tactics! ;-) I've always offered the site free of charge to
      *all* the visitors who come here, whether you've ever written or said
      hello or not!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And if, at the end of the day, I only have
      $1 in my Tip Jar? Well, that's one dollar more than I had yesterday. And
      that's good enough for me!</font></p>
