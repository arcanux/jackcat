      Taking screenshots</font></b></p>
      <p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">
      Taking screenshots is easy. There's already a key mapped to the function. It's your 
      <span lang="en-us">asterisk</span> key<span lang="en-us"> 
      (*)</span> on your numberpad. Each time you press it, a screenshot will automatically be saved on your hard drive in .bmp format. If you take a bunch of screenshots, they will automatically be numbered for you in order.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      To retrieve your screenshots, you need to open your Windows Explorer 
      <span lang="en-us">(or My Computer) </span>and find your Asheron's Call folder on your hard drive. That's the folder that was created when you installed the game. More than likely, it will be on your C: drive under Program Files\Microsoft Games<span lang="en-us">\Asheron's 
      Call</span>. If it's not there, you can use the Find function under Tools to search for it. When you've located the Asheron's Call folder, open it up and you should see your screenshots right there. They will be numbered like this: ACscrn<span lang="en-us">000</span>1.bmp, ACscrn<span lang="en-us">000</span>2.bmp, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Graphics saved in .bmp format are large files! If you take a lot of screen shots, they will start to eat up space on your hard drive. To make them more
      manageable, and to make them more suitable for posting on the web or emailing to your friends (or sending to 
      <span lang="en-us">me on patch day! ;-)</span> you should convert the files into .jpg format.<br>
      <br>
      To convert your pictures to .jpg, you'll need a graphics editing program. You can download any number of free ones from Download.com. A popular one is Irfan View. You can get it </font>
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF80">
      <a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10077-108-38759.html?tag=st.dl.10077.upd.10077-108-38759" target="_blank">here</a></font><font face="Arial" size="2">.<br>
      [Insert legal disclaimers here!!]<br>
      <br>
      Using Irfan View as an example, open up one of your screenshots in your editing program. To convert to a .jpg, choose "Save As" under the File menu. Make sure the the .jpg extension is selected, THEN (important part) click on your Options Tab to select quality. You'll see some sort of slider bar with 100% being best quality/large file size. The higher the quality, the larger the file size. Personally, I prefer better quality and slightly larger file size than lesser quality/smaller file size. In general, I wouldn't suggest going lower than 70% or higher than 95% when selecting quality, but it's a matter of preference.<span lang="en-us"> 
      (I prefer higher quality .jpgs)</span><br>
      <br>
      Click <span lang="en-us">Ok</span> and you're done! You have a nice .jpg file suitable for emailing or posting on the web!
      <span lang="en-us">I suggest creating another folder on your hard drive 
      (not your Asheron's Call folder) to save you converted .jpgs into. </span>Don't forget to delete the original .bmps from your hard drive to conserve
      space.<span lang="en-us"> Note: if you reinstall AC, all your screenshots 
      in your Asheron's Call folder will be deleted. </span><br>

      </span><br>
      </small></strong><span lang="en-us"><font size="2">Screenshots taken when 
      it's dark outside don't generally turn out well. If you are posing with 
      your new armor/weapon/thing-a-ma-bob, wait until it's daytime, then snap 
      your shot. Or go inside a building.</font></span></font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Use your camera views to 
      get the best angle. Try using first person view instead of third person 
      view or rotating your camera. Screenshots of the backs of your head are 
      only interesting if we can see what you're looking at too! ;-)</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Maggie the Jackcat loves 
      icons! Currently, there's a bug that sometimes makes the icon not appear 
      in your examine panel. Stats by themselves are good, but stats with the 
      icon is better. If the icon doesn't appear when you examine an item, hit 
      your &quot;e&quot; key twice to fix this. The icon should then appear in the examine 
      panel. Make the icon appear, *then* take the screenshot! </font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Please send the <b>
      entire examine panel</b> when sending icons, not just the pic of the icon 
      sitting in your backpack. In most instances, I'll want to verify the full 
      text of the description and the value and burden to post on the page.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">As stated above, I 
      prefer high quality .jpgs. However, if converting your .bmps really is 
      just beyond your skills, I would rather have your screenshots then not 
      have them. If you must send .bmps, please try not to send multiple .bmps 
      in one email. Zip them if possible, or send only 1 or 2 at a time, just in 
      case I happen to be at home on dial-up when I am downloading them.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I prefer un-cropped 
      screenshots so that I can edit or resize them to suit the page.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Always use
      <a href="mailto:jackcat@spacestar.net">jackcat@spacestar.net</a> to send 
      screenshots.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Please remember to post

      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I receive a LOT of 
      email. A lot. Due to the volume of mail I receive, I most likely will be 
      unable to send you a personal reply. I am extremely grateful for all the 
      help you give me, especially on&nbsp; patch days, and I read every single 
      one, but I just don't have the time to answer all that email *and* keep up 
      with the site. I do my best to publish as much information as I can, but I 
      constantly have a substantial back-log. </font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Following are a few tips 
      that may help you help me better manage the email I receive:</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have information 
      for the site, instead of sending email saying:</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I have the 
      stats/information/screenshot of such-and-such, do you want it? Please 
      email me back!!&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I prefer email that 
      says, &quot;Here are the stats/information/screens of such-and-such.&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">The second has a chance 
      of getting on the site. The first has almost no chance of getting 
      answered. (Did I mention I get a LOT of email? ;-)</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of sending email 
      that says, &quot;the Siruluun Headdress now has tinkering spells!&quot; </font>
      </span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Please send mail that 
      says, &quot;The new spells for the Siruluun Headdress are now </font></span>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">Armor Tinkering Expertise Self V , Weapon 
      Tinkering Expertise Self V, Magic Resistance Self V, Item Tinkering 
      Expertise Self V ,Monster Attunement Self V<span lang="en-us">,</span>Magic 
      Item TInkering Expertise Self V<span lang="en-us">,</span>
      <span lang="en-us">P</span>erson Attunement Self V<span lang="en-us">. All 
      the rest of the stats remain the same.&quot;</span></font></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Instead of sending mail 
      that says, &quot;The Undead stats are all outdated!!&quot; </font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Please send mail that 
      says, &quot;The new level for Zombies is 17. The rest of the Zombie stats are 
      still the same. Here's a screenshot for verification.&quot;</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are asking a 
      question about the game and check &quot;Do Not Publish,&quot; your question will 
      likely never be answered. Likewise, I am unable to send you personal 
      emails with quest walk-throughs that have not yet been published on my 
      site. When I have the quest walk-through written, it will be published in 
      the quest section!</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you ask questions 
      that have already been answered on the site, these will also not be 
      answered.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I am unable to send 
      shout-outs to your special in-game friends or monarchs. Likewise, I am 
      unable to publish messages to people you have lost track of and are trying 
      to get back in touch with. I suggest you post these sorts of requests on 
      the Vault or Warcry or Stratics boards.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If the 9MB .bmp of you 
      posing in your new armor didn't get published, please do not resend a 2nd 
      time, just in case I didn't get it.</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you sent fabulous 
      patch or quest or creature or some other information and it has not yet 
      been published, rest assured that it's &quot;on the list.&quot; If you send mail 
      asking if I received it and you *don't* get a reply, then you know I 
      received it. ;-) </font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, I know you all want 
      to be on the Runway!! Yes, I would like to get back to updating the 
      section. No, please do NOT tell me in-game to ask me about the Runway.
      </font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">I do apologize for the 
      sometimes long delays, but, well, I have this pesky time-consuming&nbsp; 
      job. Really, I promise, it's on the list! As I like to say: more coming 
      soon! ;-)</font></span></p>
      <p><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="2">Thank you for the 
      wonderful mail you do send. I appreciate it all! The Letters section 
      continues to be a favorite, even when I am slacker-chick and perpetually 
      behind in keeping it updated. I hope these suggestions give you a little 
      insight into the kinds of issues I deal with regarding your email to me 
      and help to assure you that I'm not ignoring you; I'm just a little busy. 
      Thanks again!</font></span></p>
