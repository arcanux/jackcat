        lot of Tuskers sacrificed their lives to make this event a success. As I 
        state on my home page, the site wouldn't even exist if it weren't for my 
        vassal, Ned Cleversun. From some of the strong feelings expressed to me 
        in your letters, I am more aware than ever of how much you enjoy Maggie 
        the Jackcat's Kick-Ass Fabulous AC Web Site. I'm so pleased that I was 
        able to give you all the opportunity to get to know the man who helped 
        make it all happen just a little bit better.</span></font><p>

        received from my regular visitors: the amused, the confused, the angry, 
        the indignant. As more came in each day, patterns began to emerge. I've 
        separated a sampling of them out into different types. I left out a 
        couple of categories: the begging, the crying, the pleading. And 
        actually, I was just a little bit disappointed that there weren't more 
        attempts at outright bribery! ;-) I couldn't possibly publish all the 
        letters I received, but truly, I enjoyed them all. Even the ones that 
        were so surly they could only have been written by (yes, you guessed it) 
        that dastardly &quot;Anonymous.&quot; And if I seem to be poking a little fun at 
        some of you by publishing a few of these, please remember: it doesn't 
        mean that I don't love you!</font></span></p>

    completely revamped your website to be an &quot;homage&quot; to your vassal.&nbsp; I had to 
    check it out for myself. (I hadn't played much lately thus I didn't have 
    much need to read the latest from The Jackcat) I have just been perusing the

    <p>Maggie, I know you want to dedicate the website to Ned but...IT'S NOW BORING 
    AS HELL! It's nice to hear about the adventures on you and Ned, but it's all 
    Ned, all the time now. It's like going to thecommercialchannel.com now. If 
    you want the website about Ned, then put a &quot;Ned&quot; section in, and don't go 
    and dump the whole damn website.<br>
