    Report From the Field</span></b></p>
    <p>Hi Maggie! Just a quick hello and an interim report on how things are 
    going. <br>
    <br>
    The responses to the web site that I've received in-game, from friends and 
    strangers alike, has been overwhelmingly positive! Everyone is excited about 
    me and wants to know more. <br>
    <br>
    Several people have realized that it won't be easy to play the game without 
    the fine information you provided, but they are determined to do the best 
    they can! <br>
    <br>
    As one warrior said, &quot;When Maggie's site was up we all benefited and now -- 
    we all face the same challenge, ignorant and confused together.&quot; It's kind 
    of sweet when you think of it that way.<br>
    <br>
    Amen. So, thanks again for the very nice tribute you created for me! I will 
    send new pics when I get a chance. I understand that the area above OP BSD 
    is pretty exciting. There are tuskers.</p>

    <p>I think that your website is cool, but now is kind of stupid. This was 
    the only place to go to find how to do quests. This used to be the best site 
    for AC fans, but Ned Cleversun's face doesn't do much for us lazy people. I 
    would like to see the website, the way it used to be...HELPFUL! Ned 
    Cleversun is pretty cool, and I like reading about him, but I still need 
    help with quests, portals, etc... Please change the site back. I still need 
    hints and tips on how to get to portals, and with the OP BSD, Ayan BSD, and 
    BSD portal map for Ned Cleversun, it doesn't even tell the coords to the 
    BSDs. Please add at least some of the old info.</p>

    Celebration Is In Order!</span></b></p>
    <p>I'm less than 5 mil away, so it won't be long. I think it would be 
    appropriate to do something special on the web page to mark this incredible 
    stage in all our lives. What I was thinking is that, for one day only, or 
    maybe two or three days, <span lang="en-us">or for some indeterminate 
    period, </span>a special LEVEL 80 page be created and (this is the 
    really good part) the LEVEL 80 page be renamed, TWICE, once to the name of 
    the main page and once to the name of the &quot;what's new&quot; page. Get it? So 
    everybody just GOES to the page about LEVEL 80. Then you could have a link 
    at the bottom of the LEVEL 80 page that went to the main and &quot;what's new&quot; 
    pages, which would have been renames, temporarily, to &quot;Ned is Level 80 
    alternative page 1&quot; and &quot;Ned is Level 80 alternative page 2&quot;!!! <br>
    <br>
    What d'you think? </p>

    overshadow my *own* wondrous achievement of reaching Level 55 and finally 
    getting Life Magic, which is equally worthy of a huge celebration (if not 
    more so). You are so selfish! *sigh* </span><br>

    Monarch Has Abandoned You!</span></b></p>
    <p>So, Gheres started messaging me last night right after I logged on -- he 
    does that, sometimes -- and he told me, straight off, that my monarch had 
    abandoned me, and obviously didn't care about me any more. Rather than ask 
    why, I simply replied that it was totally untrue. I stated that, in fact, 
    you would very soon be completely revamping your site, making it be about 
    ME, about Ned Cleversun. I told him that the occasion was my recent 
    ascendance to level 80 and my establishment as a great warrior. I said that 
    you were even considering changing the URL, from thejackcat.com to 
    itsallaboutned.com. He sounded doubtful but unsure. Ha.</p>

    best vassal on Dereth has not diminished once he realizes that I have 
    revamped my site into a paean celebrating your virtuous goodness! </span>
